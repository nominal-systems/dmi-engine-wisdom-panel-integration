A well-known author and expert on hunting dogs, who wrote under the pen name Hegewald, convinced hunters to cross [Poodles]({%breedURL poodle-standard%}) with [English Pointers]({%breedURL pointer%}). His goal was to create a breed that combined the Poodle's love of water, trainability, retrieving skills, and protective coat with the English Pointer's keen nose, pointing instincts, and zeal for hunting.\n\nBreeders used far more Pointers than Poodles when establishing the breeding program. And once they achieved the look and character they were after, they no longer relied on Pointers and, instead, mated Pudelpointers to other Pudelpointers. The breed register was founded in 1892, and breeders formed the first Pudelpointer club in 1897.\n\nH.D. Hume and Sigbot Winterhelt introduced the breed to North America in 1956. Today, most Pudelpointers are bred in Germany or the United States. The United Kennel Club recognized the breed in 2006, and the American Kennel Club has recorded it in their Foundation Stock Service since 2016."

                 "en" : "The German Shorthaired Pointer, or GSP, was developed in Germany in the late 19th century to meet the need for an all-round hunting dog. Breeders sought to develop an excellent pointer with a good noseâa dog that could retrieve birds as well as animals.\n\nInitially, German hunters thought that a cross between a Spanish Pointer and Hannover Hound would possess these abilities. However, the resulting breed tended to bay when trailing. They then tried crosses with the Bloodhound, Foxhound, and various French hounds. But none hit the mark precisely.\n\nBreeding with the English Pointer finally resulted in a dog that appeared perfect. Still, even this breed had an aversion to water and tracking at times. Fortunately, continuous breeding eliminated these unwanted traits. And the German Shorthaired Pointer became a lean, athletic, and responsive breed.\n\nThe German Kennel Club first registered the breed in 1872. German Shorthaired Pointers arrived in the United States in the 1920s. Impressed by the versatility of the breed after reading an article about it, a man named Charles R. Thornton shipped two dogs to his home in Missoula, Montana.\n\nThe American Kennel Club recognized the German Shorthaired Pointer as a breed in 1930. Today, it's consistently one of the top-winning breeds in competitive hunting events."

He wanted a breed that could hunt a variety of game on all types of terrain. So, he selected dogs with high strength and endurance, talented noses, water-repellent coats, and cooperative natures. The result was a robust dog that had all the characteristics of an exceptional pointer and retriever.\n\nKorthals continued his breeding program when he moved to Germany, and eventually France. The breed standard was established in 1886, and the Wirehaired Pointing Griffon quickly gained popularity throughout Europe. The breed earned AKC recognition in 1887, though it was mistakenly labeled a Russian Setter. Today, most Wirehaired Pointing Griffons are still bred in France."

                 "en" : "Dogs that carry this mutation are asymptomatic until they are exposed to a medication that uses the pump that is rendered defective by the mutation in the MDR1 (also called ABCB1) gene. Drugs known to use this P-glycoprotein pump are macrocyclic lactones (antiparasitic drugs), loperamide (antidiarrheal), erythromycin (antibiotic), acepromazine (tranquilizer), butorphanol (opioid), and certain drugs used in cancer treatment (vincristine, vinblastine, and doxorubicin). When these medications are administered, they accumulate in the brain which results in the adverse reactions. Typical symptoms include tremors, loss of balance, seizures, obtundation, excessive salivation, dilated pupils, and bradycardia. If untreated, the condition may lead to respiratory arrest, coma or death. Because dogs with one copy of the mutation will have some P-glycoprotein function, the most severe cases tend to occur in dogs that have two copies of the mutation and therefore lack any functional P-glycoprotein pumps. However, the condition can still be very severe in dogs that have only one copy of the mutation.\n",

Os medicamentos que utilizam esta bomba de glicoproteÃ­na-P sÃ£o as lactonas macrocÃ­clicas (antiparasitÃ¡rios), a loperamida (antidiarreico), a eritromicina (antibiÃ³tico), a acepromazina (tranquilizante), o butorfanol (opiÃ¡ceo) e alguns medicamentos utilizados no tratamento do cancro (vincristina, vinblastina e doxorrubicina). Quando estes medicamentos sÃ£o administrados, acumulam-se no cÃ©rebro, o que resulta em reaÃ§Ãµes adversas. Os sinais tÃ­picos sÃ£o tremores, perda de equilÃ­brio, convulsÃµes, obtundaÃ§Ã£o, excesso de salivaÃ§Ã£o, pupilas dilatadas e bradicardia. Se nÃ£o for tratada, a doenÃ§a pode conduzir a uma paragem respiratÃ³ria, coma ou morte. Os cÃ£es com uma cÃ³pia da mutaÃ§Ã£o apresentam alguma funÃ§Ã£o da glicoproteÃ­na-P, sendo que os casos mais graves se detetam em cÃ£es com duas cÃ³pias da mutaÃ§Ã£o e que por carecem de bombas da glicoproteÃ­na-P funcionais. No entanto, mesmo nos cÃ£es que tenham apenas uma cÃ³pia da mutaÃ§Ã£o, a doenÃ§a pode ser igualmente grave."
