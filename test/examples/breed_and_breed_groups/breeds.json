Romanian law requires working dogs to wear a dangle, or “jujău”—a stick or stave hung from a chain around the neck in front of the legs—to show that free-ranging Bucovinas are owned by shepherds, and to discourage them from hunting wildlife.\n\nThe Romanian Kennel Club wrote the first Bucovina Shepherd Dog breed standard in 1982 and in 2019, the breed was fully recognized by FCI.\n\nDespite their long history as fierce protectors in remote rural landscapes, modern Bucovinas have transitioned nicely into low-key family life.","facts":"Romanian Bucovina Shepherd Dogs are courageous working dogs with a soft spot for children. They have a calm, protective nature and are incredibly loyal to their human pack. ","traits-appearance":"The Bucovina Shepherd Dog is a large dog with a proud, commanding appearance. Male dogs are typically taller and stronger than females.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Bucovina's body is covered in long, abundant, straight hair. They also have a short, dense undercoat and a thick mane around the neck. The hair on their legs forms fringes, and they have thick, bushy tails.\n\nTypically, Bucovinas have clear white coats with patches of gray, black, or dark sable. Some dogs have black or gray ticking on their legs. Though not encouraged, solid-colored white, beige, gray, or black coats are acceptable within the breed standard.","traits-physical":"Recognizable breed traits include a massive head, relatively small almond-shaped eyes, and high-set, v-shaped ears. These dogs also have a strong, muscular body, moderately long legs, and a high-set tail that curves slightly upward when alert. Rear dewclaws may occur.","temperament":"Bucovina Shepherd Dogs are guardians through and through. They have all of the typical personality traits you'd expect of a rustic working dog, including bravery, loyalty, and a calm, balanced nature.\n\nAlso common among natural watchdogs, Bucovinas have a booming bark that serves as a warning to potential threats and a natural wariness of strangers. But while they might not immediately take to newcomers, they are devoted to their family members and have a particular fondness for children. ","care-nutrition":"When they are puppies, Bucovina Shepherd Dogs may benefit from a large-breed growth diet. These specially formulated diets help prevent large-breed puppies from growing too fast, which may decrease the likelihood or severity of hip dysplasia as they age. Adult Bucovinas thrive on high-quality dog food formulated for their age and activity level.\n\nObesity in dogs is on the rise. To help your dog maintain a healthy weight, measure their meals to avoid overfeeding and keep an eye on how many treats you give them. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of their daily calories.","care-grooming":"Bucovina Shepherd Dogs don't need baths, but their coats require regular brushing. A weekly once-over with a long-toothed comb will do the job for most of the year. However, more frequent brushing may be needed when they shed their undercoats in the spring.\n\nTo keep them in tip-top shape, regular ear cleanings and nail trims should also be part of their grooming routine. Additionally, consistent [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) will support their overall health. In addition to professional cleanings, establish an at-home dental care program that includes regular teeth brushing and veterinarian-recommended dental chews.","care-exercise":"Bucovina Shepherds aren't hyperactive dogs, but they need plenty of daily exercise to help them stay happy and healthy. Long walks with their humans, games in the backyard, and puzzle toys will keep them physically and mentally fit.","care-training":"If it were up to them, this independent, stubborn breed would be the one calling the shots. To set the proper tone, establish yourself as the pack leader from the beginning and use firm but gentle training techniques. \n\t\nAdditionally, all breeds will benefit from [early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization). Getting them comfortable with different people and environments when they're young will help them develop into well-adjusted adult dogs.","care-health":null,"references":"http://www.fci.be/Nomenclature/Standards/357g02-en.pdf\n\nhttps://ciobanescromanescdebucovina.com/\n\nhttps://www.mascotarios.org/en/pastor-rumano-de-bucovina/\n\nhttps://clubnationalbucovina.ro/\n\nhttps://predator-friendly-ranching.blogspot.com/2018/03/wolf-collars-dangles-and-yokes.html","reviewed-by":"Casey

Laikas","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The Laika is a hunting dog found in northern Russia and Siberia. The breed belongs to the Spitz family of dogs—the group most closely related to wolves. Experts believe the Laika's ancestors crossed with wolves and were selectively bred for temperament. The result of that effort is the breed we know today.\n\nSiberian hunters couldn't afford specialized dogs for different types of prey. So, the Laika became an all-around hunter used for birds and assorted small game. These dogs bark to alert the hunter when they locate game. That's how they got their name—the Russian word \"laika\" is a noun derived from the verb \"layat,\" which means \"barker.\"","facts":"Laikas are intelligent, energetic, and watchful dogs. Though originally bred for hunting, they make good guard dogs due to their attentive nature.","traits-appearance":"Laikas are medium-sized, powerfully built dogs with a wolf-like appearance.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Laikas have a thick double coat with harsh, straight hairs and a soft undercoat that protects them in arctic weather. Though usually black and white, their coats may also be red or pale red. And some Laikas are \"wolf\" grey—similar to their early ancestors. Grey coats can vary from very light to very dark and may have white patches in different proportions.","traits-physical":"The breed has a wedge-shaped head, dark, oval eyes, prick ears, and a tail that curls over the back.","temperament":"The Laika is a courageous, intelligent, highly versatile breed. These dogs are protective of their people and make excellent guard dogs. But they can sometimes be aloof or cautious with strangers.\n\nIt's essential to socialize these dogs so that they learn how to respond appropriately to different people and situations. Consistent training and reinforcement can also help them overcome any natural tendencies to guard toys, food, or other objects when sharing a household with other pets.","care-nutrition":"Laikas thrive on a high-quality diet formulated for their activity level, medium size, and life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). To help them maintain a healthy weight, monitor their food intake—including treats. As a rule, treats should make up no more than 10% of their calories.","care-grooming":"Laikas are naturally clean dogs that don't produce much (if any) smell. But their thick coats do need regular brushing to remove loose hair and prevent mats and tangles.\n\nMost of the year, brushing with a pin brush once or twice a week will suffice. But during seasonal shedding periods, daily brushing is needed to keep the hair from getting out of control.\n\nBeyond that, regular nail trims, ear cleanings, and teeth brushing should also be part of your pup's grooming routine.","care-exercise":"This active breed needs a lot of daily exercise to be happy and healthy. Long walks, hikes, and games within a fenced backyard will give these dogs an outlet for their boundless energy.","care-training":"Laikas are intelligent and very responsive to training. But they can be independent thinkers. So, a firm, consistent approach using positive reinforcement and rewards is the best way to teach these pups.","care-health":null,"references":"https://russkaja-laika.jimdofree.com/laika-breeds/\n\nhttps://www.ukcdogs.com/west-siberian-laika\n\nhttps://www.petguide.com/breeds/dog/west-siberian-laika/\n\nhttps://wagwalking.com/breed/west-siberian-laika","reviewed-by":null,"date-reviewed":null,"weight-range-pet-min":18.0,"weight-range-pet-max":30.0,"weight-range-show-min":18.0,"weight-range-show-max":30.0,"height-range-min":50.0,"height-range-max":63.0,"life-span-range-min":10.0,"life-span-range-max":12.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":null,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":null,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":null},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0170f6c4-1a1e-51ab-bb96-38f3241c879a/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0170f6c4-1a1e-51ab-bb96-38f3241c879a/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0170f6c4-1a1e-51ab-bb96-38f3241c879a/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0170f6c4-1a1e-51ab-bb96-38f3241c879a/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0170f6c4-1a1e-51ab-bb96-38f3241c879a/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0170f6c4-1a1e-51ab-bb96-38f3241c879a/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0170f6c4-1a1e-51ab-bb96-38f3241c879a/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0170f6c4-1a1e-51ab-bb96-38f3241c879a/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0170f6c4-1a1e-51ab-bb96-38f3241c879a/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0170f6c4-1a1e-51ab-bb96-38f3241c879a/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0170f6c4-1a1e-51ab-bb96-38f3241c879a/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0170f6c4-1a1e-51ab-bb96-38f3241c879a/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0170f6c4-1a1e-51ab-bb96-38f3241c879a/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0170f6c4-1a1e-51ab-bb96-38f3241c879a/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0170f6c4-1a1e-51ab-bb96-38f3241c879a/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0170f6c4-1a1e-51ab-bb96-38f3241c879a/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0170f6c4-1a1e-51ab-bb96-38f3241c879a/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0170f6c4-1a1e-51ab-bb96-38f3241c879a/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"018cf916-7226-5ab8-8df8-8394b050f063","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/018cf916-7226-5ab8-8df8-8394b050f063"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"tibetan-spaniel","name":"Tibetan Spaniel","plural-name":"Tibetan Spaniels","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The Tibetan Spaniel is a native Tibetan dog breed that may have shared ancestry with the Japanese Chin and Pekingese. It is one of three native Tibetan breeds in the non-sporting group.\n\nThe ancient breed traces its roots to Buddhist monasteries where monks kept the so-called Tibbies as companions and watchdogs more than 3,000 years ago. Tibetan Spaniels could be found sitting atop temple walls and scanning the surrounding countryside. Local lore says the dogs even turned prayer wheels for the monks. In addition to being an excellent watchdog, the Tibetan Spaniel was also a favorite companion.\n\nIn Tibet, where lions are considered sacred, the Tibetan Spaniel’s lion-like appearance made the breed highly regarded; these dogs were often given as gifts to palaces in Buddhist countries.","facts":"Though small in stature, Tibetan Spaniels rise to the roles of watchdogs and devoted, faithful companions.","traits-appearance":"Tibetan Spaniels are small, active, alert dogs with well-balanced appearances, and quick-moving gaits.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"These double-coated dogs have moderate-length, silky hair covering their bodies; it is smooth on the face and front legs, where it lies flat. The hair is feathered on the ears and back of the forelegs, while longer and well-furnished on the tail and buttocks. The neck is covered with a mane of longer hair that is more pronounced on males than females.\n\nWhen showing a Tibetan Spaniel, the hair must be unaltered; the coat should lie naturally with no teasing, parting, or styling; the feathering on the toes must not be trimmed but hair growing between the pads on the underside of the feet can be trimmed.\n\nAll colors and mixtures of colors are allowed with the most common being black, black and tan, cream, gold, red, sable, white, and silver sable with parti-color or white markings.","traits-physical":"Tibetan Spaniels are more long than tall (but should not be too long-bodied or low to the ground). The breed has a small head with dark brown, oval-shaped, expressive eyes set far apart. Its medium-sized, pendant-shaped ears are set high and well-feathered. Its medium-length, blunt muzzle is free from wrinkles. The tail is also set high, richly plumed, and makes a gay curl over their backs.","temperament":"Tibetan Spaniels are assertive, intelligent, and self-confident. They have independent spirits and value their roles as watchdogs but also form close bonds with their owners and make friendly, playful companions. Tibetan Spaniels can be aloof with strangers.\n\nThanks to centuries of working as watchdogs, Tibetan Spaniels have keen senses of hearing and sight. They bark as a warning that a stranger is approaching but do not bark without reason and are quiet enough for apartment living. The breed is adaptable to most lifestyles, including homes with other pets.\n\nTibetan Spaniels are sensitive companion animals that want to be with their owners and will be unhappy when left alone for too long.","care-nutrition":"Feed Tibetan Spaniels a high-quality dog food that is appropriate for their life stage (puppy, adult, senior) and consider a diet formulated for small breeds. Portion out their food with a standard measuring cup and limit treats to no more than 10% of their daily calories to prevent overfeeding.","care-grooming":"Tibetan Spaniels have minimal grooming requirements. Regular brushing (with special attention to the longest hair behind their ears and on their rear fringes) can keep painful mats from forming. Groomers must be advised not to cut the hair on their bellies or between their legs—called a sanitary cut—because it can cause severe itchiness. Occasional baths will minimize shedding and keep them looking and smelling great.\n\nNail trims, ear cleaning, and [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care), including at-home teeth-brushing and professional cleanings, are also essential for good grooming.","care-exercise":"Tibetan Spaniels do not need a lot of exercise. A daily walk or time to explore a fenced yard will suffice for these dogs but, given the chance, Tibetan Spaniels will also take part in more active pursuits such as agility, scent work, rally, and obedience. Once their workout is done, their favorite thing is a perch that allows them to look out over their territories and take in the surroundings.","care-training":"Tibetan Spaniels are alert, smart, and eager to please but also have stubborn, independent streaks.

As civilizations developed, cats became helpful partners in pest control. But before selective breeding began in the 19th century, cats were—and mostly still are—non-pedigreed.\n\nFeral cats are very common in Korea, with populations running rampant in big cities. Historically, many people in Korea had a negative perception of cats. Some viewed them as bad luck, while others considered street cats messy and noisy nuisances. Though attitudes have shifted in recent decades, mistreatment at the hands of humans has left many Korean street cats fearful of people.","facts":"Korean street cats are feral cats that share the same basic physical characteristics as pet cats, but they lead a mostly independent life outdoors.","traits-appearance":"Korean street cats come in all shapes and sizes. Signs of a life-long street cat— versus a stray cat who may be lost— include a clean, well-kept coat (thanks to their meticulous self-grooming), protective body language, and lack of eye contact.

Though they may live near people, they are not typically accustomed to human contact. Most are fearful of being handled or confined. But some can adapt to interactions with people and learn to live indoors.","care-nutrition":"A Korean street cat's diet typically consists of whatever they can find—scraps from trash cans, birds and rodents, handouts from kind strangers, and so on. If you're leaving food out for a street cat, they will benefit from the same commercially prepared diets as pet cats.","care-grooming":"Street Cats are typically fastidious groomers that keep their coats relatively clean.

The details of their earliest days, however, are up for debate.\n\nThe breed's resemblance to cats depicted in Egyptian artifacts has some people believing that the Abyssinian descends from the sacred cat of Ancient Egypt. Others think the breed's story started when a British soldier brought a cat from Abyssinia (now Ethiopia) to England in 1868—at the end of the Abyssinian war. But there's no hard evidence tying modern Abyssinians to that particular cat.\n\nRecent genetic research suggests Abyssinians most likely originated from the Bay of Bengal in India. Based on this finding, it's likely that merchants traveling between India and England brought the cats to Britain, where the breed's development took place.\n\nThe first Abyssinians arrived in the United States in the early 1900s, and American breeders worked quickly to develop breeding programs. In 1906, Abyssinians became one of the six inaugural breeds of the Cat Fancier's Association. From there, their popularity soared. And the Abyssinian is still one of the world's most beloved cat breeds.","facts":"Abyssinians are intelligent, curious cats that love to stay busy. This spirited, athletic breed can make a game (or a perch) out of anything. And their loyal personalities make them devoted family pets.","traits-appearance":"Abyssinians are medium-sized cats that bear a resemblance to their wildcat ancestors. They have ticked, tabby coats and dramatic facial markings.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Abyssinians' defining feature is their coat. Their short hair has a silky texture that bounces back into place when touched. Each hair is \"ticked\" with 4-6 bands of color that alternate between dark and light. The color at the root is lighter and matches their undersides, while the tip is dark.\n\nThe Cat Fanciers Association accepts four coat colors for the breed: ruddy, red, blue, and fawn. Ruddy coats have bands of color that alternate between dark sepia and bright orange, creating an overall burnt sienna look. Red cats have warm, red coats ticked with chocolate brown. Blue cats have beige coats ticked with slate blue. And fawn cats have rose-beige coats ticked with light brown.\n\nThe International Cat Association accepts ruddy, chocolate, cinnamon, blue, lilac, and fawn coat colors—as well as silver versions of these colors.","traits-physical":"Noted traits of the Abyssinian include a wedge-shaped head and large, somewhat pointed ears. Dark lines surrounded by a light color accentuate their almond-shaped eyes. Their bodies are muscular and well-balanced, and their legs are long and slim. They have relatively long tails that are thick at the base and taper.","temperament":"Abyssinians are curious, active cats that are always on the go. They often follow their humans around the house and patrol the area looking for ways to \"help.\" Need a fragile family heirloom moved from the top shelf to the floor? No problem, the athletic Aby can take care of that with a vertical leap and a swipe of the paw.\n\nBecause of their gravity-defying physical abilities (they can easily jump six feet in the air!), tall cat trees are essential for this breed. Without one, Abys are still likely to find their way to high places in the home, where they can perch and survey the outside world.\n\nAbyssinians are playful cats that keep their kitten-like attitudes into adulthood. Once they pick out a favorite toy, they will play with it for months. Until they won't. And once they've moved on, don't try to convince them to rekindle their enthusiasm. Feel free to buy them expensive toys, but know that a plastic bottle cap will keep them just as happy.\n\nEven though they are social and people-oriented, Abys aren't likely to be lap cats. There's no time for relaxing when there are so many things to do and explore.","care-nutrition":"Abyssinians require a high-quality diet. Because nutritional needs vary for kittens, adults, and senior cats, be sure to choose a formula that's age-appropriate for your pet.\n\nEven though Abys are active cats, they're still at risk for obesity if they overeat. To keep calories in check, portion out meals using a standard measuring cup, and reduce amounts if your cat gains weight. Also, as a reminder, treats should make up no more than 10% of their daily calories.\n\nIn addition to providing meals, make sure your cat always has access to fresh, clean water.","care-grooming":"Abyssinians have low-maintenance coats that don't shed very much. So, they need only occasional brushing to remove loose hair.\n\nYou should also trim your cat's nails every couple of weeks to prevent them from getting too long. Long nails are more likely to snag on something and become torn or damaged. And overgrown nails can grow into your cat's paw pads, leading to pain or infection.\n\nFinally, dental care is essential for every cat. Starting from kittenhood, brush your cat's teeth at home and schedule regular dental exams and cleanings with your veterinarian.","care-exercise":null,"care-training":null,"care-health":"Some breeds are more susceptible to certain health conditions. Abyssinians may be prone to patella luxation, a condition that causes the kneecap to slip out of position. They may also have a higher risk for renal amyloidosis—a disease caused by a build-up of an abnormal protein in the kidney. Your veterinarian is your best resource for discussing these and other health concerns for your cat.","references":"https://cfa.org/abyssinian/abyssinian-article/\n\nhttps://www.tica.org/breeds/browse-all-breeds?view=article&id=304:abyssinian-breed&catid=79\n\nhttps://cfa.org/cfa-news-releases/top-breeds-2019/\n\nhttps://cfa.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/abyssinian-standard.pdf\n\nhttps://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/cat-breeds/abyssinian\n\nhttps://www.tica.org/breeds/browse-all-breeds?view=article&id=1664:the-abyssinian-breed&catid=48","reviewed-by":"Laura

Terrier","plural-name":"Manchester Terriers","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"Hailing from Manchester, England, the Manchester Terrier historically hunted rats and rabbits. During the 19th century, England needed a solution for its massive rat problem. So, John Hulme crossed a [Whippet](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/whippet) and a dark brown terrier.\n\nThe resulting terrier breed was extremely popular among tavern owners who, after closing, would let the dogs roam their taverns to clear out the rats. The breed's supreme skill for this job earned it the nickname \"Rat Terrier.\" The name \"Manchester Terrier\" didn't arise until the 1860s—when Manchester became the dogs' breeding center.\n\nWhen Victorian women wanted a smaller companion, breeders created the Toy Manchester Terrier by breeding the smallest Standard Manchesters together.\n\nRegistered as separate breeds until 1959, the Standard Manchester and the Toy Manchester are now considered two varieties of the same breed. But the American Kennel Club groups the two varieties separately—the Standard Manchester is part of the terrier group while the Toy belongs to the toy group.","facts":"Manchester Terriers are energetic, intelligent, and alert dogs. They're also loyal, loving, and protective of family and territory. Two varieties of the Manchester Terrier exist: the Standard and the Toy. But except for different sizes and ear carriage standards, there are no major distinctions between the two.","traits-appearance":"A small, black, short-coated dog, the Manchester Terrier has a sleek yet substantial and refined appearance.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Manchester Terrier is jet black and rich mahogany tan. The tan markings are in similar locations on every Manchester Terrier.","traits-physical":"A long and wedge-shaped head and characteristic tan spots above the eyes are distinctive features of Manchester Terriers. The Standard variety can have either naturally erect, cropped, or button ears. Per the breed standard, the Toy variety can have only naturally erect ears.","temperament":"Small, clever, and confident dogs, Manchester Terriers can move at great speeds. They have amazing agility skills, too. But they aren't the best lap dogs.\n\nThat said, Manchester Terriers are usually affectionate with adults and children. In fact, they often bond quickly with people, demand attention, and enjoy lots of love. With bright and charming personalities, these pups make fine companions for any family. And thanks to their loud bark, they also serve well as watchdogs.\n\nKeep in mind that Manchester Terriers may be wary around strangers, and they sometimes attempt to hunt small animals.","care-nutrition":"Manchester Terriers thrive on a high-quality diet formulated for their age and size. Take care to monitor the amount of food your dog eats, and reduce portions if they gain excess weight. Also, remember that giving too many treats in addition to regular meals can contribute to obesity.","care-grooming":"Grooming is easy with the Manchester Terrier. Occasional baths and a weekly wipe with a hound glove or damp towel are all that it takes to keep this breed looking its best.\n\nEvery couple of weeks, you should also trim your dog's nails to prevent splitting. Likewise, aim to check your Manchester Terrier's ears regularly to avoid a buildup of wax and debris.\n\nLastly, establishing a good [dental hygiene](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) routine will support your dog's overall health. In addition to professional cleanings, regularly brush your pup's teeth at home and consider giving veterinarian-recommended dental chews.","care-exercise":"Quick and lively, Manchester Terriers are athletic dogs that need daily walks to support their mental and physical well-being.\n\nThough these pups may enjoy life as couch potatoes some of the time, they're usually eager to chase a ball or run in the great outdoors. Manchester Terriers also enjoy dog sports—such as agility, tracking, flyball, and both rally and competitive obedience.","care-training":"Manchester Terriers are easy to train and eager learners that like to show off their abilities. Your pup's training should start early and be firm (yet gentle) and consistent.\n\nThough Manchester Terriers can be stubborn, they thrive in a reward-based training environment. Treats and favorite toys provide excellent motivation.\n\nAll dogs benefit from [early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization), as it helps them be more comfortable around other animals and strangers.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Toy_Manchester_Terrier/L-4KBgAAQBAJ\n\nhttps://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/manchester-terrier-toy/\n\nhttps://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/manchester-terrier-standard/","reviewed-by":"Annette Louviere, DVM","date-reviewed":"2021-07-09T19:21:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":1.8,"weight-range-pet-max":11.3,"weight-range-show-min":2.7,"weight-range-show-max":8.2,"height-range-min":25.0,"height-range-max":41.0,"life-span-range-min":14.0,"life-span-range-max":17.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":null,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":null,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":null},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/03c4656c-7f26-550a-bd30-1424b052547b/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/03c4656c-7f26-550a-bd30-1424b052547b/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/03c4656c-7f26-550a-bd30-1424b052547b/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/03c4656c-7f26-550a-bd30-1424b052547b/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/03c4656c-7f26-550a-bd30-1424b052547b/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/03c4656c-7f26-550a-bd30-1424b052547b/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/03c4656c-7f26-550a-bd30-1424b052547b/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/03c4656c-7f26-550a-bd30-1424b052547b/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/03c4656c-7f26-550a-bd30-1424b052547b/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/03c4656c-7f26-550a-bd30-1424b052547b/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/03c4656c-7f26-550a-bd30-1424b052547b/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/03c4656c-7f26-550a-bd30-1424b052547b/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/03c4656c-7f26-550a-bd30-1424b052547b/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/03c4656c-7f26-550a-bd30-1424b052547b/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/03c4656c-7f26-550a-bd30-1424b052547b/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/03c4656c-7f26-550a-bd30-1424b052547b/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/03c4656c-7f26-550a-bd30-1424b052547b/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/03c4656c-7f26-550a-bd30-1424b052547b/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"0414ed26-5fae-573b-be5d-190eb6b83274","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0414ed26-5fae-573b-be5d-190eb6b83274"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"dutch-shepherd-dog","name":"Dutch Shepherd Dog","plural-name":"Dutch Shepherd Dogs","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"Dutch Shepherds—also known as the Dutchie or Hollandse Herdershond—originated from rural areas in what is now part of the Netherlands. Farmers needed a well-rounded breed that could herd cows, pull carts to market, guard the farm, and watch the children. The Dutch Shepherd fit the bill.\n\nThe Nederlandse Herdershonden Club developed the first breed standard in 1898. The original standard allowed all coat colors, but the standard was edited in 1914 to limit the Dutch Shepherd's coloring to brindle. This change was to distinguish it from other shepherd breeds, such as the [German Shepherd](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/german-shepherd-dog) and [Belgian Shepherd](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/belgian-sheepdog).\n\nThe Dutch Shepherd's versatile nature and strong work ethic have made this lesser-known breed popular for many jobs. Today they work as farm dogs, police dogs, search and rescue dogs, and guide dogs for owners with disabilities.","facts":"Dutch Shepherds are athletic, intelligent, and independent dogs. Innate herding instincts have helped the breed earn a reputation as a world-class working dog that retains its wild ancestors' characteristics.","traits-appearance":"Dutch Shepherds are medium-sized athletic dogs with hard, muscular, well-balanced bodies. They have free and smooth movements, endless endurance, and intelligent expressions.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Dutch Shepherds can have three different kinds of coats: short-hair, long-hair, and rough-hair. The short-hair coat is hard, close-fitting, and not too short, with the ruff, breaches, and tail plume visible.\n\nThe long-hair coat is long and straight (without curls or waves), and harsh to the touch. The ruff, breeches, and tail are distinct and abundantly coated while the hair on their heads, ears, feet, and hind legs below the hocks is short and densely coated.\n\nThe rough-hair coat is dense, harsh, and tousled. The hair on the upper and lower lips forms a mustache and beard. The hair over the eyes forms well defined, coarse eyebrows that are distinct but not exaggerated.\n\nIn all three coat types, the Dutch Shepherd has a woolly undercoat.\n\nDutch Shepherds are brindle in color. Their base color is silver or golden. In golden dogs, the base color can range from light sand to chestnut red with black or dark brown brindle. They may have a small amount of white on their chest or toes.\n\nThe brindle color may be less pronounced in Dutch Shepherds with rough coats because the tousled coat obscures the coloring.","traits-physical":"Dutch Shepherds have solid, muscular bodies; deep, long chests; powerful legs; and tails that hang down with a slight curve. They have dark, almond-shaped eyes; medium-sized, erect ears; and strong jaws.","temperament":"Dutch Shepherds are alert, watchful, reliable dogs that delight in completing a task. The breed is confident enough to work solo but also cooperative and willing to work alongside its owner or other dogs to get the job done. Their demeanors as active, independent, and persistent.\n\nDespite being bred for work, Dutch Shepherds know how to relax and will adjust their energy levels to the situation. As pets, Dutch Shepherds love spending time with their people and fit in well with active families. This is not a breed that wants to be left alone for long periods with nothing to do.","care-nutrition":"Feed Dutch Shepherds a high-quality dog food that is appropriate for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior) and consider a diet formulated for active breeds. Although these high-energy dogs are not known for becoming overweight, portioning out their food with a measuring cup and limiting treats to no more than 10% of their daily calories can help prevent overfeeding.","care-grooming":"A Dutch Shepherd's grooming needs depend on its coat type. The short-coated dogs require only occasional brushing, while long-haired Dutch Shepherds must be brushed once per week. Both short-and long-haired dogs will need extra brushing during spring and fall shedding seasons to remove cast-off hair and reduce shedding. In addition to brushing rough-coated Dutch Shepherds once per month, their coats need to be hand-stripped twice per year. A professional groomer can help.\n\nDutch Shepherds also require regular ear cleanings, nail trims, and a [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) routine that includes at-home teeth-brushing and professional cleanings. Start these grooming essentials when Dutch Shepherds are puppies to ensure they are part of a lifelong habit.","care-exercise":"These all-purpose working dogs love to be on the move. Dutch Shepherds make great running companions and enjoy brisk walks, hiking, swimming, and trips to the dog park. These highly intelligent dogs also excel in agility, obedience, rally, dock diving, and—of course—herding. Mental stimulation is important, too. Puzzle toys and other games are helpful ways to keep their minds engaged.","care-training":"With proper obedience training, Dutch Shepherds listen to their owners and follow instructions. However, without this training, they tend to be independent and make their own decisions. Avoid repetitive activities—these will cause Dutch Shepherds to lose interest. Fast-paced games and activities that combine mental and physical stimulation are best to keep them engaged (and help burn off energy). Focus on positive reinforcement and reward-based

Terrier","plural-name":"Tibetan Terriers","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The Tibetan Terrier is an ancient breed that, despite its name, is not a terrier at all. The breed hails from Tibet, China where it lived in Buddhist monasteries, serving as watchdogs and companions.\n\nLamas treasured Tibetan Terriers, keeping them as good luck charms. Often given as gifts, Tibetan Terriers represented a sign of respect or good fortune. Their prized place in Tibetan culture helped the breed earn the nickname “Holy Dogs of Tibet.”\n\nTibetan Terriers are also agile, surefooted, and powerful jumpers that may have worked as herders, flock guardians, and retrievers, working in extreme climates and difficult terrain.","facts":"The Tibetan Terrier is known for being a sensitive, affectionate breed. With a long history as watchdogs, Tibetan Terriers are just as likely to monitor their surroundings as they are to snuggle with their families.","traits-appearance":"The Tibetan Terrier is a medium-sized dog with well-balanced proportions, a powerful build, and effortless gait. They have medium-length, heavily furnished tails that curl up and fall over their backs. Tibetan Terriers also have large eyes and pendant ears.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Tibetan Terriers have double coats with soft, woolly undercoats and profuse, fine—but not silky or woolly—outercoats that may be straight or wavy. While their coats are long, they should not hang to the ground.\n\nPuppies have shorter coats with softer textures than adults. In the show ring, no scissoring, trimming or sculpting of the coats is permitted.\n\nAll colors or combinations of colors are acceptable. The most common colors include black, black and white, brindle, gold, sable, and white and black.","traits-physical":"One of the Tibetan Terrier’s most unique traits is their large, flat feet. Their feet are round in shape, the pads are thick and strong with abundant hair between the toes and pads, giving Tibetan Terriers snowshoe-like traction. This unique physical attribute helped Tibetan Terriers navigate the snowy, mountainous terrain in their native Tibet.","temperament":"The Tibetan Terrier is a highly intelligent breed. With their owners, these dogs are sensitive, loyal, and devoted, but they’re often cautious or reserved with strangers. Tibetan Terriers are good with children and other pets and appreciate relationships based on cooperation, trust, and respect.\n\nThanks to their watchdog roots, Tibetan Terriers are alert and want to protect their owners and territories, often barking at signs of perceived danger. Training can help these dogs distinguish between typical household/outdoor sounds and noises that could signal trouble. With training, Tibetan Terriers can be quiet, respectful apartment dogs.","care-nutrition":"Feed Tibetan Terriers a high-quality dog food that is appropriate for their life stage (puppy, adult, senior). These dogs are not prone to overeating and will often savor their food, even leaving some behind. It’s still best to portion out their food with a measuring cup and ensure that treats make up no more than 10 percent of their daily calories to avoid overfeeding.","care-grooming":"Despite their long hair, Tibetan Terriers require minimal grooming. Their coats can withstand the elements, which means this breed\n\nLike all breeds, Tibetan Terriers benefit from a regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) routine that includes at-home teeth brushing and professional cleanings.","care-exercise":"Tibetan Terriers don’t require a lot of exercise, but they appreciate regular walks, games in the backyard, or trips to the dog park. These dogs are also good at “self-exercise” and will play with toys to burn off their energy. Tibetan Terriers also enjoy working alongside their owners and enjoy activities such as agility, rally, and nose work.\n\nThese one-time watchdogs appreciate a spot where they can look out the window to survey their surroundings.","care-training":"Tibetan Terriers have an independent streak and, though they are quick learners, may choose not to follow directions and will shut down if training is repetitive or harsh. Use positive reinforcement and reward-based training to teach Tibetan Terriers basic commands and new tricks. Prioritize a mix of mental and physical stimulation to keep training fresh and engaging.\n\n[Socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) is also important to satisfy their curious, outgoing personalities.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/tibetan-terrier/\n\nhttp://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/TibetanTerrier.pdf","reviewed-by":"Cindy Elston, DVM, MPH","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":8.2,"weight-range-pet-max":15.0,"weight-range-show-min":7.7,"weight-range-show-max":13.2,"height-range-min":36.0,"height-range-max":41.0,"life-span-range-min":12.0,"life-span-range-max":16.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":98,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":58,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":40},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/05f75db4-8301-58cb-bb15-59d0dc4bf2c6/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/05f75db4-8301-58cb-bb15-59d0dc4bf2c6/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/05f75db4-8301-58cb-bb15-59d0dc4bf2c6/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/05f75db4-8301-58cb-bb15-59d0dc4bf2c6/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/05f75db4-8301-58cb-bb15-59d0dc4bf2c6/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/05f75db4-8301-58cb-bb15-59d0dc4bf2c6/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/05f75db4-8301-58cb-bb15-59d0dc4bf2c6/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/05f75db4-8301-58cb-bb15-59d0dc4bf2c6/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/05f75db4-8301-58cb-bb15-59d0dc4bf2c6/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/05f75db4-8301-58cb-bb15-59d0dc4bf2c6/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/05f75db4-8301-58cb-bb15-59d0dc4bf2c6/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/05f75db4-8301-58cb-bb15-59d0dc4bf2c6/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/05f75db4-8301-58cb-bb15-59d0dc4bf2c6/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/05f75db4-8301-58cb-bb15-59d0dc4bf2c6/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/05f75db4-8301-58cb-bb15-59d0dc4bf2c6/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/05f75db4-8301-58cb-bb15-59d0dc4bf2c6/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/05f75db4-8301-58cb-bb15-59d0dc4bf2c6/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/05f75db4-8301-58cb-bb15-59d0dc4bf2c6/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"061b99f4-1da9-5487-b5d3-a6a6921f87ce","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/061b99f4-1da9-5487-b5d3-a6a6921f87ce"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"coton-de-tulear","name":"Coton de Tulear","plural-name":"Cotons de Tulear","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The Coton de Tulear has a long association with the high seas. Sailors chose this breed as their ship companions. These little white dogs chased rats and provided endless entertainment—and made excellent items for barter. The Coton de Tulear owes its name to its arrival at the port of Tulear in Madagascar, an island nation with a significant French-speaking population.\n\nThe Coton de Tulear is a member of the Bichon family of dogs and believed to be a descendant of a Spanish breed known as the Bichon Tenerife. Regardless of its origins, Madagascar's ruling aristocrats fell in love with the charming good looks and comedic personalities of the Coton de Tulear and adopted it as their preferred breed. At one point, it was the exclusive breed of nobles and illegal for commoners to own. It became known as the Royal Dog of Madagascar. The dogs rarely left the island, keeping their bloodlines pure for centuries.\n\nFrench travelers discovered the breed during a visit to Madagascar in the 1960s. They exported Coton de Tulears to Europe, where the breed was an immediate hit.","facts":"The Coton de Tulear has only had one job in its long history: providing companionship and joy to its owners. This charming, outgoing, and happy-go-lucky breed excels in its work—making it a popular breed worldwide.","traits-appearance":"The Coton de Tulear is an intelligent, energetic, and sometimes boisterous little dog with a pure white coat.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"As its name suggests, the Coton de Tulear has a cotton-like coat. The coat is dense and profuse and can have a light wave. Puppies have much softer coats than adult dogs.\n\nThe Coton de Tulear comes in a single color: white. According to the breed standard, their ears and bodies can have slight shadings of light grey or light tan.","traits-physical":"The Coton de Tulear has a small, almost triangular-shaped head and straight muzzle. Pendulous ears, rounded black or dark brown eyes, and a curious, alert expression contribute to this little dog's adorable appearance.","temperament":"Coton de Tulears are known for their friendly, stable natures and ability to adapt to a variety of circumstances. These little dogs can handle apartment living, wide-open spaces, desert heat, or winter snow—as long as their families are near.\n\nIn addition to being excellent lap dogs, Coton de Tulears are natural entertainers. They love learning new tricks (their signature move is walking on their hind legs) and delighting their humans. Their outgoing nature and love of attention make them excellent therapy dogs.\n\nThough generally quiet, Coton de Tulears can become very vocal when having fun. They get along with most people and other pets. Because they'd rather be with people than alone, this breed is prone to separation anxiety.","care-nutrition":"When choosing the right diet for a Coton de Tulear, look for high-quality dog foods appropriate for their age and breed size. Like all dogs, Coton de Tulears are at risk for obesity if they overeat—and calories can add up quickly for such a little dog. Avoid overfeeding by measuring their meals and keeping treats to less than 10% of their daily calories.","care-grooming":"The natural hair of a Coton de Tulear requires regular brushing to remove dirt and prevent it from becoming tangled and matted. Be sure to brush the hair starting at the skin. Failing to run the brush through the entire length of their hair could create painful mats close to the skin. A spray-on conditioner designed for dogs can prevent the hair from breaking and allow a comb to glide through more easily. Some Coton de Tulears get a \"puppy clip\" to keep their hair short and minimize their grooming requirements. Regular nail trims are also necessary.\n\nCoton de Tulears will benefit from regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care). Start brushing their teeth at home when they're young and talk to a veterinarian about professional dental cleanings to ensure good oral hygiene throughout their lives.","care-exercise":"Coton de Tulears are active dogs that require regular exercise. Due to their small size, short walks are better than long hikes. They have a playful nature, so add in games like fetch and provide plenty of toys to keep them engaged.

They were working dogs who were kept busy guarding the farms, driving cattle, and providing companionship. As drafting dogs, they could pull multiple times their own weight due to their strength and fortitude.\n\nAs the breed began to dwindle in the 1800s, Swiss fans of the dog took it upon themselves to help the Bernese Mountain Dog make a comeback. A Swiss breed club was formed in 1907, led by Professor Albert Heim. The breed made its debut in America in 1926 in Kansas. Although imported as farm dogs, their usefulness and sweet temper popularized them, and in 1937 the breed was registered with the American Kennel Club.","facts":"This large breed is intelligent, strong, self-confident, and generally easygoing. They bond strongly to their people, and they don’t do well when they are left alone for long periods of time. Although Bernese Mountain Dogs—or Berners—are protective and may be aloof with strangers, they aren’t necessarily shy, and they don’t tend to be aggressive.","traits-appearance":"This large, striking breed is sturdy and strong, and despite its size, moves quickly with agility. The Berner has dark brown, friendly eyes and a thick, long tri-colored coat of black, rust, and white.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Bernese Mountain Dog has a long, glorious coat that is thick with a natural, bright sheen. They are tricolored, with a base coat of black and markings that are clear white and rust.","traits-physical":"The Bernese Mountain Dog’s large size is its most distinguishing characteristic. They have full, muscular bodies.","temperament":"These large-breed dogs do best in bigger homes, with plenty of outdoor space to roam. They bond strongly to their owners, and they don’t do well when left alone for long periods of time. While they don’t tend to be aggressive, they can be aloof with strangers, and proper training and socialization is very important.\n\nBecause of their heavy coat, Berners loves snow and the cold weather, but they are also susceptible to heat stroke for the same reasons and shouldn’t be kept in warm or hot climates. The Bernese Mountain Dog doesn’t tend to bark, but is known to dig, so any fencing should be extra secure.\n\nThe Bernese Mountain Dog is a versatile, loving breed that enjoys dog activities like agility, tracking and herding. They are gentle and good-natured with their people, but they can be aloof with strangers and their large size means they should always be supervised with small children. They don’t tend to bark a lot, but they don’t do well when they’re left alone. They can be protective—though not usually aggressive—and are known to dig.","care-nutrition":"Bernese Mountain Dogs require a high-quality dog food that is age-appropriate—whether it’s commercially manufactured or homemade (with a veterinarian’s supervision and approval). It’s important to monitor the amount of food you give your Bernese Mountain Dog. Reduce the portions or restrict calories if your pup gains weight. Your veterinarian is always a good source to help provide you with appropriate nutrition and feeding guidelines.","care-grooming":"The Bernese Mountain Dog has a double coat that sheds frequently and requires a fair bit of care. Weekly brushing should be fine on average, but during shedding season—which occurs twice a year—you’ll want to increase to a daily brushing schedule. Tangles should be worked on with a metal comb.\n\nAll dogs require regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care), including at-home teeth brushing and professional dental cleanings, and the Bernese Mountain Dog is no exception. Maintaining good dental hygiene is important for their overall long-term health.","care-exercise":"The Berner is a moderately active breed that requires about thirty minutes of exercise every day, including walks or hikes. Because of its thick double coat, the Bernese Mountain Dog does well in cold-weather climates, but is prone to overheat when it’s hot. This breed does well in dog sporting activities like agility and tracking.","care-training":"This smart and eager-to-please dog can be easy to train, but is sensitive and prefers positive reinforcement to harsh training techniques. Early training and socialization is important for Berners, but always remember that they prefer their specific people. When they are left alone for long periods of time they will likely get into trouble, no matter how much training they have.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.bmdca.org/breed_education/pdf/01_bernese_basics_about.pdf\n\nhttps://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/bernese-mountain-dog/\n\nhttp://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/BerneseMountainDog.pdf","reviewed-by":"Cindy

to the 1300s (at least). The earliest evidence of the breed exists in the Franciscan monastery in Dubrovnik, where four dogs resembling the Istrian Hound appear on the capitol column. The hounds also show up in paintings in cemetery chapels and churches from the late 1400s.\n\nExperts believe the breed descends from an ancient east Adriatic white hound. Historically, people have used the Istrian Short-Haired Hound for hunting rabbits and foxes in the rough, stony mountains of Istria.\n\nThe FCI published the first standard for the breed in 1955, and the United Kennel Club recognized it in 2006. Today, Istrians are rare—found primarily in their native land.","facts":"Istrian Short-Haired Hounds are calm, docile dogs with exceptional hunting abilities. They're also gentle, devoted, and easy to train. No wonder they've been beloved in their native country for centuries!","traits-appearance":"The Istrian Short-Haired Hound is a medium-sized dog with a strong body and noble appearance.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"This breed's coat is short, dense, fine, and glossy.

These dogs also have deep, broad chests, muscular back legs, and a long tail that curves slightly upward.","temperament":"Istrian Hounds are calm and laid-back at home and lively and enthusiastic when hunting. These gentle pups get very attached to their humans but are often wary of strangers. They are loyal and obedient with a powerful, persistent bark.","care-nutrition":"These hounds thrive on a high-quality diet formulated for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior).\n\nTo help your dog maintain a healthy weight, measure their portions to avoid overfeeding, and keep an eye on how many treats you're giving them. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of a pup's daily calories.","care-grooming":"Weekly brushing to remove loose fur and dirt and the occasional bath are generally sufficient to keep this breed's coat in tip-top shape. To reduce your dog's chance of ear infections, check their ears regularly and remove any wax build-up or debris.\n\nNail trims should also be part of every dog's grooming routine. If your pup's nails grow too long, they can cause pain and potentially lead to problems running or walking.\n\nGood [dental hygiene](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) is also important for your dog's overall health. Dental disease is one of the most common health conditions in adult dogs. Left untreated, it can contribute to other serious issues.

The Brussels Griffon—a descendent of several breeds, including the [English Toy Spaniel](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/english-toy-spaniel) and an old Belgian breed called the Brabancon—proved to be an ideal dog for the task. These dogs were not just good at capturing vermin. Brussels Griffons also excelled at capturing the attention of humans who saw them as affectionate, adorable companions.\n\nHenrietta Maria, Queen of the Belgians, fell in love with the Brussels Griffon, as did members of the upper classes. Refinement of the breed continued until smaller bodies and expressive faces became the Brussels Griffon's hallmark features.\n\nIn the early 1900s, Europe exported the first \"Griffs\" to America, where they achieved instant popularity. The Brussels Griffon that starred alongside Jack Nicholson in the movie *As Good As It Gets* helped the breed gain more recognition (and a lot of fans).","facts":"The Brussels Griffon is a big dog in a small package. Known for its oversized personality, this breed is alert, curious, and energetic. Brussels Griffons are also sensitive and need almost-constant companionship.","traits-appearance":"Brussels Griffons have short, thick bodies and almost human expressions described as alert and curious. They move with a purposeful (and adorable) trot.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Brussels Griffon can have two distinct coat types: smooth or rough. Rough-coated Brussels Griffons have wiry and dense coats (silky hair is considered a departure from the breed standard). Their rough coats are long but not shaggy and include wiry hair that's slightly longer around the face. The fringe around their faces earned them the nickname \"the bearded dog.\" In contrast, smooth-coated Brussels Griffons have straight, short, tight, and glossy hair.\n\nThe breed comes in four colors: red, belge (a mix of black and reddish brown), black and tan, or solid black.","traits-physical":"Brussels Griffons have large, round skulls with domed foreheads, big black eyes with prominent eyelashes, and small, high set ears.","temperament":"Described as \"full of self-importance,\" the Brussels Griffon is curious and alert. Though this breed is playful and energetic, it also has a sensitive side and prefers mature companions. For this reason, it may not be the best choice for families with small children. When Griffs are around kids, supervision is required to prevent these little dogs from getting hurt.\n\nGriffs are also sensitive about being left alone for too long. They have been called \"Velcro dogs\" and prefer to live with people who are home most of the time (or willing to let them tag along wherever they go).\n\nBrussels Griffons bond with their owners and are known as affectionate, loving dogs but can be nervous around strangers or in new situations. Once they warm up, these small dogs let their big personalities shine. In no time at all, they start working a room, convincing others to adore them.\n\nGriffs aren't aggressive or overly vocal but expect them to bark when someone comes to the door.\n\nThese moderately active dogs require regular exercise to stay happy and healthy.","care-nutrition":"Brussels Griffons require high-quality dog food that's appropriate for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). Consider a food formulated specifically for small breeds. To keep Griffs from packing on the pounds, use a measuring cup to serve the correct portions and limit treats to no more than 10% of their daily calories.","care-grooming":"Smooth-coated Brussels Griffons require less grooming than the rough-coated variety. An occasional bath and weekly brushing are all it takes to remove dirt and excess hair. During shedding season, which happens in the spring and fall, their coats will need daily brushing to remove dead hair.\n\nRough-coated Brussels Griffons also need occasional baths and weekly brushings. However, they also need regular hair trims to keep them looking their best.\n\nNail trims and ear cleaning are also essential grooming tasks.\n\nBrussels Griffons benefit from regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care). Start brushing their teeth at home when they're young and talk to a veterinarian about professional dental cleanings to ensure good oral hygiene throughout their lives.","care-exercise":"The Brussels Griffon is a moderately active breed that requires regular exercise. Whether it's a daily walk or game of fetch in the backyard, Griffs love being active with their owners. Consider activities such as competitive obedience, rally, tracking, or agility. These offer physical and mental stimulation and combine active play with opportunities to bond.","care-training":"Brussels Griffons have two characteristics that make them easy to train: intelligence and strong bonds with their owners. Routine training can ensure that Griffs respond to commands, learn new tricks, and become well-adjusted, confident companions. As with many small breeds, housebreaking can be a challenge.\n\nSince the Brussels Griffon is a sensitive breed, use positive, reward-based training and not harsh reprimands during training sessions. [Early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) can help them feel more confident and overcome their wariness around strangers.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/brussels-griffon/\n\nhttps://abga.club/about-the-breed/","reviewed-by":"Laura Inman, DVM","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":2.7,"weight-range-pet-max":6.4,"weight-range-show-min":2.9,"weight-range-show-max":5.0,"height-range-min":18.0,"height-range-max":20.0,"life-span-range-min":12.0,"life-span-range-max":15.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":71,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":44,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":36},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/06b4156e-744e-55f7-b90a-c01c4c90ec51/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/06b4156e-744e-55f7-b90a-c01c4c90ec51/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/06b4156e-744e-55f7-b90a-c01c4c90ec51/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/06b4156e-744e-55f7-b90a-c01c4c90ec51/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/06b4156e-744e-55f7-b90a-c01c4c90ec51/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/06b4156e-744e-55f7-b90a-c01c4c90ec51/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/06b4156e-744e-55f7-b90a-c01c4c90ec51/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/06b4156e-744e-55f7-b90a-c01c4c90ec51/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/06b4156e-744e-55f7-b90a-c01c4c90ec51/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/06b4156e-744e-55f7-b90a-c01c4c90ec51/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/06b4156e-744e-55f7-b90a-c01c4c90ec51/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/06b4156e-744e-55f7-b90a-c01c4c90ec51/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/06b4156e-744e-55f7-b90a-c01c4c90ec51/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/06b4156e-744e-55f7-b90a-c01c4c90ec51/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/06b4156e-744e-55f7-b90a-c01c4c90ec51/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/06b4156e-744e-55f7-b90a-c01c4c90ec51/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/06b4156e-744e-55f7-b90a-c01c4c90ec51/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/06b4156e-744e-55f7-b90a-c01c4c90ec51/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"06cf13fa-811c-503c-910d-4829673af3bc","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/06cf13fa-811c-503c-910d-4829673af3bc"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"bichon-frise","name":"Bichon Frise","plural-name":"Bichons Frises","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"Belonging to a group of small white dogs called Barbichon (later shortened to Bichon), the Bichon Frise is related to the [Bolognese](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/bolognese), [Havanese](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/havanese), and [Maltese](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/maltese).\n\nThe Bichon Tenerife—a dog popular with sailors on the island of Tenerife—developed into the current Bichon Frise and became the preferred breed of nobles in the 1200s. These dogs served as faithful companions to members of the royal courts across Europe. In France, rumor has it that King Henry III was so enamored with his Bichon that he carried it around in a basket wherever he went. So, it seems fitting that the breed inspired the French word bichonner, meaning \"to make beautiful, to pamper.\"\n\nWhen their wealthy owners got the guillotine during the French Revolution, Bichons lost their place of privilege. Fortunately, the adorable, easily trained little dogs caught the eye of street performers—who taught them tricks to earn the spare change of passersby.\n\nBichon Frises captured hearts and soon transitioned from the streets into loving homes. In 1933, the Societe Centrale Canine in France recognized the breed as the Bichon a Poil Frise. Since then, it has become a popular breed in the non-sporting group, delighting families worldwide.","facts":"Bichon Frise means \"curly lapdog\"—a fitting name for a plush-coated breed that loves to snuggle up to its family. Bichons are famous for their pep, curiosity, charm, and outgoing personalities.","traits-appearance":"The Bichon Frise is a compact, sturdy dog with a merry temperament, plumed tail, and inquisitive expression.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The texture of their hair—often compared to plush or velvet—comes from their soft, dense undercoat and coarse, curlier outer coat. The Bichon Frise's hair is fluffy, giving it a \"powder puff\" appearance. A solid white color is preferred under the breed standard. But shadings of buff, cream, or apricot are possible.","traits-physical":"Bichon Frises are a little longer than they are tall—with compact, medium-boned bodies, and plumed tails. Their round, dark eyes have black or dark brown skin surrounding them, which accentuates their bright and inquisitive expressions.","temperament":"Known for their gentle manners, playful spirits, and unbridled affection, Bichon Frises easily win over people and animals. A cheerful attitude is a hallmark of the breed.\n\nThese active, outgoing dogs make excellent family pets. But like all small breeds, they should be monitored around children to avoid accidental injuries. A sensitive breed, Bichon Frises prefer hugs and kind words to harsh discipline.\n\nApartment living suits the Bichon Frise due to its compact size, minimal exercise needs, and calm demeanor. Just don't leave a Bichon home alone for too long. These small dogs can get into big trouble if they become bored or anxious after long stretches without companionship.\n\nDespite their small size, the Bichons can make excellent, confident watchdogs. But don't expect them to do more than sound the alarm if they sense something is amiss. The breed is far too friendly to be a good protector.","care-nutrition":"Bichon Frises require high-quality dog food that matches their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). Consider a diet specially formulated for small breeds.\n\nTo ensure your Bichon doesn't become overweight, monitor their food intake carefully. Measuring out meals can help avoid accidental overfeeding. And remember that treats should make up no more than 10% of a dog's calories.","care-grooming":"The Bichon Frise is a relatively hypoallergenic breed that sheds very little. Still, these dogs' coats are far from low-maintenance. In addition to daily brushing, they require a bath and professional grooming every month or so to maintain their signature powder puff appearance.\n\nBichon Frises also need regular nail trims and ear cleanings.

The Bichon is relatively active and thrives with regular walks and off-leash play sessions (in secured outdoor areas).\n\nAn outgoing nature makes the Bichon Frise an ideal breed for the dog park or doggie daycare. These intelligent dogs also enjoy learning tricks and perform well in dog sports—such as agility, rally, and competitive obedience.","care-training":"Although the Bichon is intelligent and learns quickly, the breed has a reputation for being difficult to [housebreak](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/potty-train-a-puppy).

While some experts believe that these dogs actually had their start in Europe and became well-known after immigrating to Russia, others believe that the dog was born and bred in Russia and nowhere else. Whatever its origins, the breed was originally used to herd and protect sheep, although it has become more of a household dog over the years. Even though they aren’t predominantly used as sheepdogs anymore, Slovakian Chuvachs still do best in a large area where they can explore and run.","facts":"The South Russian Ovcharka has many desirable traits. They are loyal and active with their people, and they can be great with children. On the other hand, this breed can also bore easily, tends to be independent, and can, if not properly socialized, show aggression towards strangers and other dogs. They tend to be possessive of their food, toys, and bed. Proper training and socialization from a young age is very important for this breed.","traits-appearance":"The South Russian Ovcharka is a large dog with a fuzzy, shaggy appearance.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The South Russian Ovcharka has a furry undercoat with a long topcoat, the texture of which is similar to that of a goat. They are usually white, although it’s not uncommon for them to also have grey, beige, or white with grey marks.","traits-physical":"Of the three Ovcharka breeds, the South Russian Ovcharka’s coat, above, sets it apart from the others.","temperament":"This dog is loyal and energetic, easygoing, and protective of the people they know and love. They are confident and fearless—which can sometimes get them into trouble—but they’re always up for a good time.\n\nOn the other hand, the South Russian Ovcharka’s protective instincts often make them wary of, and sometimes even aggressive towards, other dogs and people that they don’t know. They can become possessive of their things if they aren’t properly trained, and training can sometimes be difficult because they tend to be stubborn and headstrong.\n\nA well-socialized and well-trained South Russian Ovcharka can overcome these traits, but will always have a certain impulse to guard and protect.","care-nutrition":"South Russian Ovcharkas require a high-quality dog food that is age-appropriate—whether it’s commercially manufactured or homemade (with a veterinarian’s supervision and approval). It’s important to monitor the amount of food you give your South Russian Ovcharka. Reduce the portions or restrict calories if your pup gains weight.\n\nYour veterinarian is always a good source to help provide you with appropriate nutrition and feeding guidelines.","care-grooming":"The South Russian Ovcharka has a long coat that’s fairly demanding in terms of maintenance. They shed moderately between their high shedding season (traditionally in the spring), and require daily brushing and combing to keep their fur free of mats. They also have a tendency to get pretty dirty when playing outside, so the occasional bath is necessary.\n\nAll dogs require regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care), including at-home teeth brushing and professional dental cleanings, and the South Russian Ovcharka is no exception. Maintaining good dental hygiene is important for their overall long-term health.","care-exercise":"A proper exercise routine is essential to keep this breed happy, healthy, and behaved. They are a high-energy dog that does best with lots of space to run and play, although it’s important to always keep this breed on a leash or in a fenced-in, secure area. Plan for a little over an hour of daily exercise—including walking or running, throwing a ball, or playing Frisbee—to keep them happy and healthy.","care-training":"The South Russian Ovcharka is known to be stubborn and hardheaded, and they often require professional training. The proper training is essential for this breed, though, since they can be wary and aggressive towards unknown people and animals, and they can bore easily.","care-health":null,"references":"http://aubreyamc.com/canine/south-russian-ovcharka/\n\nhttps://www.southrussianovcharka.com/genhist.html\n\nhttps://wagwalking.com/breed/south-russian-ovcharka","reviewed-by":"Annette

Chongqing Dog","plural-name":"Chinese Chongqing Dogs","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The Chinese Chongqing is an ancient breed from the southwestern part of Sichuan. Clay figurines found in tombs prove they've existed since the Han Dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD). People often refer to the breed by different names, depending on their primary use. For example, bamboo dogs are called Hushan Dogs, cave dogs are called Hechuan Dogs, and hunting dogs are called Linshui Dogs.\n\nBecause this breed evolved in an isolated mountainous region, the Chongqing has developed a personality and appearance that's unique to the region. Wealthy locals use these versatile dogs for guarding, hunting, and companionship. But elsewhere in the world, Chongqing aren't well-known—the breed's considered rare.","facts":"Chinese Chongqing Dogs are intelligent, independent, and brave pups. Loyal to their people, they make dedicated workers and devoted pets.","traits-appearance":"The Chongqing is a medium-sized, muscular dog with a physique similar to an [American Staffordshire Terrier](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/american-staffordshire-terrier).","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Chongqing have short, sleek coats that are a chili pepper red color.","traits-physical":"A broad face, short muzzle, small, triangular upright ears, and thin, muscular tail are some of the Chongqing's key features.","temperament":"The Chinese Chongqing is a noble, fearless breed. These pups are protective of their humans and will not hesitate to defend them if they perceive a threat. For this reason, they do best in homes with experienced pet parents confident in handling such self-appointed bodyguards.\n\nThough independent, Chongqing are playful and like spending time with their people. They also enjoy going on adventures. But you should always leash your dog when in unfenced outdoor areas. Otherwise, their natural desire to hunt may send them after other animals.","care-nutrition":"Chongqings thrive on a high-quality diet formulated for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). Obesity is a growing issue for dogs and can lead to other health conditions. To help your pup maintain a healthy weight, keep an eye on their food intake and measure their portions to avoid overfeeding. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of a dog's calories.","care-grooming":"Chongqings have a low-maintenance coat, typically requiring only a weekly once-over with a brush to remove loose fur and occasional baths. But regular nail trims should also be part of their home care. Nails that get overly long can cause pain and potentially lead to problems running or walking.\n\nNo grooming routine is complete without [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care). Dental disease is one of the most common health conditions in adult dogs. Left untreated, it can contribute to other serious health issues. So, in addition to professional cleanings, establish an at-home dental hygiene program that includes regular teeth brushing and veterinarian-recommended dental chews.","care-exercise":"These active pups need daily exercise to stay physically and mentally healthy. Brisk walks, hikes, and play sessions in a fenced backyard with plenty of space to run around are all great ways to keep Chongqings fit.","care-training":"This intelligent, independent breed responds best to a gentle but firm training approach. Positive reinforcement and consistency are the foundation of a successful training program. Additionally, [socializing your pup] (https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) when they're young will minimize their natural wariness toward strangers and help them grow into a well-mannered adult dog.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.weekinchina.com/2018/02/chinese-dogs-an-overview/\n\nhttps://www.dogbreedinfo.com/chinesechongqingdog.htm\n\nttps://baike.baidu.com/item/%25E9%2587%258D%25E5%25BA%2586%25E7%258A%25AC/4114924","reviewed-by":"Annette Louviere, DVM","date-reviewed":"2021-06-16T16:07:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":15.0,"weight-range-pet-max":25.0,"weight-range-show-min":15.0,"weight-range-show-max":25.0,"height-range-min":35.0,"height-range-max":45.0,"life-span-range-min":10.0,"life-span-range-max":12.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":null,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":null,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":null},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0809347b-7c93-5575-addf-0e5c81b8d58d/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0809347b-7c93-5575-addf-0e5c81b8d58d/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0809347b-7c93-5575-addf-0e5c81b8d58d/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0809347b-7c93-5575-addf-0e5c81b8d58d/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0809347b-7c93-5575-addf-0e5c81b8d58d/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0809347b-7c93-5575-addf-0e5c81b8d58d/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0809347b-7c93-5575-addf-0e5c81b8d58d/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0809347b-7c93-5575-addf-0e5c81b8d58d/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0809347b-7c93-5575-addf-0e5c81b8d58d/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0809347b-7c93-5575-addf-0e5c81b8d58d/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0809347b-7c93-5575-addf-0e5c81b8d58d/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0809347b-7c93-5575-addf-0e5c81b8d58d/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0809347b-7c93-5575-addf-0e5c81b8d58d/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0809347b-7c93-5575-addf-0e5c81b8d58d/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0809347b-7c93-5575-addf-0e5c81b8d58d/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0809347b-7c93-5575-addf-0e5c81b8d58d/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0809347b-7c93-5575-addf-0e5c81b8d58d/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0809347b-7c93-5575-addf-0e5c81b8d58d/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"0888732b-224a-5f4d-9914-3c921e1e5aff","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0888732b-224a-5f4d-9914-3c921e1e5aff"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"norwegian-forest-cat","name":"Norwegian Forest Cat","plural-name":null,"published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"cat","history":"The Norwegian Forest Cat—known in Norway as the Skogkatt—has been featured in local folklore and legends for centuries. Many believe the breed's origins tie back to European shorthair cats brought to Norway by the Romans. Over time, these early ancestors evolved into sturdy, thick-coated cats capable of surviving harsh Scandanavian winters. For a time, they also provided reliable pest control on Viking ships.\n\nIn the early 1900s, cross-breeding with local domestic shorthairs in Norway threatened the Norwegian Forest Cat's existence as a distinct breed. In response, cat fanciers vowed to preserve the breed. But World War II put their plans on hold. It wasn't until the 1970s that Norwegians developed an official breeding program and the breed began appearing in European cat shows.\n\nThe first pair of Norwegian Forest Cats arrived in the United States in 1979, kicking off the North American breeding program. In 1993, the Cat Fanciers Association granted the breed Championship status.\n\nNorwegian Forest Cats remain very popular in Norway and northern Europe. Though they are rarer in North America, they have a loyal following of people who adore their beloved \"Wegies.\"","facts":"Mild-mannered and patient, Norwegian Forest Cats love being part of a family. They're a relatively low-maintenance breed with a gentle nature and strong nurturing instinct.","traits-appearance":"Norwegian Forest Cats are large cats that can take up to five years to reach their full growth potential. Their bodies are sturdy, well-balanced, and muscular.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"A thick double coat comprised of a dense undercoat and long, glossy, water-resistant topcoat is a distinguishing feature of the breed. The hair forms a thick ruff, mutton chops, and full britches.\n\nNorwegian Forest Cats come in most colors and patterns—including white, black, blue, silver, tortoiseshell, bi-color, calico, and tabby. However, their coats do not come in color-point colors, such as seal point or chocolate point. Their eyes are typically shades of green, gold, or copper. Cats with white hair may have blue or odd eyes (one blue and one other color).","traits-physical":"Norwegian Forest Cats have triangular heads and thick, well-muscled necks. Their ears are medium-to-large and heavily furnished. Large, almond-shaped eyes offer an alert expression. They have a strong appearance, with a broad chest, powerful legs, and a long, bushy tail.","temperament":"Norwegian Forest Cats have a friendly disposition and easy-going nature. They are an adaptable breed that does great with dogs and other pets, as well as kids.\n\nThese athletic cats prefer to view the world from a high perch. Tall cat trees are a must to satisfy their curious nature. Toys—particularly those they can chase—will also keep them busy and bring out their playful side.\n\nNorwegian Forest Cats like to stay near their people (but not too close). They frequently follow family members around and enjoy keeping tabs on what everyone is doing. Though they appreciate the company of others, they're more likely to lounge on the back of the couch than on someone's lap. They may curl up for a snuggle, but they decide when (and for how long).","care-nutrition":"Norwegian Forest Cats require a high-quality diet. Because nutritional needs vary for kittens, adults, and senior cats, opt for a formula that's age-appropriate for your pet.\n\nTo keep your cat at a healthy weight, monitor their food intake and reduce portions if necessary. And don't forget to count treats, which should make up no more than 10% of a cat's daily calories.\n\nFinally, access to fresh, clean water around the clock is essential.","care-grooming":"For most of the year, Norwegian Forest Cats shed very little. But they do require weekly brushing to prevent their hair from tangling. Once or twice a year, they molt and lose their thick double coats. During these periods, daily brushing helps remove loose fur and prevent matting.\n\nRoutine nail clipping can keep your cat's claws from growing too long, snagging on something, and becoming torn or damaged. Overgrown nails can also grow into their paw pads, leading to pain or infection. In addition to clipping, providing a scratching post will help keep their nails in good shape and satisfy their instinct to scratch.\n\nDental hygiene is another key component of any cat's care. The sooner you start your Norwegian Forest Cat on a routine that includes at-home teeth brushing, the better. They should also regularly see a veterinarian for exams and professional cleanings.","care-exercise":null,"care-training":null,"care-health":"All cats carry some risk for developing genetic health conditions. In particular, Norwegian Forest Cats may have an increased risk for developing Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy. This condition decreases the heart's efficiency and can lead to other issues.

Known as Chien Berger de Brie in their homeland, these active, agile dogs were used to both herd sheep and guard the flocks. Their skill made the Briard so popular that it became somewhat of an institution in France.\n\nThe Briard was named the official war dog of the French army. During World War I, Briards served in the trenches, performing sentry duty, finding wounded soldiers, and pulling carts full of supplies.\n\nOnce a breed belonging to French farmers and peasants, the Briard got a boost from several high-profile owners. Napoleon owned a Briard and Thomas Jefferson purchased a pregnant Briard during his tenure as the ambassador to France. Upon his return to the United States, Jefferson put the dog to work at Monticello—but she was more than a working dog; she helped establish the breed outside of Europe.","facts":"Briards are confident, faithful dogs that are ideal for families. The same protective instinct that allowed Briards to guard livestock for centuries extends to children, whom the dogs see as their flock.","traits-appearance":"The Briard is considered a “handsome” dog with strong bones and muscles and confident gaze.\n\nThe breed is powerful without being coarse and moves with a supple, light gait that gives it the appearance of gliding without touching the ground.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Briards have double coats. Their undercoats are fine and tight across their bodies, and their outercoats are coarse and hard; the outer coat lies flat, falling naturally in long, slightly waving locks that can grow to more than six inches in length. Their heads are well covered with hair that lies down and has a natural part in the center, while their eyebrows arch up and out in a curve that creates a veil over their eyes.\n\nThe breed standard allows for Briards in all uniform coat colors except white. The most common colors include black, gray, and tawny. All shades are allowed but deeper shades of each color are preferred; combinations of two of these colors are also allowed.","traits-physical":"Briards are strong in muscle and bone with broad, deep chests and powerful forequarters and hindquarters that move with flexible, tireless movements. These dogs have uncut, well-feathered tails that are carried low but do not deviate to the right or left; high-set ears that face forward when alert and are well open with long hair falling over the opening; and large, well-opened, and calm eyes.","temperament":"Like other herding and guardian breeds, the Briard is fearless, never timid. These dogs excel in their work thanks to their high spirits, initiative, and stamina but also have the faithful, gentle, obedient natures that make them ideal as companions.\n\nBriards are great with children, looking out for them like members of the flock, and shows great love and loyalty to their owners. These are active dogs and can easily overwhelm novice dog owners or those unprepared to meet their exercise needs.\n\nThe breed also retains its ancestral instinct to guard its home, including its owners. Socialization can help Briards feel more comfortable with strangers and ease their territorial natures.","care-nutrition":"Feed Briards a high-quality dog food that is appropriate for their life stage (puppy, adult, senior) and consider a diet formulated for active breeds. Like all dogs, Briards could become overweight if they are allowed to eat as much as they want. Portioning out their food with a measuring cup and limiting treats to no more than 10% of their daily calories can help keep these dogs fit and trim.","care-grooming":"Briards need to be brushed at least once per week to remove dead hair and prevent tangles. Their long double coats require daily brushing during spring and fall. An undercoat rake can help reduce shedding. Keep their ears clean and their nails trimmed.\n\nBriards also benefit from a regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) routine that includes at-home teeth brushing and professional cleanings.","care-exercise":"Briards are working dogs that require lots of exercise. These dogs love brisk walks, hiking, and tagging along on bike rides. A large fenced area where Briards can play off leash will also help burn off some of their abundant energy. Briards also excel in dog sports such as competitive obedience, agility, tracking, flyball, rally, and herding.\n\nRegular socialization, starting when Briards are puppies, will help them feel more comfortable with strangers.","care-training":"Briards were bred to work solo, making decisions without specific commands from their owners; it is a trait the breed has carried through history and can make them difficult to train. These dogs are smart and can learn new things easily but may choose to ignore commands.\n\nAppeal to the Briard’s eager-to-please natures with positive reinforcement and rewards-based training. A training regimen that is consistent and fast-paced will appeal to the energetic working dogs and help channel their energy in positive directions.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/briard/\n\nhttp://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/Briard.pdf","reviewed-by":"Laura Inman, DVM","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":21.8,"weight-range-pet-max":44.0,"weight-range-show-min":22.7,"weight-range-show-max":39.9,"height-range-min":56.0,"height-range-max":69.0,"life-span-range-min":10.0,"life-span-range-max":12.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":101,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":65,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":43},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/099e8da5-61aa-59b8-a7a7-7850af467df4/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/099e8da5-61aa-59b8-a7a7-7850af467df4/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/099e8da5-61aa-59b8-a7a7-7850af467df4/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/099e8da5-61aa-59b8-a7a7-7850af467df4/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/099e8da5-61aa-59b8-a7a7-7850af467df4/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/099e8da5-61aa-59b8-a7a7-7850af467df4/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/099e8da5-61aa-59b8-a7a7-7850af467df4/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/099e8da5-61aa-59b8-a7a7-7850af467df4/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/099e8da5-61aa-59b8-a7a7-7850af467df4/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/099e8da5-61aa-59b8-a7a7-7850af467df4/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/099e8da5-61aa-59b8-a7a7-7850af467df4/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/099e8da5-61aa-59b8-a7a7-7850af467df4/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/099e8da5-61aa-59b8-a7a7-7850af467df4/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/099e8da5-61aa-59b8-a7a7-7850af467df4/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/099e8da5-61aa-59b8-a7a7-7850af467df4/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/099e8da5-61aa-59b8-a7a7-7850af467df4/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/099e8da5-61aa-59b8-a7a7-7850af467df4/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/099e8da5-61aa-59b8-a7a7-7850af467df4/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"0a1dd909-dd82-5c68-bbb6-a8347e9faab5","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0a1dd909-dd82-5c68-bbb6-a8347e9faab5"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"thai-ridgeback","name":"Thai Ridgeback","plural-name":"Thai Ridgebacks","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"As you might expect, the Thai Ridgeback comes from Thailand. Historical documents from the 1600s refer to the breed, which likely descended from the Funan Ridgeback Dog (whose own origins date back more than 1,000 years). These dogs hunted all kinds of animals, from small mammals to venomous cobras.\n\nDue to the relative isolation and limited transportation in their native region of eastern Thailand, Thai Ridgebacks had few chances to mate. As a result, the breed's bloodline remained fairly pure. Today, it's uncommon to see the Thai Ridgeback outside of Thailand—where it's still considered a primitive breed.","facts":"The Thai Ridgeback is a muscular, athletic dog best known for its strong guarding and predatory instincts. Experienced owners who prioritize training and socialization can help these independent dogs become loving, loyal family pets.","traits-appearance":"Thai Ridgebacks have a lean, muscular build. As hounds, they are natural athletes. Their bodies are longer than they are tall. And they have wedge-shaped heads, long, straight noses, strong jaws, upright ears, and thick tails the slightly curve toward the tips. The breed's forehead wrinkles, especially when the dog is attentive.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Thai Ridgeback's short, smooth coat comes in solid colors—such as red, black, blue-gray, or light fawn (called Isabella). Some dogs have red or fawn coloring with black masks. Brindle and white coats are also possible but not considered acceptable by breed standards. The Thai Ridgeback's name comes from a strip of hair down the center of the back. This strip grows in a direction opposite of the rest of the coat, creating a pronounced ridge.","traits-physical":"Thai Ridgebacks can have eight distinctive ridge patterns: needle, feather, arrow, lute, violin, bowling pin, leaf, and saddleback. All are allowed in the breed standard as long as the ridge is symmetrical and clearly defined. Puppies are sometimes born without the ridge, and it develops over time.\n\nThis breed can also have a spotted tongue (of blue/black pigmentation), and dogs from Northern Thailand often have dew claws on their back feet.","temperament":"Harsh conditions in Thailand forced this breed to hunt for food, resulting in strong survival instincts. Though most owners keep Thai Ridgebacks as companion animals, they retain an independent, self-sufficient nature.\n\nHunters at heart, Thai Ridgebacks often stalk or chase smaller animals and may be aggressive toward other dogs. They aren't overly affectionate, but they do bond with their owners and seek to protect them. For this reason, they tend to be reserved and suspicious around strangers and unfamiliar animals.\n\nThese strong-willed dogs do best in homes with patient, experienced pet parents who understand canine behavior. Thai Ridgebacks aren't a great fit for families with small children.","care-nutrition":"These active dogs need a high-quality dog food that is appropriate for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). Measuring out portions can prevent overfeeding, and limiting treats will help your dog retain their athletic build.","care-grooming":"Thai Ridgebacks have short coats that require minimal care. Occasional brushing and baths will remove loose hair and keep these pups looking good. With no undercoat and minimal shedding, this breed produces less dander, making it suitable for people with allergies.\n\nThai Ridgebacks have strong, fast-growing nails that need to be trimmed regularly to keep them from cracking, splitting, or becoming overgrown and painful. And an at-home [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) routine—along with professional cleanings—is essential to the overall health of your dog.","care-exercise":"These active, athletic dogs require a lot of exercise. Plan on several brisk on-leash walks (or runs) every day. Games like fetch and hide-and-seek can also help satisfy your Thai Ridgeback's need to move.\n\nThis breed may also enjoy swimming, hiking, and dog sports—such as agility, rally, lure coursing, and obedience. But due to their strong prey drive, Thai Ridgebacks should only be allowed off-leash in securely fenced areas. And keep in mind, they aren't great candidates for dog parks or other group play settings.","care-training":"The Thai Ridgeback's independent, self-sufficient nature can make the breed hard to train. Even experienced owners well-versed in dog behavior must work hard to get Thai Ridgebacks to obey.\n\nA combination of positive reinforcement, reward-based training, and firm correction is usually the best approach. [Early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) is also essential, as it will help this breed be more comfortable around strangers.","care-health":null,"references":"http://www.thaidog.org/faq.html\n\nhttp://www.fci.be/Nomenclature/Standards/338g05-en.pdf\n\nhttps://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/thai-ridgeback/","reviewed-by":"Annette Louviere, DVM","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":15.9,"weight-range-pet-max":34.0,"weight-range-show-min":15.9,"weight-range-show-max":34.0,"height-range-min":51.0,"height-range-max":61.0,"life-span-range-min":12.0,"life-span-range-max":14.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":92,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":55,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":37},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0a1dd909-dd82-5c68-bbb6-a8347e9faab5/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0a1dd909-dd82-5c68-bbb6-a8347e9faab5/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0a1dd909-dd82-5c68-bbb6-a8347e9faab5/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0a1dd909-dd82-5c68-bbb6-a8347e9faab5/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0a1dd909-dd82-5c68-bbb6-a8347e9faab5/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0a1dd909-dd82-5c68-bbb6-a8347e9faab5/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0a1dd909-dd82-5c68-bbb6-a8347e9faab5/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0a1dd909-dd82-5c68-bbb6-a8347e9faab5/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0a1dd909-dd82-5c68-bbb6-a8347e9faab5/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0a1dd909-dd82-5c68-bbb6-a8347e9faab5/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0a1dd909-dd82-5c68-bbb6-a8347e9faab5/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0a1dd909-dd82-5c68-bbb6-a8347e9faab5/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0a1dd909-dd82-5c68-bbb6-a8347e9faab5/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0a1dd909-dd82-5c68-bbb6-a8347e9faab5/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0a1dd909-dd82-5c68-bbb6-a8347e9faab5/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0a1dd909-dd82-5c68-bbb6-a8347e9faab5/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0a1dd909-dd82-5c68-bbb6-a8347e9faab5/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0a1dd909-dd82-5c68-bbb6-a8347e9faab5/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"0a82a474-4ee6-59b9-984a-7ed5c5c4e319","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0a82a474-4ee6-59b9-984a-7ed5c5c4e319"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"golden-retriever","name":"Golden Retriever","plural-name":"Golden Retrievers","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"Golden Retrievers can trace their origins back to 19-century Scotland. They were bred as hunting dogs and used to locate and retrieve game from land and water.\n\nSir Dudley Majoribanks, Lord of Tweedmouth, conducted the initial efforts to breed the Golden Retriever. He kept detailed records of breedings between 1840 and 1890. His goal was to create a dog that could handle the rainy weather and rugged terrain of the Scottish Highlands. He began with a yellow dog from Brighton and an English retriever with a liver-colored curly coat called a Tweed Water Spaniel, now extinct.\n\nHe later introduced Labrador Retrievers, Newfoundlands, Red Setters, and Bloodhounds into the mix. The Kennel Club of England accepted the breed in 1903 as the \"Golden Flat Coat.\" It was the first breed to be shown in an English dog show in 1908.\n\nThe breed was introduced to the United States in the late 1890s, and it received the name \"Golden Retriever\" in 1920. The American Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1932.\n\nToday, Golden Retrievers are among the most popular family dogs, thanks to their compatibility with other dogs and people. They are great members of the family, and they excel as both guide and assistance dogs and search and rescue dogs.","facts":"The Golden Retriever is an intelligent breed that excels in a wide range of duties and activities. In fact, it's one of the most versatile dog breeds in the world. Golden Retrievers are active, loving, and eager to please. They also have a very gentle temperament. Given all this, it's no surprise that they're among the most popular dogs in the U.S.","traits-appearance":"Golden Retrievers are symmetrical, powerful, balanced dogs. Their eyes offer a friendly, intelligent expression.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Golden Retriever's coat is dense enough to be textured, though it's neither short nor especially long. They also have a water-resistant undercoat.\n\nAs the name suggests, the breed is generally a rich golden color, ranging from a light gold to a darker reddish gold. The coat and tail are feathered with paler creams, though the dog is never white.","traits-physical":"Golden Retrievers have strong, well-balanced bodies and short coupling (meaning, the space between their last rib and their pelvis is relatively short).\n\nTheir eyes are medium-large with dark, close-fitting rims, set well apart. The preferred color is dark brown, though some have medium-brown eyes. The Golden Retriever's tail is thick and muscular at the base. It's carried level, or with a slight upward curve.","temperament":"Golden Retrievers are one of the best breeds for families. They're devoted and affectionate to their people, and love being involved in all family activities.\n\nThey're generally happy-go-lucky dogs, and many maintain their puppy-like attitudes into adulthood. Though typically a calm, easy-going breed, Goldens can sometimes be energetic or nervous.\n\nTheir friendly nature makes them poor watchdogs, but they make excellent pets and wonderful aids for the elderly and disabled. They're playful and trustworthy with children, and typically get along with other pets and dogs.\n\nGolden Retrievers need ample attention and human companionship, as well as regular exercise. Due to their retriever instincts, they'll try to carry just about anything they can get into their mouths. For them, retrieving is a favorite pastime. So, the way to a Golden Retriever's heart may just be through a game of fetch.","care-nutrition":"To meet a Golden Retriever's nutritional needs, you should feed a high-quality food that's appropriate for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior.) They will benefit from diets formulated for large-breed dogs. In particular, large-breed puppy diets keep them from growing too fast, which may decrease the incidence or severity of hip dysplasia as they age.\n\nGolden Retrievers are prone to gaining weight. To prevent obesity, you should closely monitor their food intake. Avoid accidental overfeeding by measuring out their portions using a standard measuring cup, and be sure to account for treats when calculating their daily calorie intake. As a general guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of their daily calories.","care-grooming":"Golden Retrievers need to be brushed about two times a week. Twice a year, they shed their thick undercoats. During these periods, you will likely need to brush more frequently.\n\nTrimming nails, cleaning ears, and [brushing teeth](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) should also be part of every dog's grooming routine, regardless of breed.","care-exercise":"To maintain their calm demeanors, Golden Retrievers need plenty of daily exercise. And they enjoy many activities, including jogging, fetch, and trips to the dog park.\n\nGolden Retrievers also enjoy dog sports—such as hunting, tracking, and agility. They love to swim, as well. For a fun game that takes advantage of their natural swimming ability and affinity for water, try playing fetch with floating toys.\n\nIt's also important for Golden Retrievers to exercise their minds. Achieve this by giving them puzzle toys or [practicing obedience](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-obedience-training) commands with them.","care-training":"Golden Retrievers are eager to please, which makes them fairly easy to train if you use gentle but firm techniques. They're also very food-motivated. This may make it easier to teach them to drop retrieved items not intended for play (such as one of your favorite shoes.)","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/golden-retriever/\n\nhttp://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/GoldenRetriever.pdf\n\nhttps://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/dog-breeds/golden-retriever","reviewed-by":"Laura Inman, DVM","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":20.9,"weight-range-pet-max":36.3,"weight-range-show-min":24.9,"weight-range-show-max":31.8,"height-range-min":51.0,"height-range-max":61.0,"life-span-range-min":10.0,"life-span-range-max":12.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":101,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":65,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":43},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0a82a474-4ee6-59b9-984a-7ed5c5c4e319/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0a82a474-4ee6-59b9-984a-7ed5c5c4e319/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0a82a474-4ee6-59b9-984a-7ed5c5c4e319/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0a82a474-4ee6-59b9-984a-7ed5c5c4e319/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0a82a474-4ee6-59b9-984a-7ed5c5c4e319/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0a82a474-4ee6-59b9-984a-7ed5c5c4e319/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0a82a474-4ee6-59b9-984a-7ed5c5c4e319/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0a82a474-4ee6-59b9-984a-7ed5c5c4e319/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0a82a474-4ee6-59b9-984a-7ed5c5c4e319/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0a82a474-4ee6-59b9-984a-7ed5c5c4e319/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0a82a474-4ee6-59b9-984a-7ed5c5c4e319/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0a82a474-4ee6-59b9-984a-7ed5c5c4e319/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0a82a474-4ee6-59b9-984a-7ed5c5c4e319/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0a82a474-4ee6-59b9-984a-7ed5c5c4e319/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0a82a474-4ee6-59b9-984a-7ed5c5c4e319/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0a82a474-4ee6-59b9-984a-7ed5c5c4e319/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0a82a474-4ee6-59b9-984a-7ed5c5c4e319/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0a82a474-4ee6-59b9-984a-7ed5c5c4e319/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"0af30ef4-256a-5404-abfd-6c92b3a2a3c0","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0af30ef4-256a-5404-abfd-6c92b3a2a3c0"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"bruno-saint-hubert-francais","name":"Bruno Saint-Hubert Français","plural-name":"Brunos Saint-Hubert Françaises","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The Bruno Saint-Hubert Français is one of four varieties of Swiss Hound.

Weekly brushing to remove loose fur and the occasional bath are usually all it takes to keep these dogs looking their best.\n\nTheir long ears can be prone to ear infections. So, check them regularly and wipe out any wax build-up or debris you find. Regular nail trims should also be part of any dog's grooming routine. Nails that get too long can cause pain and potentially lead to problems running or walking.\n\nLast but not least, aim to establish good [dental hygiene](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) habits.

Mudi is a Hungarian working dog with similar origins to the Pumi and Puli. As one of the small sheepdog breeds that appeared around the ninth century, the Mudi herded flocks of sheep and cattle, exterminated vermin, and guarded the house.\n\nThe Mudi didn't become a distinct breed until 1930 when a local museum director, Deszö Fényesi, started a breeding program. His efforts led to the Mudi earning recognition as a breed in 1936.\n\nAlthough the Mudi remains a popular herding breed in Hungary, where it works alongside shepherds to move flocks with up to 500 sheep, it's rare outside of its native country.","facts":"Bred as an all-purpose farm dog, the Mudi is a courageous, agile, alert working dog and protector. It's a rare breed seldom seen outside of its native Hungary.","traits-appearance":"The Mudi is an agile, medium-sized dog with almost square proportions. Alert and surefooted, it moves with a free, tireless gait and is capable of quick and sudden movements.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Mudi has short, straight, smooth hair on its face and the front of its legs. On its body, the hair is dense and wavy to curly, between one and three inches long on other parts of its body with pronounced feathering on the back of the forearms and upper thighs. The hair is known to form cowlicks and ridges, giving the coat a curled appearance.\n\nThe Mudi comes in five colors: black (all over with no shading); brown with colors ranging from light brown to chocolate; gray (all over with no shading); gray-brown; or yellow and white with colors ranging from almost white to darker golden shades. The merle pattern is allowed with any color.","traits-physical":"The Mudi has a muscular, tight build with a short, straight, taut back, powerful hindquarters, and a full length or natural stump tail. Their almond-shaped eyes curve up at the outer edges, giving the Mudi a daredevil expression.\n\nThe color of their eyes depends on their coat color. Merle-patterned dogs have brown, blue, or brown speckled with blue eyes; brown, gray, or gray-brown dogs have lighter brown eyes; and yellow and white dogs have dark brown, lighter brown, blue or brown speckled with blue eyes.","temperament":"These working dogs are alert, energetic, and enthusiastic about completing tasks. A strong drive to work can make the Mudi a challenge for novice dog owners. The breed is best suited to those who can provide strong leadership, consistent training, and a lot of exercise—preferably in the form of a job.\n\nThe Mudi makes an excellent watchdog. They are loyal protectors of their properties and their families, and somewhat suspicious of strangers without being overly aggressive. These dogs can also be vocal and may not be the best choice for apartment life.","care-nutrition":"Feed the Mudi a high-quality dog food that is appropriate for their life stage (puppy, adult, senior) and consider a diet formulated for active breeds. Portion out their food with a measuring cup and limit treats to no more than 10 percent of their daily calories to avoid overfeeding.","care-grooming":"When it comes to grooming, the Mudi is low maintenance: an occasional bath and brushing to keep them clean and remove dead hair is all it takes to keep these dogs looking their best.\n\nThe Mudi also requires regular ear cleanings, nail trims, and a [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) routine that includes at-home teeth brushing and professional cleanings.","care-exercise":"These are energetic working dogs that require lots of exercise. In the absence of farming work, the Mudi makes a great running companion and also enjoys brisk walks, hiking, and swimming.\n\nThese highly intelligent dogs also excel in dog sports such as agility, flyball, obedience, and herding.

These dogs played a key role in Norway's northern coastal economy. They had physical adaptations—such as six toes and an \"elastic\" neck—that helped them hunt puffins among the steep cliffs in the area. For this reason, Norwegian Lundehunds were quite valuable, and people usually kept many of them.\n\nBut when the Norwegian government created taxes on the dogs and puffins became endangered, that all changed. Fortunately, the communities of Værøy and Lovunden offered seclusion and protection that saved the breed from extinction. A woman named Eleanor Christie then started building back the Norwegian Lundehund's numbers. And eventually, a Swedish geneticist created a strict breeding plan, which the Norsk Lundehund Klubb Breeding Council adopted. Norweigian breeders still follow his guidelines this day.","facts":"At first glance, the Norwegian Lundehund may seem like an average dog. But many unique characteristics (such as six-toed feet!) set this breed apart. Originally developed to hunt puffin on the rocky island of Vaeroy, Norwegian Lundehunds also make loyal, playful family companions.","traits-appearance":"This small, rectangular Spitz breed seems average at first glance. They have a wedge-shaped head with medium-sized, triangular ears and a level back with a tail that hangs at a slight curve when it’s at rest.  But, there’s a lot more to the Norwegian Lundehund than initially meets the eye.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Norwegian Lundehund has a durable and dense outer coat with a softer undercoat. Their colorings are typically fallow to reddish-brown or tan, with black hair tips and white markings, or white with red markings. As they mature, they develop more black hair tips.","traits-physical":"Though the Norwegian Lundehund resembles a typical Spitz, they have quite a few unique physical traits that helped them scale Norwegian cliffs.\n\nThe first unique characteristic of the Norwegian Lundehund is that they have a minimum of six toes on each foot, as well as elongated rear footpads. Their neck is also what’s referred to as “elastic,” which means that their head can bend completely backward to touch their spine.\n\nTheir shoulders are also incredibly flexible and allow their front legs to extend flat to the side (necessarily and helpful when scaling cliffs), and their ears can close and fold forward or backward to protect from dirt.","temperament":"This breed is alert, active, loyal, and protective. Although they can sometimes be wary of new people, they aren’t overly aggressive or shy.","care-nutrition":"Feed your Norwegian Lundehund a high-quality dog food suited to their particular age, activity level, and size, as well as any additional health concerns.\n\nAs with any dog, it’s essential to monitor the amount of food and treats you give your Norwegian Lundehund to avoid having them gain weight, especially as they age. Your veterinarian is always a good source to help provide you with appropriate nutrition and feeding guidelines.","care-grooming":"The Norwegian Lundehund’s low-maintenance double coat requires only weekly brushing to help remove loose hair.\n\nAll dogs require regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care), including at-home teeth brushing and professional dental cleanings. And the Norwegian Lundehund is no exception. Maintaining good dental hygiene is important for their overall long-term health.","care-exercise":"This high-energy dog requires daily activity to stay stimulated and healthy. Luckily, they enjoy many companion activities, so a nice walk around the block or game of fetch will keep them happy.","care-training":"The Norwegian Lundehund is smart, loyal, and can be easy to train.\n\nBut remember, this breed can be sensitive, and they don’t react well to harsh training methods or a strong hand. Be patient and affectionate, and your training sessions will succeed.","care-health":null,"references":"https://nlaainc.com/about/history/\n\nhttps://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/norwegian-lundehund/\n\nhttp://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/NorwegianLundehund.pdf","reviewed-by":"Laura

Army developed during the 1940s. Intended to be part of the Russian military forces, this breed needed to be large, strong, high-spirited, capable, and trainable. It also had to be able to endure harsh Russian winters.\n\nUnder the direction of Colonel G. Medvedev, breeders created the Black Russian Terrier by crossing [Airedales](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/airedale-terrier), [Giant Schnauzers](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/schnauzer-giant), [Rottweilers](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/rottweiler), and 14 other breeds.\n\nThe popularity of the Black Russian Terrier has since spread throughout the Soviet Union, Europe, and the United States. The American Kennel Club officially recognized the breed in 2004.","facts":"Black Russian Terriers are intelligent, good-tempered, and extremely reliable dogs. They make top-notch guard dogs because they're loyal to family, protective of their territory, and suspicious of strangers.","traits-appearance":"Big and brawny, Black Russian Terriers emanate strength, power, and agility.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Black Russian Terrier has a tousled double coat that is coal-black, with or without a scattering of gray hair.","traits-physical":"When you take a close look at the Black Russian Terrier, you'll notice a muscular body structure, large head, thick neck, and prominent chest.","temperament":"Black Russian Terriers are calm and self-assured. They may seem aloof around strangers. And though they're generally good with other pets, Black Russian Terriers can sometimes be reactive toward other dogs.\n\nIn addition to being smart, curious, and playful, Black Russian Terriers are courageous and prepared to protect their home, territory, and family.","care-nutrition":"Black Russian Terriers require a high-quality dog food that is age-appropriate—whether it's commercially manufactured or homemade (under a veterinarian's supervision and approval).\n\nAs you should with any dog, keep an eye on the amount of food you give your Black Russian Terrier and reduce the portions if your pup gains weight. Also, remember that giving too many treats can contribute to obesity.","care-grooming":"This breed's dense undercoat is covered by a thick, protective outer coat. As such, the Black Russian Terrier needs regular grooming with meticulous brushing once or twice a week to prevent matting.","care-exercise":"Whether it's a fast-paced walk, a long run, or hiking adventure, Black Russian Terriers enjoys all types of physical exercise. And they need it, too, thriving with a minimum of 30–45 minutes of daily exercise. Without enough physical activity or sufficient family time, they may become unhappy, destructive dogs.\n\nBlack Russian Terriers typically excel in many canine sports. These include rally obedience, agility, lure coursing, dock diving, cart pulling, K-9 nose work, tracking, and more.","care-training":"Black Russian Terriers respond well to [reward-based training techniques](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-obedience-training) (never punishment-based) using treats and favorite toys.\n\nTo thwart aggressive behaviors in an adult Black Russian Terrier, you must start [socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) and obedience training during puppyhood and continue throughout the dog's life.

Though they have a tendency to bark, Drevers are social animals and tend to get along with other dogs.","traits-appearance":"The short-statured, agile Drever has a long, sturdy body and well-developed muscles.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Drevers have short, coarse hair that comes in a variety of colors—including tri-color, red and white, and fawn and white.","traits-physical":"With a long, low body and short legs, the Drever is muscular and agile—ready to take on any hunting challenge.","temperament":"Highly skilled hunters, Drevers also make great family dogs when properly trained. They typically have an alert disposition and a strong love for their people.\n\nLike most hunting dogs, the Drever can sometimes be stubborn. Starting training early can help temper this independent streak. Overall, Drevers are even-tempered and don't tend to be overly aggressive or shy.","care-nutrition":"It's important to feed your Drever a high-quality dog food suited to their particular age and activity level—as well as any additional health concerns.\n\nDrevers are prone to gaining excess weight as they age. To prevent this, monitor how much your dog eats and reduce portions if necessary. Your veterinarian can also advise on appropriate nutrition and feeding guidelines.","care-grooming":"Drevers are relatively low-maintenance—especially when it comes to grooming. Though their coarse hair does shed, a weekly brushing session and the occasional bath is all they need to stay looking good.\n\nTrimming nails, cleaning ears, and [brushing teeth](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) should also be part of every dog's grooming routine, regardless of breed.","care-exercise":"Though Drevers may differ from traditional hunting dogs in terms of size, they certainly compare in stamina. An active and energetic breed, the Drever requires stimulating activity and exercise every day to stay healthy and happy.\n\nThese dogs love spending time with their people. So, group activities—such as walking and hiking—are good options. Drevers also seem to enjoy canine sports, such as rally, agility and lure coursing.","care-training":"Drevers have a stubborn streak that can make them difficult to train. But since their strong prey drive can get the best of them, proper training from an early age is essential.\n\nFor the best results, use reward-based training techniques. And remember, [all dogs need socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) to become safe, well-adjusted companions. (This is especially true for hunting breeds.)","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/drever/\n\nhttp://www.fci.be/Nomenclature/Standards/130g06-en.pdf","reviewed-by":"Laura Inman, DVM","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":14.1,"weight-range-pet-max":15.9,"weight-range-show-min":14.1,"weight-range-show-max":15.9,"height-range-min":30.0,"height-range-max":38.0,"life-span-range-min":12.0,"life-span-range-max":14.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":97,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":57,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":41},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0e924dcb-6fe5-5411-a067-11ced25690ef/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0e924dcb-6fe5-5411-a067-11ced25690ef/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0e924dcb-6fe5-5411-a067-11ced25690ef/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0e924dcb-6fe5-5411-a067-11ced25690ef/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0e924dcb-6fe5-5411-a067-11ced25690ef/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0e924dcb-6fe5-5411-a067-11ced25690ef/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0e924dcb-6fe5-5411-a067-11ced25690ef/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0e924dcb-6fe5-5411-a067-11ced25690ef/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0e924dcb-6fe5-5411-a067-11ced25690ef/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0e924dcb-6fe5-5411-a067-11ced25690ef/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0e924dcb-6fe5-5411-a067-11ced25690ef/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0e924dcb-6fe5-5411-a067-11ced25690ef/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0e924dcb-6fe5-5411-a067-11ced25690ef/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0e924dcb-6fe5-5411-a067-11ced25690ef/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0e924dcb-6fe5-5411-a067-11ced25690ef/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0e924dcb-6fe5-5411-a067-11ced25690ef/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0e924dcb-6fe5-5411-a067-11ced25690ef/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0e924dcb-6fe5-5411-a067-11ced25690ef/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"0e9f0151-eb46-5ef8-b042-5144cbfa3004","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0e9f0151-eb46-5ef8-b042-5144cbfa3004"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":false,"reported-uk":false,"reported-gb":false,"reported-us":false,"country-codes":[],"slug":"xarnego-podenco-valenciano","name":"Xarnego -

And during the transatlantic passage, the dogs earned their keep by killing rats and entertaining the crew.\n\nThis fabulous looking terrier owes its name and popularity to Sir Walter Scott. In his novel Guy Mannering, a character named Dandie Dinmont owns a pack of terriers.","facts":"The Dandie Dinmont Terrier is a fun-loving and lively breed—and the only one to be named after a fictional character. Though small in size, the dog boasts a big personality. Dandie Dinmonts enjoy the company of kids, making them wonderful family pets.","traits-appearance":"A hardy breed, the Dandie Dinmont has short legs and an elongated body.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Dandie Dinmont dons a coat that comes two colors: \"bluish black to silvery gray, and reddish-brown to pale fawn.\"","traits-physical":"Large heads covered, smooth white hair, long pendulous ears, and bright eyes are all signature characteristics of Dandie Dinmonts.","temperament":"Though the Dandie Dinmont Terrier is a tough little canine, it's usually friendly and suitable for older children. But the breed may be reserved around strangers and might not get along with other dogs.\n\nDandie Dinmont Terriers are known to be active, independent, intelligent dogs. Because they were bred to hunt, they have a tendency to chase what they consider prey.\n\nAs a terrier, the Dandie Dinmont typically has a stubborn, daring personality. But this \"gentleman of terriers\" is prized for its kind, affectionate character.","care-nutrition":"Dandie Dinmont Terriers need a high-quality dog food formulated for their age. It's also important to monitor the amount of food your Dandie Dinmont eats and reduce the portions if your pup gains weight. Remember that giving too many treats can contribute to obesity.","care-grooming":"Interestingly, Dandie Dinmont Terriers don't shed. But the long hairs of their coats must be plucked daily, and dead hair should be stripped a few times a year.\n\nExperts also recommend brushing every day to avoid matting. Nails require monthly trimming. And you should check your pup's ears as part of your overall grooming routine.","care-exercise":"Though built for farm life, the Dandie Dinmont Terrier also thrives in the city—provided it gets enough exercise.\n\nTaking two relatively long walks each day is ideal—but keep in mind Dandie Dinmonts aren't built for a running or jogging pace. Ball-chasing is also a healthy activity as long as the area is securely fenced.\n\nThis breed enjoys dog sports such as agility, earthdog trials, flyball, hiking, retrieving, tracking, frisbee, musical freestyle, and competitive obedience.","care-training":"Training the Dandie Dinmont Terrier requires patience. But the breed responds well to reward-based training using yummy treats or favorite toys as motivation.\n\nA dog with a lot of get-up-and-go, the Dandie Dinmont is cooperative and eager to please. But it's a typical terrier at heart: stubborn, independent, and a little too self-confident. Considering this, you must train your Dandie Dinmont diligently to ensure they are well-mannered.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/dandie-dinmont-terrier/\n\nhttps://www.google.com/books/edition/Dandie_Dinmont_Terrier/2NwKBgAAQBAJ","reviewed-by":"Cindy

Samoyed's name comes from the nomadic Samoyedic people of Siberia—who bred these dogs to pull sleds, herd reindeer, and guard them against predators in frigid climates. Samoyeds also provided warmth, snuggling up with members of the tribe on the coldest nights. This popular breed still plays these dual roles of worker and loyal companion.\n\nQueen Alexandra of Denmark received one of the first Samoyeds imported to England in 1889. And she became a lifelong fan of the breed. The Samoyed arrived in the United States in 1906, when the Russian Grand Duke Nicholas gifted a fluffy white dog named Moustan of Argentaeu to the nation. It was the first Samoyed registered in the American Kennel Club.\n\nWith few reindeer to herd in the U.S. and Europe, Sammies instead hauled supplies for explorers. They excelled at this job thanks to their strength, enthusiasm, and ability to work in harsh conditions. Samoyeds were part of the first team of explorers to reach the South Pole.\n\nToday, the Samoyed is more likely to be hauling a wagonload of children to the park than hauling supplies across icy terrain. This good-natured breed has become a favorite family pet with an affectionate, up-for-anything attitude.","facts":"The Samoyed is a playful, alert breed that excels as both a family dog and a guard dog. Nicknamed \"The Smiley Dog,\" these pups appear to have permanent smiles on their faces. Powerful, active members of the working dog group, Samoyeds—or \"Sammies\"—are happiest when playing outdoors with their people.","traits-appearance":"Samoyeds are medium-sized dogs with thick, weather-resistant coats. They are known for their fluffy, solid-white fur, bright eyes, and slightly upturned mouths.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Samoyed's coat comes in various shades of white—including biscuit, cream, and pure white. These are double-coated dogs with a short, soft, thick undercoat and longer coarse hair on the outer coat. Both males and females have a \"ruff\" around their necks and shoulders (but it may be more pronounced on males).","traits-physical":"The \"Samoyed smile\" is the most distinctive (and adorable) trait of the breed. The upturned corners of their mouths, which give Sammies the appearance of a smile, help keep the dogs from drooling so icicles can't form around their mouths.","temperament":"Samoyeds are good-natured, active dogs that develop strong bonds with their families. They love and expect attention, making them excellent companions for anyone who wants a dog to tag along on all of their activities. Sammies are friendly with children, strangers, and even other animals.\n\nIf Samoyeds are alone for long periods, they may get bored and destructive. Howling and digging are their preferred activities when left by themselves for too long. Despite their Arctic roots, Samoyeds are not dogs that want to live outside alone.","care-nutrition":"Samoyeds are prone to becoming overweight. Their thick coats can hide extra pounds, so it's important to feel their bodies and check with the vet to determine if they need to go on a diet.\n\nThis breed requires a high-quality dog food that's age-appropriate. Just be sure to portion out meals with a measuring cup to avoid overfeeding.\n\nSammies are food-motivated and respond well to treats as a training reward. But be careful not to offer too many. As a general rule, treats should make up no more than 10% of a dog's daily calories.","care-grooming":"Samoyeds shed. A lot. Daily grooming can remove excess hair as well as mats and tangles. During seasonal shedding periods—which can occur twice every year—an undercoat rake can help remove dead hair and keep Samoyeds looking their best. Regular nail trims and ear cleanings should also be part of grooming routines.\n\nA good dental hygiene program is essential. Start a regular at-home [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) routine when your dog is young. And consult your veterinarian about professional dental cleanings so your Samoyed's smile always looks its best.","care-exercise":"Historically bred as working dogs, Samoyeds are active pets that require a lot of exercise. Daily walks—or runs—are a great start, but there are plenty of fun outlets for their energy. They love dog sports, such as sled or cart racing, packing, skijoring, agility, flyball, and obedience training.\n\nSamoyeds also appreciate room to run. Their speed and endurance (combined with a strong urge to run) make a securely fenced yard or dog park essential for off-leash play. This Arctic breed prefers cold weather and may be happier with indoor activities during the hot summer months. Games and tricks offer Samoyeds much-needed mental stimulation, as well.","care-training":"Training a Samoyed requires a firm but loving touch. Since this breed bonds closely with its people, it's eager to please and loves the one-on-one attention that training provides. However, Samoyeds also have stubborn streaks that can make training a challenge. Incorporate social activities and positive, reward-based training with treats, toys, and praise to help them achieve training goals.\n\nSammies are intelligent, fast learners, so it's important to switch up training activities to keep them from getting bored. Group obedience classes where they can interact with other people and dogs while learning new tricks are ideal.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/samoyed/\n\nhttps://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/dog-breeds/samoyed\n\nhttp://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/Samoyed.pdf","reviewed-by":"Cindy Elston, DVM, MPH","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":16.8,"weight-range-pet-max":31.8,"weight-range-show-min":16.8,"weight-range-show-max":29.9,"height-range-min":46.0,"height-range-max":56.0,"life-span-range-min":12.0,"life-span-range-max":15.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":92,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":55,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":37},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0f902b27-fbbc-5e47-ae33-055d4a83d8d8/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0f902b27-fbbc-5e47-ae33-055d4a83d8d8/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0f902b27-fbbc-5e47-ae33-055d4a83d8d8/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0f902b27-fbbc-5e47-ae33-055d4a83d8d8/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0f902b27-fbbc-5e47-ae33-055d4a83d8d8/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0f902b27-fbbc-5e47-ae33-055d4a83d8d8/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0f902b27-fbbc-5e47-ae33-055d4a83d8d8/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0f902b27-fbbc-5e47-ae33-055d4a83d8d8/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0f902b27-fbbc-5e47-ae33-055d4a83d8d8/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0f902b27-fbbc-5e47-ae33-055d4a83d8d8/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0f902b27-fbbc-5e47-ae33-055d4a83d8d8/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0f902b27-fbbc-5e47-ae33-055d4a83d8d8/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0f902b27-fbbc-5e47-ae33-055d4a83d8d8/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0f902b27-fbbc-5e47-ae33-055d4a83d8d8/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0f902b27-fbbc-5e47-ae33-055d4a83d8d8/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0f902b27-fbbc-5e47-ae33-055d4a83d8d8/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0f902b27-fbbc-5e47-ae33-055d4a83d8d8/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0f902b27-fbbc-5e47-ae33-055d4a83d8d8/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"0fb027b3-0377-5786-b8ff-74b7f4525cba","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/0fb027b3-0377-5786-b8ff-74b7f4525cba"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"basset-artesien-normand","name":"Basset Artésien Normand","plural-name":"Basset Artésiens Normands","published-at":"2023-09-19T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"For centuries, two strains of short-legged scent hounds have existed in the Normandy region of France: the Normand (bred for aesthetics) and the Basset d’Artois (bred for utility). The Basset Artesien Normand was developed by crossbreeding these two strains. French breeders first documented these dogs as a unique breed in 1870.\n\nThe Basset Artesien Normand hunted rabbits, foxes, and other small game alone or in packs with the hunter on foot, using their short legs to maneuver in dense brush skillfully. Though still used as hunting dogs, today, they are just as likely to be lounging in the house as family pets.","facts":"The Basset Artesien Normand is an intelligent, calm, obedient breed. Their keen noses make them excellent hunting dogs, while their friendly, playful personalities make them ideal family companions.","traits-appearance":"The Basset Artesien Normand has a long body, short legs, and strong, balanced appearance.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"This breed's coat is short and either tri-colored or fawn and white.","traits-physical":"Notable traits of the Basset Artesien Normand include a dome-shaped skull, large, oval eyes, and long, low-set ears. In addition, their legs are short and heavy-boned, and they have long saber-shaped tails.","temperament":"This breed is energetic, intelligent, and eager to please. These pack-oriented pups have social personalities and enjoy the company of people and other dogs. They are affectionate with their family members and are always game for an outdoor adventure.\n\nLike other scent hounds, Basset Artesien Normands are prone to wandering off wherever their noses lead them. For this reason, keeping them in a fenced yard or on a leash is best.","care-nutrition":"The Basset Artesien Normand does well on high-quality dog food formulated for their age, size, and activity level. Obesity in dogs is on the rise. Avoid overfeeding by measuring or weighing meals and keep treats to 10% or less of their daily calories.","care-grooming":"The Artesien Normand's short coat needs only weekly brushing to keep it free of loose hair and dirt. Because their long ears may make them more prone to ear infections, it's important to check their ears regularly and clean them when needed to remove wax build-up and debris. Additionally, nail trims and [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) should be part of their grooming routine.","care-exercise":"This hunting breed likes to get out and enjoy the great outdoors. Walks, hikes, and backyard games are great ways to let them burn energy (and have fun while doing it).","care-training":"Basset Artesien Normands are generally obedient pups that want to make their people happy. For best results, keep training sessions positive and use treats and favorite toys to reward them for desired behaviors. \n\nIn addition to obedience training, all breeds benefit from [early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization). Helping them feel comfortable with different people and environments when they're young will help them grow into well-adjusted adult dogs.","care-health":null,"references":"https://ckcusa.com/breeds/basset-artesian-normand/\n\nhttps://www.ukcdogs.com/basset-artesien-normand\n\nhttps://www.eukanuba.co.uk/breeds/norman-artesien-basset-(basset-artesien-normand)\n\nhttps://www.centrale-canine.fr/le-chien-de-race/basset-artesien-normand","reviewed-by":"Casey

Terrier","plural-name":"Airedale Terriers","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The Airedale Terrier hails from the Aire Valley in the north of England. During the height of the Industrial Revolution in the mid-19th century, factory workers set out to breed the Airedales as large, fearless hunters of rats and ducks. To create these hunting dogs, they included Otterhounds and a few breeds that are now extinct, like the English Black and Tan Terrier. Some believe that the Setters, Retrievers, and some herding dogs also went into the original Airedale.\n\nThe breed went on to serve with the British Armed Forces during the First World War, during which they acted as guard dogs and messengers. In the United States, the Airedale got a reputation for being an apt hunting dog, tracking down animals on land and water. Today, fans of the breed celebrate the Airdale’s versatility and companionship. ","facts":"The Airedale is the largest terrier breed and is sometimes known as “the King of Terriers.” This jolly dog is friendly, and they usually socialize well with people and other dogs. They aren’t known to be mischievous, and instead are quite adaptable to any living situation. ","traits-appearance":"This medium-sized breed is the biggest of the terrier group, with a well-balanced head, V-shaped ears, and small, dark eyes that are full of life.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Airedale Terrier has a dense, hard, and wiry coat that can be slightly wavy in areas. They are black and tan or dark grizzle and tan.","traits-physical":"While the Airedale has many of the same characteristics you’ll find in other members of the terrier family, the breeds’ larger-than-average size sets it apart. These dogs are sturdy and muscular, with males measuring about 23 inches in height at the shoulders.","temperament":"Though it’s a skilled hunter, the Airdale is calm and eager to please at home with its family. As a social dog, Airedales get along well with people and other animals, and they make a great family pet—but remember that they don’t love being left alone for long. The breed doesn’t generally tend to get into trouble, but the proper amount of exercise and mental stimulation can keep them from getting bored. ","care-nutrition":"The Airedale is an active breed that does best with high-quality dog food that’s suited to their particular age, as well as any additional health concerns.\n\nAs with any dog, it’s important to monitor the amount of food and treats that you give your Airedale, especially since some dogs may be prone to gaining weight as they age. Your veterinarian is always a good source to help provide you with appropriate nutrition and feeding guidelines.","care-grooming":"The Airedale has a short, wiry coat that requires minimal care. If you brush your Airedale’s coat once a week to remove loose and dead hair, their coat should remain strong and healthy.  Getting your Airedale professionally groomed three or four times a year, in addition to your weekly sessions, will keep them in even better shape.\n\nAll dogs require regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care), including at-home teeth brushing and professional dental cleanings, and the Airedale is no exception. Maintaining good dental hygiene is important for their overall long-term health.","care-exercise":"Like any terrier, the Airedale is full of energy and requires a lot of activity to remain happy and healthy.

Upon discovering these dogs, English explorers fell in love and brought them back home. The first Kennel Club stud book in 1870 contains mentions of the Landseer breed. In 1900, Swiss and German breeders started to take breeding of the Landseer seriously, working to create the standard—including their black and white markings—from which all purebred Landseers would follow.","facts":"The Landseer is a loyal, playful, and confident family dog. The breed thrives when given plenty of space to run and exercise, and doesn’t do well when left alone.","traits-appearance":"This large breed dog is similar in appearance to a Newfoundland, with its broad and massive features, large paws, and friendly, almond-shaped eyes. They are a longhaired breed with fur that’s dense and fine, and they have unique black and white markings.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Landseer has a double coat that’s long and dense on the outer coat, interspersed with a less dense undercoat. They are white with black on the torso and rump.\n\nA Landseer’s neck, front breast, barrel, belly, and tail are white, and their head is black.","traits-physical":"The Landseer is similar in physical appearance to the Newfoundland. However, its white snout with a solid white blaze makes this breed unique.","temperament":"The Landseer is a gentle, loving, and loyal family dog when they are properly trained and [socialized](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization).\n\nBecause of their large size, they generally need a lot of space to roam, exercise and play with their people. They can be territorial and possessive, and their independence can make it challenging to train them at times.","care-nutrition":"Your Landseer is a large breed that will do well with any age-appropriate, high-quality dog food that’s suited to their particular weight and any additional health concerns.\n\nAs with any dog, it’s important to monitor the amount of food and treats that you give your Landseer, especially since some dogs are prone to gaining weight as they age. Your veterinarian is always a good source to help provide you with appropriate nutrition and feeding guidelines.","care-grooming":"The Landseer’s double coat is generally easy to maintain, and a once-weekly brush with a pin brush for the body and comb for the feathering, behind the ears, and the tail should be plenty.\n\nAll dogs require regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care), including at-home teeth brushing and professional dental cleanings, and the Landseer is no exception. Maintaining good dental hygiene is important for their overall long-term health.","care-exercise":"This strong and agile breed is active and requires moderate exercise. A daily walk, run, or game of fetch in a fenced-in backyard will keep a Landseer happy. What the Landseer truly enjoys, though, is swimming, and they will jump in the water at every opportunity.","care-training":"The Landseer is a gentle and smart breed, and they are generally pretty easy to train.

The dog migrated with its human companions from Egypt to the Phoenician colonies, where it was preserved as a breed for 2,000 years.\n\nThey are jealously protected by the Maltese farmers who revere this beautiful hound. This reverence has protected the breed from significant changes, and they still resemble the pups that were carved on ancient Egyptian tombs.","facts":"Fast and elegant, these ancient hounds have been around for at least 3,000 years. Their lithe, athletic bodies were made for chasing prey on rough, rugged terrain. Calm and easy going at home, they love to roam outside and make excellent coursing dogs.","traits-appearance":"The Pharaoh Hound is a medium-sized hound whose clear-cut lines give it a noble characteristic. Exuding power, speed, and agility—particularly while chasing—they are incredibly fast and alert.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"They bear a glossy, short coat that is easy to maintain. Coloring spans a range of light browns from tan to chestnut. They may also have white markings, though that is not preferred for competitive breeders.","traits-physical":"The Pharaoh Hound has two wonderful traits: blushing and smiling. When they are happy or worked up, they will blush—the inside of their ears and nose will turn a rosy pink. And when they are particularly excited to see their owners, they will wiggle with delight while delivering a wide and toothy grin.\n\nCarrying the characteristic inverted S-shape of all hounds, the Pharaoh Hound is particularly aesthetic. Smooth, muscular bodies make for powerful and agile chasers.","temperament":"Wonderfully intelligent, loving, and happy, this dog fits in easily with the family. This includes kids and other pets. While not best suited for a guard dog, they are affectionate and loyal companions to the ones who love them.","care-nutrition":"Pharaoh Hounds require a high-quality dog food that is age-appropriate—whether it’s commercially manufactured or homemade (with a veterinarian’s supervision and approval). It’s important to monitor the amount of food you give your Pharaoh Hound. Reduce the portions or restrict calories if your pup gains weight.\n\nYour veterinarian is always a good source to help provide you with appropriate nutrition and feeding guidelines.","care-grooming":"Their short light coats need minimal care, with a heavy weekly brushing sufficient to maintain their health. They will likely need their nails trimmed, and you should make sure their ears are clean as well. They don’t exude a doggy odor usually, so if they do smell, it is important to get it checked out.\n\nAll dogs require regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care), including at-home teeth brushing and professional dental cleanings, and Pharaoh Hound is no exception. Maintaining good dental hygiene is important for their overall long-term health.","care-exercise":"Regular exercise is essential for this breed to stay fit and maintain its true form. The dogs can be self-runners, so as long as they have a large fenced-off area, they can exercise themselves. If this isn’t possible or your Pharaoh Hound isn’t a self runner, you will need to walk them twice a day for at least 20 minutes each time.","care-training":"The Pharaoh Hound takes to positive training, and loves pleasing its human companions. These dogs will learn quickly and respond well to most obedience cues. However, with their strong hunting instincts, it’s essential to always exercise this dog on a leash, or in a contained area, so they can’t escape. Even the most well-trained dogs will likely find it difficult to resist the call to freedom.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/pharaoh-hound/\n\nhttps://www.ph-club.org/the-illustrated-guide/\n\nhttp://www.ph-club.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/pharaoh-illustrated-standard-Feb-2018.pdf\n\nhttps://www.royalcanin.com/us/dogs/breeds/breed-library/pharaoh-hound","reviewed-by":"Annette Louviere, DVM","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":18.1,"weight-range-pet-max":30.8,"weight-range-show-min":20.4,"weight-range-show-max":24.9,"height-range-min":53.0,"height-range-max":64.0,"life-span-range-min":10.0,"life-span-range-max":14.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":109,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":71,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":42},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/11ef084f-acc6-5f2b-b72b-ba64f68480e8/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/11ef084f-acc6-5f2b-b72b-ba64f68480e8/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/11ef084f-acc6-5f2b-b72b-ba64f68480e8/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/11ef084f-acc6-5f2b-b72b-ba64f68480e8/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/11ef084f-acc6-5f2b-b72b-ba64f68480e8/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/11ef084f-acc6-5f2b-b72b-ba64f68480e8/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/11ef084f-acc6-5f2b-b72b-ba64f68480e8/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/11ef084f-acc6-5f2b-b72b-ba64f68480e8/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/11ef084f-acc6-5f2b-b72b-ba64f68480e8/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/11ef084f-acc6-5f2b-b72b-ba64f68480e8/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/11ef084f-acc6-5f2b-b72b-ba64f68480e8/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/11ef084f-acc6-5f2b-b72b-ba64f68480e8/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/11ef084f-acc6-5f2b-b72b-ba64f68480e8/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/11ef084f-acc6-5f2b-b72b-ba64f68480e8/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/11ef084f-acc6-5f2b-b72b-ba64f68480e8/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/11ef084f-acc6-5f2b-b72b-ba64f68480e8/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/11ef084f-acc6-5f2b-b72b-ba64f68480e8/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/11ef084f-acc6-5f2b-b72b-ba64f68480e8/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"122fd7d5-2114-5e0c-8e56-864c0b920bfc","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/122fd7d5-2114-5e0c-8e56-864c0b920bfc"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"polish-tatra-sheepdog","name":"Polish Tatra Sheepdog","plural-name":"Polish Tatra Sheepdogs","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The Polish Tatra Sheepdog originated from the mountains of Poland several thousand years ago. Also known as the Owczarek Podhalanski or Polish Mountain Sheepdog, the breed likely descends from the Mastiff.\n\nTatras were popular dual-purpose working dogs, bred to herd and guard livestock on a minimal diet—in both cold, harsh temperatures and intense, dry heat. Later, these massive dogs pulled carts and worked as military, police, and guide dogs.\n\nWhen Poland fell under communist rule after World War II, Tatras faced uncertain times and even approached extinction. But the Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI) remained steadfast in its preservation efforts. By the 1960s, a campaign encouraged the breeding of these beautiful and hard-working dogs.\n\nBy the 1980s, the breed arrived in America and Canada. The United Kennel Club recognized the Tatra in 1995.","facts":"Underneath the Polish Tatra Sheepdog's white, fluffy coat is a calm,\n\nquiet, independent spirit. These alert, intelligent dogs are hard workers, natural guardians, and gentle giants.","traits-appearance":"The Tatra is a giant breed that gives the impression of power and stamina. These heavy-boned dogs have compact, muscular bodies and snow-white coats.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Tatras have thick topcoats (that are straight or slightly wavy) and dense undercoats—both of which enable them to withstand harsh conditions. The hair on the breed's head, muzzle, and legs is short. The rest of the body has longer hair, including a thick ruff around the neck and profuse hair on the thighs and tail. Polish Tatra Sheepdogs are typically pure white.","traits-physical":"The Tatra's other notable traits include a slightly domed skull, pronounced muzzle, and dark brown, expressive eyes. These dogs have long, massive bodies and tails that, when hanging, reach to the hock.","temperament":"Though they are working dogs through and through, Tatras also make good family dogs and are gentle and reliable with children. However, due to their massive size, these pups still require supervision when around kids. Tatras usually get along well with other household pets, too. But they may be wary of strangers.\n\nTypical of livestock guardians, Tatras are naturally protective. Though calm and intelligent, they require socialization throughout their lives to overcome their independent nature and strong guarding instincts.","care-nutrition":"Tatras need high-quality food appropriate for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). Because of their size, they also benefit from diets formulated for large breeds—particularly when they are puppies. This prevents them from growing too fast and developing skeletal problems.","care-grooming":"Despite their thick, fluffy coats, Tatras have manageable grooming needs. Their coats are self-cleaning and rarely need washing. (Good news to anyone who has tried to give a bath to a 50+ kg dog!) This breed does, however, require weekly brushing to remove loose hair. And in the Spring—when Tatras blow their coats—you'll want to brush daily.\n\nIn addition to brushing your dog's coat, be sure to keep their nails trimmed and ears cleaned. A dental hygiene routine, including at-home care and professional cleanings, is also essential for your pup's overall health.","care-exercise":"As working dogs with a lot of energy and stamina, Tatras need lots of exercise.

He took in a semi-feral mother and her litter of kittens that he found roaming his property in Chattanooga. He soon realized that two of the male kittens had unique-looking coats—their soft, red fur was curly and had a shimmery sheen.\n\nNot knowing much about cat breeding himself, Franklin contacted breeders, feline geneticists, and representatives from The International Cat Association (TICA). Through this research, Franklin learned that his cats possessed a new recessive gene that produced curly coats with a satin effect. He then began a breeding program, in partnership with other breeders, to preserve this new mutation.\n\nThe Tennessee Rex is currently working toward Championship status with TICA and remains a rare breed.","facts":"The Tennessee Rex (also known as the T-Rex) is a relatively new cat breed. Their curly, satiny coats are sure to catch your eye, while their gentle, playful personalities will warm your heart.","traits-appearance":"Tennessee Rex are medium-to-large cats with a naturally occurring gene mutation that gives them a curly, glistening coat. They have long, rectangular bodies and muscular, athletic builds.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The T-Rex comes in longhaired and shorthaired varieties. Longhairs have medium-long fur and a fully plumed tail, whereas shorthairs have medium-short hair with a reed tail. In both varieties, curls are more prominent on the neck and jowls than under the chin. And tight curls become longer and wavier as they move down the length of the body. Even the breed's whiskers can be wavy or curly.\n\nThe satin effect causes the hair to sparkle in the light and intensifies the color of the coat. All coat colors and patterns are possible.","traits-physical":"Aside from coat, the Tennessee Rex's other distinguishing features include a modified wedge-shaped head, medium-large, cupped ears, and large, almond-shaped eyes.","temperament":"The Tennessee Rex is a gentle, people-oriented breed that wants to be part of the family. They love to follow their humans around the house, curl up on the couch, and share the bed at night. They're also generally quiet cats with playful personalities.","care-nutrition":"Tennessee Rex require a high-quality diet. Because nutritional needs vary for kittens, adults, and senior cats, opt for a formula that's age-appropriate for your pet.\n\nAll cats are at risk of obesity if they overeat. One easy way to avoid overfeeding is to use a standard measuring cup to portion out their food. And don't forget to account for treats. As a guideline, they should make up no more than 10% of your cat's calories.\n\nLastly, all cats need access to fresh, clean water around the clock.","care-grooming":"Both longhaired and shorthaired T-Rex need regular brushing to remove loose hair. Once a week is typically enough for shorthaired cats. Longhaired cats need more frequent brushing (up to three times a week) to prevent mats or tangles.\n\nGrooming routines should also include regular ear cleanings to clear wax build-up and monthly nail trims to keep their claws in good shape. Long nails are more likely to snag on something and become torn or damaged. They can even grow into your cat's paw pads, leading to pain or infection. In addition to clipping, providing a scratching post will allow your cat to do some nail maintenance themselves (thanks to their instinct to scratch).\n\nAs a final grooming to-do, aim to brush your cat's teeth daily and schedule visits with your veterinarian for professional dental cleanings and exams. Besides giving your cat better breath, such efforts will support their overall health.","care-exercise":null,"care-training":null,"care-health":"Roughly one out of every three cats in the United States is overweight or obese.

Wolfdog","plural-name":"Saarloos Wolfdogs","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"In the early 1930s, Leendert Saarloos began breeding German Shepherd Dogs with wolves in the Netherlands. He sought to create a hardy, self-reliant companion dog that possessed some of the fundamental behavioral characteristics he felt German Shepherd Dogs had lost. The result was the Saarloos Wolfdog.\n\nThough not intended as a working dog, the Saarloos Wolfdog initially showed promise as a guide for the blind. But over time, it became clear the breed wasn't suited for such work. And Saarloos' experiment ultimately backfired when the Wolfdog exhibited the contradictory attributes of caution, reservation, and lack of ferocity.\n\nThe United Kennel Club recognized the Saarloos Wolfdog in 2006.","facts":"The Saarloos Wolfdog is a proud, lively breed with an independent nature. These reliable, wolf-like dogs are affectionate with their people and make good watchdogs.","traits-appearance":"There's no mistaking this breed's ancestry when you first see their wolfish good looks. The Saarloos Wolfdog has a strong and balanced appearance, with well-pronounced differences between males and females.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The breed has a thick, double coat with harsh, straight hairs and a soft undercoat. In the winter, the undercoat is the most noticeable. And in the summer, the topcoat predominates.\n\nThe most common coloring is classic \"wolf grey.\" However, \"wolf brown\" (light to dark shaded brown) and white are other possible colors. In \"wolf grey\" and \"wolf brown\" dogs, pale creamy white or white markings appear on the body's underside, the inner side of the legs, the breeches, and under the tail.","traits-physical":"Saarloos Wolfdogs have the long front legs and the powerful hind legs of a German Shepherd. Their ears are upright or \"prick,\" and their eyes are yellow and almond-shaped. They have full, bushy tails that hang low—often between their legs.","temperament":"Though lively and independent, Saarloos Wolfdogs are typically reserved around strangers. They may seem aloof, which isn't surprising considering the breed so recently descended from wolves.\n\nThat said, these dogs are very devoted to their people and form tight bonds with them. They're protective of family and make good watchdogs. For the same reason, they may need help socializing and living among a full household or other animals.","care-nutrition":"Saarloos Wolfdogs need high-quality food appropriate for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). They also benefit from diets formulated for large breeds—particularly when they're puppies. Feeding a large-breed puppy diet helps prevent Saarloos Wolfdogs from growing too fast and developing skeletal problems.\n\nSince all dogs are at risk for obesity if they overeat, it's crucial to monitor your pup's food intake. And don't forget to account for treats—they should make up no more than 10% of your dog's calories.","care-grooming":"Saarloos Wolfdogs have thick double coats and shed year-round. So, be sure to brush your dog a couple of times a week to remove loose hair. When shedding is heaviest (during summer and fall), this breed may need more frequent brushing—up to several times a week.\n\nIt's also wise to keep your Saarloos Wolfdog's nails trimmed and ears clean to prevent infections. Regular dental care—including at-home teeth brushing and professional cleanings—should also be part of every dog's grooming routine, regardless of breed.","care-exercise":"This active breed needs lots of mental and physical exercise. Daily long walks or runs allow them to burn energy—and, in turn, prevent unwanted behaviors, such as barking. Saarloos Wolfdogs like to roam, but its best to keep them in an enclosed area to keep them from getting lost.","care-training":"Saarloos Wolfdogs are an easy breed to train, responding favorably to rewards. They benefit from a firm owner that sets boundaries.\n\nWith close wolf ancestors, these pups also require careful socialization to prevent or reduce fear-based defensive

Domestic Cat","plural-name":null,"published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"cat","history":"Like all cats, the Irish Domestic can trace its roots to the *Felis silvestris* population, particularly those near the Fertile Crescent. Experts believe the pet cats we know and love today descended from these wildcats roughly 10,000 years ago. However, when and how those domesticated cats found their way to Ireland is unconfirmed. They likely arrived courtesy of industrious settlers and invading armies nearly 2,000 years ago. \n\nWhat's not up for debate is the enduring popularity of cats in Ireland. In fact, cats were so beloved that in the Middle Ages, a set of laws known as *Catslechtae* described penalties associated with mistreating these feline friends. And today, there are approximately 325,000 cats keeping households company throughout Ireland.\n\nIrish Domestic cats are not pedigreed cats. Rather, they are random-bred cats that have developed in Ireland and adapted to their native environment. Despite lacking purebred status, some cat associations allow them to compete in shows in a general \"housecat\" category.\n","facts":"Irish Domestic cats run the gamut when it comes to personality and appearance. That means there's bound to be one just right for you.","traits-appearance":"Irish Domestics come in a wide range of colors, sizes, and builds, though typically, they are medium-sized with well-balanced bodies.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"These cats come in all coat colors, patterns, and lengths.","traits-physical":"Irish Domestics don't have a defined breed standard. The typical Domestic may display any number of adorable features.","temperament":"An Irish Domestic's personality can vary greatly. They can be quiet or vocal, playful or mellow. However, they are generally intelligent, free-spirited cats.\n\nIrish Domestics are often athletic cats and natural hunters. Using feather wands and other toys they can pounce on or chase are great ways to keep them active and engaged.\n\nDomestics also tend to enjoy high perches where they can safely look out at birds and other wildlife.","care-nutrition":"Irish Domestic cats thrive on a high-quality diet. Because nutritional needs vary for kittens, adults, and senior cats, choose a formula that's age-appropriate for your pet.\n\nTo prevent overfeeding, carefully measure portions and reduce amounts if your cat gains excess weight. And keep an eye on how many treats you're giving them. As a guideline, treats should be kept to 10% of a cat's daily calories or less.\n\nIn addition to meals, provide your cat with plenty of fresh, clean water.","care-grooming":"Irish Domestics are typically excellent self-groomers. Still, they need regular brushing to keep their coats looking their best. Weekly brushing is usually enough for shorthaired cats. Longhaired cats are more prone to tangles and mats and may require daily brushing.\n\nIn addition to combing, trim their claws monthly to prevent overgrowth. Overgrown nails are more likely to snag on something, become torn or damaged, or even grow into the paw pads—leading to pain or infection. In addition to clipping, a scratching post will help keep your cat's nails in good shape and satisfy their instinct to scratch.\n\nFinally, all cats need regular dental care—including at-home teeth brushing and professional dental exams and cleanings.","care-exercise":null,"care-training":null,"care-health":"Obesity is a growing concern in cats.

As a result, they earned the name \"King Charles Spaniel,\" as well as the more colloquial \"Charlie.\" (Outside of the United States and Canada, people still refer to the breed by these names.) They were also sometimes called \"comforter spaniels,\" as they served as lap or foot warmers.\n\nThe breed's modern (and very cute!) appearance is the result of crossing short-snouted Japanese toy breeds, such as the [Pug](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/pug) or Japanese Chin, with small, long-snouted European spaniels. Throughout early breeding, English Toy Spaniels began to inherit keen hunting qualities. As centuries passed, however, these qualities diminished. Today, they are lap dogs once again—a role they continue to excel at and seem to thoroughly enjoy.\n\nThe American Kennel Club admitted the English Toy Spaniel in 1886, making it the third recognized breed in the Toy group.","facts":"The English Toy Spaniel is a gentle and loving breed. Eager to please and friendly toward people and animals, English Toy Spaniels make excellent companions and wonderful pets.","traits-appearance":"English Toy Spaniels are compact, sturdy, square-shaped toy dogs. They're known for their pushed-in nose, domed head, affectionate demeanor, and silky, flowing coat.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The English Toy Spaniel has a thick, glossy coat that can be straight or slightly wavy. There is heavy fringing on the ears, body, and chest, with feathering on the legs and feet.\n\nTheir coats come in four varieties, each with a unique name: Blenheim (red and white), Prince Charles (black and tan with white markings), King Charles (black and tan), and Ruby (red). These varieties may have a small white spot on the chest. The coats in Prince Charles and King Charles varieties are longer than the other two.","traits-physical":"The English Toy Spaniel has a recognizable dome-shaped head that's large in comparison to its overall size. Its muzzle is very short, with the nose pushed back and ample cushioning under the eyes. It also has a slight underbite.\n\nThe breed's dazzling eyes are large, very dark brown or black, and set squarely in line with the nose. Many English Toy Spaniels are born with a shorter or screw tail.","temperament":"English Toy Spaniels are a gentle and loving lap dog that doesn't require a lot of exercise, making them a great breed for apartment living or less active households.\n\nCalm, happy, and playful family dogs, English Toy Spaniels are typically friendly towards strangers, kids, and other pets. However, careful training is needed to keep them from developing small dog syndrome (i.e., the perception that they're bigger than they truly are).\n\nThough they're intelligent and eager to please, English Toy Spaniels can sometimes be stubborn. Overall, this breed needs consistent training and lots of attention to be happy.","care-nutrition":"English Toy Spaniels have little stomachs that don't allow them to eat big meals. So, it's best to break their food up into several small meals throughout the day.\n\nThis breed thrives on a diet formulated for their specific life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). Additionally, a diet created for small-breed dogs will have the appropriate blend of nutrients and a smaller kibble size to properly chew and digest their food.\n\nTo keep English Toy Spaniels at an ideal weight, keep a close eye on the amount of food they eat each day. To avoid accidental overfeeding, portion out their food using a measuring cup. And don't forget to account for treats when considering their daily calories. Even a couple of extra treats can add up for such a small dog. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of your dog's calories.","care-grooming":"Brushing your English Toy Spaniel's long, silky coat at least twice a week will prevent painful mats and tangles. Regular baths and trimming around the face and paws will also help keep this breed looking its best.\n\nThe English Toy Spaniel's long ears may make them more susceptible to ear infections. For this reason, check and clean your pup's ears regularly to prevent infections from developing.\n\nToy breeds are more likely to have dental issues due to their small mouths and crowded teeth. Regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care), including at-home teeth brushing, is essential for their overall long-term health. Because of their increased risk of dental disease, English Toy Spaniels may require more frequent professional cleanings beginning at an earlier age.","care-exercise":"When not curled up on their favorite human's lap, English Toy Spaniels need moderate daily exercise. Leisurely walks outside and indoor play sessions are typically enough to do the trick.\n\nShort-faced breeds like the English Toy Spaniel can't tolerate hot weather. They shouldn't be left outside or made to do strenuous activities on warm or humid days.","care-training":"English Toy Spaniels are a naturally well-behaved and typically obedient breed. However, they do benefit from a patient, consistent training style.\n\nThey are often food-motivated and respond well to reward-based training. However, some English Toy Spaniels can be picky eaters. So, it may take some trial and error to find a tasty treat they're willing to work for.\n\nFinally, [early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) will help your English Toy Spaniel mature into well-adjusted adult

de Presa Canario","plural-name":"Perro de Presa Canarios","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"Perro de Presa Canarios—also known as Dogo Canarios (Canary dog)—originated during the 19th century in the Canary Islands. Breeders developed these large dogs for dogfighting, guarding, and herding. Experts believe the Bardino Majero—a now extinct breed indigenous to the Canaries—and imported English Mastiffs contributed to the breed's development.\n\nBy the 1960s, Perro de Presa Canarios faced extinction. Dogfighting was outlawed, and popular foreign dogs such as the [German Shepherd Dog](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/german-shepherd-dog), [Doberman Pinscher](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/dobermann-pinscher), and [Great Dane](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/great-dane) had arrived on the islands. As a result, the Perro de Presa Canario's numbers had dwindled. Fortunately, an American veterinarian named Dr. Carl Semenci revived the breed, giving these dogs a fighting chance.\n\nThe Perro de Presa Canario is a member of the American Kennel Club Foundation Stock Service.","facts":"The Perro de Presa Canarios is a confident, strong-willed, and intelligent breed. These composed and focused dogs were traditionally used for herding cattle and make good farm dogs. Loyal and calm with their family—but cautious of strangers—Perro de Presa Canarios are one tough breed.","traits-appearance":"A powerful and rare breed, the Perro de Presa Canario is a handsome, medium-sized dog with a dense, muscular body that exudes strength and power.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Perro de Presa Canario's short coat comes in brindle (generally brown and black stripes), as well as blue (gray) or blond, fawn, and sandy. White markings are possible on the chest and toes. According to the breed standard, if a mask is present, it should always be black.","traits-physical":"Notable features of the Perro de Presa Canario include a solid, square head, and paws that are neat and round, with high-arched toes (also called a cat foot).","temperament":"Perro de Presa Canarios have steady dispositions. They are quiet, affectionate, and friendly dogs—but they're also protective of their territory and wary of strangers.\n\nPresa Canarios don't always get along with other dogs. [Early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) is vital to help them be comfortable around dogs.\n\nThe calm personality of this breed makes it ideal for different types of living environments. They can be happy in a home with a yard or a large estate in the country.","care-nutrition":"Presa Canarios require a high-quality dog food that is age-appropriate—whether it's commercially manufactured or homemade (with a veterinarian's supervision and approval).\n\nAs with any dog, it's important to monitor the amount of food you feed your Perro de Presa Canario and reduce the portions if your pup gains weight. Also, remember that too many treats on top of their regular meals can contribute to obesity.","care-grooming":"Weekly brushing and an occasional bath are all Perro de Presa Canarios need to keep them clean and looking their best. This breed has quick-growing nails that need regular trimming to prevent overgrowth, splitting, and cracking. And their ears should be checked consistently for wax buildup or debris.","care-exercise":"Perro de Presa Canarios are very energetic and athletic. They require daily physical exercise, such as long walks on a leash and training activities, including tracking and trailing.\n\nThey also need plenty of outdoor space (think large back yard) for roaming and playing. This is not a breed you're likely to find lying around and doing nothing.","care-training":"Perro de Presa Canarios require a strong, confident, dedicated, and experienced owner—someone to be the pack leader. [Firm and structured trainin](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-obedience-training) will help temper their instinct to guard and help them be safe household companions.\n\nPerro de Presa Canarios learn quickly and are naturals when it comes to training. They're capable of learning many tasks, such as herding and obedience.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/perro-de-presa-canario/\n\nhttps://www.google.com/books/edition/Perro_De_Presa_Canario/mOwKBgAAQBA","reviewed-by":"Cindy Elston, DVM, MPH","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":33.1,"weight-range-pet-max":53.1,"weight-range-show-min":37.6,"weight-range-show-max":47.6,"height-range-min":56.0,"height-range-max":66.0,"life-span-range-min":9.0,"life-span-range-max":11.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":100,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":63,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":41},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/13cbf9db-6d9c-5cbd-ab62-1ff7e8b730a9/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/13cbf9db-6d9c-5cbd-ab62-1ff7e8b730a9/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/13cbf9db-6d9c-5cbd-ab62-1ff7e8b730a9/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/13cbf9db-6d9c-5cbd-ab62-1ff7e8b730a9/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/13cbf9db-6d9c-5cbd-ab62-1ff7e8b730a9/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/13cbf9db-6d9c-5cbd-ab62-1ff7e8b730a9/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/13cbf9db-6d9c-5cbd-ab62-1ff7e8b730a9/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/13cbf9db-6d9c-5cbd-ab62-1ff7e8b730a9/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/13cbf9db-6d9c-5cbd-ab62-1ff7e8b730a9/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/13cbf9db-6d9c-5cbd-ab62-1ff7e8b730a9/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/13cbf9db-6d9c-5cbd-ab62-1ff7e8b730a9/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/13cbf9db-6d9c-5cbd-ab62-1ff7e8b730a9/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/13cbf9db-6d9c-5cbd-ab62-1ff7e8b730a9/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/13cbf9db-6d9c-5cbd-ab62-1ff7e8b730a9/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/13cbf9db-6d9c-5cbd-ab62-1ff7e8b730a9/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/13cbf9db-6d9c-5cbd-ab62-1ff7e8b730a9/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/13cbf9db-6d9c-5cbd-ab62-1ff7e8b730a9/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/13cbf9db-6d9c-5cbd-ab62-1ff7e8b730a9/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"14131534-5879-5fd3-bd4d-724f371f3fb0","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/14131534-5879-5fd3-bd4d-724f371f3fb0"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"danish-swedish-farmdog","name":"Danish Swedish Farmdog","plural-name":"Danish-Swedish Farmdogs","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"An older breed, the Danish Swedish Farmdog originated in Eastern Denmark and Southern Sweden and is now prevalent throughout Scandinavia. These dogs have been known by several names—including the Old Danish Fox Terrier, Scanian Terrier, Danish Pinscher, and, simply, the Rat Dog. Though the Danish Swedish Farmdog bears a striking resemblance to the Russell Terrier and Fox Terrier, it actually belongs to the Pinscher family.\n\nThroughout history, Danish Swedish Farmdogs served as guardians, hunters, and vermin catchers. But as the world became more modernized and dependent on machinery, the need for small working dogs like the Danish Swedish Farmdog decreased. As a result, this breed nearly vanished. But true to its feisty terrier ancestry, the Danish Swedish Farmdog held on.\n\nIn 1987, the Danish and Swedish Kennel Clubs recognized the breed—followed by the United Kennel Club in 2008 and the American Kennel Club in 2011.","facts":"The Danish Swedish Farmdog is a versatile working breed and lovable family pet. These intelligent pups have outgoing personalities and enough energy to keep up with their humans all day long. But when it's time to cuddle up on the couch, you don't have to ask these little dogs twice.","traits-appearance":"The small Danish Swedish Farmdog has a compact, rectangular-shaped body.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"This breed's coat is smooth, short, and harsh. Danish Swedish Farmdogs are predominantly white with patches of tan, brown, or black (or a combination of colors) on the body and head. Some dogs have flecking in their coats.","traits-physical":"Danish Swedish Farmdogs have triangular-shaped heads that are small in proportion to their bodies. The breed's dark, rounded eyes give an attentive, kind expression. Rose or button ears fold just above the skull. The tail can be long or naturally short and stumpy.","temperament":"Danish Swedish Farmdogs are playful, rambunctious, and usually friendly dogs. Though bred to work, they make affectionate family pets. They're great with kids and typically get along with other dogs.\n\nDanish Swedish Farmdogs need regular exercise, but they know how to enjoy downtime (preferably curled up in a lap), too. Because they're slower to mature than other breeds, you can expect this breed's \"puppy phase\" to last longer than most.\n\nLeft to their own devices, Danish Swedish Farmdogs sometimes decide to occupy themselves with undesirable or destructive behaviors, such as chewing or digging. And since old habits die hard, these hunters and ratters may chase small pets or wildlife.","care-nutrition":"Danish Swedish Farmdogs require a diet formulated for their specific life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). Experts also recommend a food designed for small breeds. Such diets have the appropriate blend of nutrients and a smaller kibble size that is easier for little dogs to chew and digest.\n\nAll dogs can become overweight if they eat too many calories. So, keep an eye on how much you're feeding, and don't forget to account for treats. In general, treats should make up no more than 10% of a dog's calories.","care-grooming":"The Danish Swedish Farmdog's short coat is a breeze to maintain. Just brush your pup occasionally to remove any loose hair and bathe them if they get into anything dirty or stinky.\n\nTheir grooming routine should also include regular nail trims and ear cleanings. Lastly, get them started on a good dental hygiene program. Small dogs like the Danish Swedish Farmdog are particularly susceptible to dental issues due to their small mouths and crowded teeth. At-home dental care and professional cleanings are both essential to this breed's overall health.","care-exercise":"These energetic dogs need daily physical and mental exercise to stay happy and healthy. They love a challenge, so dog sports—including agility, lure coursing, tracking, nose work, and competitive obedience—work well for this breed. Danish Swedish Farmdogs also enjoy brisk walks with their humans and playtime in a fenced backyard.","care-training":"Danish Swedish Farmdogs are very intelligent and highly trainable. And because of their working dog background, they're generally eager to please. Positive reinforcement with treats or a favorite toy is often an effective approach for training this

Munchkin breed originated in 1983, though the gene mutation responsible for shortlegged cats dates back to 1930s England. A British veterinarian was the first to document four generations of cats with short legs. Reports of the mutation later appeared in Russia in the 1950s and New England in the 1970s.\n\nThe first Munchkin was a stray cat named Blackberry. Sandra Hockenedel found the pregnant shortlegged cat and took her in. When Blackberry had her litter, Sandra gave one of the kittens to a friend named Kay LaFrance. Sandra and Kay then used these two cats as the foundation for the Munchkin breed—outcrossing them with domestic cats to create diversity in the gene pool. Inspiration from the breed name came from **The Wizard of Oz**.\n\nResearch has found the gene that causes short legs to be dominant. That means a kitten needs to inherit a copy of the gene from just one parent to express the shortlegged trait. Studies also suggest that embryos carrying two copies of the mutated gene are often not viable and will not develop. For this reason, Munchkins must not be bred together—one parent should be a non-Munchkin breed.\n\nTICA accepted the Munchkin into its new breed program in 1994 and granted it Championship status in 2003. But no other major cat fancy associations have followed suit. Questions about potential long-term health issues and controversy surrounding the ethics of perpetuating the gene mutation have kept other associations from recognizing the breed.","facts":"The first thing you'll likely notice about Munchkins is their short legs. But once you get to know these cats, their playful personalities and boundless energy are what leave a lasting impression.","traits-appearance":"Small-to-medium-sized cats, Munchkins are most easily identified by their especially short legs.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Munchkins have all-weather coats that come in both longhaired and shorthaired varieties. Longhaired Munchkins have semi-long, silky coats, whereas the shorthairs have medium-length, semi-plush coats. Both types come in a wide assortment of colors and patterns.","traits-physical":"This breed's key traits include a wedge-shaped head with rounded contours, walnut-shaped eyes, a well-rounded chest, firmly developed muscles, and—of course—short legs.","temperament":"Munchkins are playful, social cats that enjoy the company of other cats, dogs, and humans (including kids). They have a curious nature and like to explore their surroundings—often by sitting up on their haunches for a better view. Though they can't leap to high locations in a single bound, these lowriders use their intelligence and determination to get just about anywhere they want to go.\n\nBuilt for racing, Munchkins love to chase after toys, run around the house, and take corners at impressive speeds. But when it's time to settle down, these affectionate cats are happy to curl up in a lap for a snooze.","care-nutrition":"Munchkins need a high-quality diet formulated for their current life stage (e.g., kitten, adult, senior).\n\nTo keep your cat at a healthy weight, measure out meals and reduce portions if necessary. And don't forget to account for treats. As a guideline, they should make up no more than 10% of a cat's calories.\n\nFinally, all cats need access to fresh, clean water around the clock.","care-grooming":"Munchkins' coats are relatively easy to maintain. Shorthaired cats need weekly brushing with a fine comb to remove loose fur. Longhaired cats require more frequent brushing—ideally up to three times per week—to prevent mats and tangles.\n\nMost cats' nails require monthly trimming to prevent them from getting too long. Long nails are more likely to snag on something and become torn or damaged. They can even grow into your cat's paw pads, leading to pain or infection. In addition to clipping, providing a scratching post will allow your cat to do some nail maintenance themselves (thanks to their instinct to scratch).\n\nNo grooming routine is complete without a little dental hygiene. To support your Munchkin's overall health, brush their teeth daily and schedule visits with your veterinarian for professional dental cleanings and exams.","care-exercise":null,"care-training":null,"care-health":"Roughly one out of every three cats in the United States is overweight or obese. And those extra pounds can contribute to other health risks—such as arthritis, diabetes, and heart problems.

Russian migrants traveled to Finland with their dogs more than 3,000 years ago, and the breed fast became popular hunting dogs.\n\nThe Finnish—whose name for the breed is Suomenpystykorva—still use these dogs to flush out birds and hunt game. Finnish Spitz are also good all-around companions and have become popular, beloved pets in Finland (with a growing following around the world).\n\nAlso known as Finkies or Finns, these dogs follow their noses to find birds and use their slow-wagging tails and rapid barks to freeze game in place. Hunters then scout the woods looking for the swishing tails and take down the game their dogs are guarding.\n\nBy 1880, transportation had evolved and brought diverse people (and their dogs) together. The Finnish Spitz mated with other dog breeds and approached extinction as a distinct breed. To rescue the breed, breeders created a foundation stock of pure Spitz. The breed—and its hunting prowess—were restored.","facts":"The Finnish Spitz is a small, fearless hunting breed that is tenacious in its pursuit of game. The only thing this breed does better than flush out its prey is bark. Frequent vocalizations earned the Finnish Spitz the nickname \"barking bird dog.\"","traits-appearance":"Finnish Spitz are medium-sized dogs with balanced bodies, bold carriage, brisk movements, and a fox-like appearance.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Finnish Spitz is a double-coated breed. They have short, soft, dense undercoats in a paler color and long, harsh, straight hairs on their outer coats. Their coats are stiffer and longer on their necks and back. Male dogs also have more profuse coats around their shoulders.\n\nTheir fox-like appearance is partially due to their red coat color, which ranges from pale honey to deep auburn. Because the breed's coloring includes shades of red and is never monochromatic, people have described it as having a \"Finnish Spitz glow.\" Some dogs may have white markings on the tips of the toes and black hairs along the lip line.","traits-physical":"Distinguishing traits of the Finnish Spitz include square proportions, almond-shaped eyes, small ears that stand erect when alert, a narrow muzzle, and a plumed tail.","temperament":"The Finnish Spitz is an active, eager, and friendly dog with a reputation as an excellent hunter. In addition to their hunting skills, they also make fantastic watchdogs (in part because they tend to be suspicious of strangers).\n\nFinnish Spitz love to bark and \"practice\" often. Their propensity for barking—they can bark up to 160 times in one minute—is perfect for King Barker competitions like those held in Finland. However, it's not a skill that neighbors with shared walls tend to appreciate, so apartment life is not a good fit for these dogs.\n\nFinnish Spitz can be independent and stubborn, but also affectionate and sensitive. These sporty dogs need lots of exercise. Thanks to the deep bonds that the breed forms with their families, they prefer being part of family activities.\n\nTheir keen sense smell—which makes them invaluable on hunting trips—makes the Finnish Spitz prone to following their noses whenever they're outside. It's best to keep them on a leash or in a fenced yard to keep them from roaming.","care-nutrition":"Though the Finnish Spitz is a highly active breed, these dogs also have efficient metabolisms. Be careful not to overfeed them, which can lead to obesity. Choose a high-quality dog food that's appropriate for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior) and look for foods formulated for active breeds. Limiting treats to no more than 10% of daily calories can help keep Finnish Spitz at a healthy weight.","care-grooming":"When it comes to grooming, the Finnish Spitz requires little more than the occasional bath and brushing. However, they go through periods of seasonal shedding twice a year. During these times, they benefit from extra brushing to remove dead hair. Intact females tend to have more severe shedding than spayed females.\n\nFinnish Spitz also benefit from regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care). Start brushing their teeth at home when they're young and consult with a veterinarian about professional dental cleanings to ensure good oral hygiene.","care-exercise":"Finnish Spitz are eager athletes bred to spend hours racing through dense woods in pursuit of prey. While the breed has transitioned from a hunting dog to a human companion, these dogs still require a lot of exercise. Long leashed walks (or runs) are necessary to tire out a Finnish Spitz. These dogs are known for their speed and stamina—without a secure fence, one of these pups can run for hours.\n\nObedience competitions, flyball, rally, lure coursing, and other activities that allow the breed to show off their speed and stamina are excellent for Finnish Spitz.","care-training":"Like most highly intelligent breeds, the Finnish Spitz can be hard to train. Keep training sessions short and upbeat, and reduce their stubborn tendencies by using motivational tools such as treats and favorite toys. Finnish Spitz also love spending time with their people, and training sessions provide a fun opportunity for bonding.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/finnish-spitz/","reviewed-by":"Laura Inman, DVM","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":10.4,"weight-range-pet-max":21.8,"weight-range-show-min":11.3,"weight-range-show-max":18.1,"height-range-min":38.0,"height-range-max":51.0,"life-span-range-min":13.0,"life-span-range-max":15.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":109,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":70,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":46},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/159d59c3-c1ed-5efa-a594-31f49278b73a/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/159d59c3-c1ed-5efa-a594-31f49278b73a/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/159d59c3-c1ed-5efa-a594-31f49278b73a/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/159d59c3-c1ed-5efa-a594-31f49278b73a/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/159d59c3-c1ed-5efa-a594-31f49278b73a/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/159d59c3-c1ed-5efa-a594-31f49278b73a/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/159d59c3-c1ed-5efa-a594-31f49278b73a/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/159d59c3-c1ed-5efa-a594-31f49278b73a/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/159d59c3-c1ed-5efa-a594-31f49278b73a/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/159d59c3-c1ed-5efa-a594-31f49278b73a/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/159d59c3-c1ed-5efa-a594-31f49278b73a/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/159d59c3-c1ed-5efa-a594-31f49278b73a/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/159d59c3-c1ed-5efa-a594-31f49278b73a/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/159d59c3-c1ed-5efa-a594-31f49278b73a/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/159d59c3-c1ed-5efa-a594-31f49278b73a/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/159d59c3-c1ed-5efa-a594-31f49278b73a/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/159d59c3-c1ed-5efa-a594-31f49278b73a/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/159d59c3-c1ed-5efa-a594-31f49278b73a/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"15e2ec9c-113d-512f-b551-74df0b74abaa","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/15e2ec9c-113d-512f-b551-74df0b74abaa"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"ragamuffin","name":"RagaMuffin","plural-name":null,"published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"cat","history":"The RagaMuffin's history began in the 1960s with an eccentric Southern California breeder named Ann Baker. Starting with stray cats, Ann created several breeds—including the popular Ragdoll—under the label \"Cheribum.\" Several breeders contracted with Ann as a franchise under her breeding program to further the Radgoll's development.\n\nAnn grew more unpredictable and demanding as the years went on, and disagreements about the Ragdoll breed's development began to surface. In the 1990s, some of Ann's breeders decided to splinter off and form a new group. They used a mixture of all of the Cheribum breeds as the foundation for a new breed—which they named \"RagaMuffin,\" as a nod to its street cat roots.\n\nRagaMuffins share many similarities with Ragdolls. But unlike Ragdolls, they come in almost all colors and patterns. The CFA granted the breed registration status in 2003 and Championship status in 2011.\n\nToday, the RagaMuffin's numbers remain low, with just a few dozen breeders in the United States and Europe.","facts":"RagaMuffins are calm, easy-going cats that get along with people of all ages. They form close relationships with their families, love to cuddle, and get a kick out of jumping in unattended boxes. And all that sweetness comes wrapped in a fluffy, adorable package.","traits-appearance":"The RagaMuffin is a medium-to-large cat with a substantial bone structure and sturdy body. The breed has large, expressive eyes and a cuddly, teddy bear-like appearance.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The RagaMuffin's coat is medium-long with a soft, silky texture. It's slightly longer around the neck and edges of the face, forming a ruff. The front legs are covered in thick, short-to-medium fur, and the back legs in medium-long fur. The breed's hindquarters have a wispy frill. All colors and patterns are allowed—except for pointed colors.","traits-physical":"RagaMuffins have a rounded, wedge-shaped head and a short, rounded muzzle. Their medium-sized ears tilt forward slightly and have moderate furnishings adorning the rounded tips. Their walnut-shaped eyes come in all colors and contribute to their sweet expression. And their tails are long and plumed, with a slight taper at the end.","temperament":"RagaMuffins are an excellent breed for families. They're patient, sweet-tempered cats that enjoy playing with kids and get along well with other pets. Due to their calm, supportive demeanor, they also make wonderful companions for seniors.\n\nFollowing their humans around the house and cuddling in laps are two of the RagaMuffin's favorite pastimes. Family movie night? Count them in! But don't mistake their relaxed attitude for low energy. When the toys come out, these kitties are ready to play.\n\nRagaMuffins are highly trusting and may not always properly perceive threats. So, it's best to keep them indoors.","care-nutrition":"These cats need a high-quality diet. Because nutritional needs vary for kittens, adults, and senior cats, opt for a formula that's age-appropriate for your pet.\n\nThis breed may be more prone to obesity than others. To avoid overfeeding, measure out meals and reduce portions if necessary. And don't forget to account for calories from treats in their daily totals. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of a cat's calories.\n\nFinally, all cats need access to fresh, clean water around the clock.","care-grooming":"The RagaMuffin's luxurious coat isn't prone to matting or tangles. Weekly brushing to remove dirt and loose fur is all it takes to keep your cat looking their best.\n\nMost cats' nails require monthly trimming to prevent them from getting too long. Long nails are more likely to snag on something and become torn or damaged. They can even grow into your cat's paw pads, leading to pain or infection. In addition to clipping, providing a scratching post will allow your cat to do some nail maintenance themselves (thanks to their instinct to scratch).\n\nNo grooming routine is complete without a little dental hygiene. To support your RagaMuffin's overall health, brush their teeth daily and schedule visits with your veterinarian for professional dental cleanings and exams.","care-exercise":null,"care-training":null,"care-health":"The RagaMuffin's large size may make them more prone to issues with their bones or joints. Keeping your cat at a healthy weight will save their joints from unnecessary strain. Supplements may also help improve bone or joint health, but your veterinarian is the best person to ask about this.","references":"http://www.ragamuffingroup.com/breed-history/\n\nhttps://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/cat-breeds/ragamuffin\n\nhttps://cfa.org/ragamuffin/\n\nhttps://cfa.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/ragamuffin-standard.pdf","reviewed-by":"Jamie

Street Dog","plural-name":"Ugandan Street Dogs","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"Like all dogs, the Ugandan street dog is a descendant of the gray wolf. Thousands of years ago, a number of wolves became domesticated. And over time, it became clear that these canines made valuable workers and loyal companions.\n\nAs a result, people began selectively breeding them for certain traits—a practice that led to the hundreds of purebred dogs we know and love today. But the majority of dogs around the world, including Ugandan street dogs, do not belong to a particular breed. Instead, they've evolved on their own in their native environment.\n\nThe substantial genetic diversity found in Ugandan street dogs suggests they descend from some of the oldest domesticated dogs. Experts believe livestock herders brought dogs with them from Egypt when they migrated south to Uganda. And the earliest dog remains discovered in Uganda date back to 925–1,055 YBP.\n\nToday, Ugandan street dogs survive in difficult conditions. Many people in this developing country struggle to feed and care for their families and have no resources to care for pets. But local animal welfare organizations are working to provide food, shelter, and veterinary care to the many semi-feral dogs in Uganda.","facts":"Ugandan street dogs are free-roaming pups that typically congregate in towns or villages with plentiful resources. They share many basic traits with pet dogs, but they lead primarily independent lives outdoors.","traits-appearance":"Street dogs generally tend to be medium-sized. But Ugandan street dogs can come in all shapes and sizes.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Though any combination of coat colors, patterns, and lengths is genetically possible, street dogs typically have short, brownish coats.","traits-physical":"Ugandan street dogs do not follow a breed standard—no shared set of traits links them together. That said, common characteristics of street dogs include prick ears and pointed noses.","temperament":"Street dogs must learn to fend for themselves. As a result, they tend to be scrappy, intelligent, and adaptable—all skills that support independent survival. Because they've never had to rely on humans, they may be fearful or skeptical of people who have not earned their trust.","care-nutrition":"A Ugandan street dog's diet typically consists of whatever they can kill or find—small farm animals, scraps from trash cans, handouts from kind strangers, and so on. If you're leaving food out for a street dog, they'll benefit from commercial diets formulated for pet dogs.\n\nBecause they fend for themselves, street dogs aren't usually at risk of becoming overweight. However, if you take a street dog under your roof, keep an eye on their food intake to avoid overfeeding. Guidelines on dog food packages are a good starting point when determining daily portions.","care-grooming":"If you've adopted a street dog that's comfortable being handled, regular brushing and nail trims will help them look their best. Good [dental hygiene](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) is also important for any dog. Professional cleanings and at-home dental care will keep their mouths healthy and reduce the risk of related health issues.","care-exercise":"All dogs need exercise to stay physically and mentally fit, and street dogs are no exception. Ugandan street dogs that are on their own will get adequate exercise during their daily roaming. Pet dogs, however, need access to the outdoors to stretch their legs and get mental stimulation. Playing in a fenced yard and going for leashed walks are great ways for your dog to release energy.","care-training":"Street dogs are not accustomed to obeying commands from people. In fact, many may avoid close contact with humans. Before attempting a training program, start by building trust and respect with your dog. Slow and steady is the best approach to making inroads with a street

Siamese, Burmese, and Oriental Shorthair. Many Thai breeds can trace their roots back to the original Thai landrace cat, known as the Wichien-maat (or \"Moon Diamond\" cat).\n\nSelective breeding of the Wichien-maat produced the pedigreed cats that now enjoy global popularity. But natural reproduction of these cats has continued on its own for centuries.\n\nToday, Thailand has a massive population of street cats. Though these feral cats vary in appearance, many display similar characteristics to the Wichien-maat—such as color-pointed coats and elegant, elongated bodies.\n\nLocal efforts to reduce the number of stray cats and encourage responsible pet ownership are currently underway.","facts":"Thai street cats are feral, domesticated cats that live in rural villages and cities throughout Thailand. Though not a distinct breed, many Thai street cats have evolved together over time and share genetic similarities.","traits-appearance":"Thai street cats can come in all shapes and sizes. But many share common ancestry with the Siamese.\n\nSigns of a life-long street cat—versus a stray cat who may be lost—include a clean, well-kept coat, protective body language, and lack of eye contact. Because they are intact, male street cats may have thick necks, muscular bodies, and scars from fighting.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Thai street cats' coats can come in all colors, patterns, and lengths. It's not uncommon for Thai street cats to be color-point, which means they have darker colors on the face, legs, tail, and ears.","traits-physical":"Thai street cats do not follow a breed standard. So, any combination of features is possible. That said, traditional traits of native cats from Thailand include wedge-shaped heads, long, lean bodies, large ears, and almond-shaped eyes.","temperament":"Thai street cats often live in groups and congregate near food sources and shelter. Though they may live in densely populated cities or towns, they are not typically accustomed to human contact. Many are fearful of being handled or confined. But some may adapt to interactions with people and learn to live indoors.","care-nutrition":"A Thai street cat's diet typically consists of whatever they can find—scraps from trash cans, birds and rodents, handouts from kind strangers, and so on. If you're leaving food out for a street cat, they will benefit from the same commercially prepared diets as pet cats.","care-grooming":"Street cats are typically fastidious groomers that keep their coats relatively clean. If you've taken in a street cat that will tolerate it, regular brushing and nail trims will help keep them in tip-top shape.","care-exercise":null,"care-training":null,"care-health":"Thai street cats are susceptible to the same diseases as pet cats—including rabies, distemper, feline immunodeficiency virus, and feline leukemia.

After a number of wolves became domesticated, people began depending on them to perform jobs (such as herding sheep and protecting livestock), provide companionship, or both.\n\nAs a result, people started selectively breeding dogs for certain traits—a practice that led to the hundreds of purebred dogs we know and love today. But the majority of dogs around the world—including Qatari street dogs—do not belong to a particular breed. Instead, they've evolved on their own in their native environment.\n\nToday, many semi-feral dogs exist in Qatar—some of which are sick, injured, or mistreated—and shelters and rescue organizations are overwhelmed. Local governments have recently implemented programs to vaccinate, neuter, and find homes for stray dogs.","facts":"Qatari street dogs are free-roaming pups that typically congregate in cities or towns with plentiful resources. They share many basic traits with pet dogs, but they lead primarily independent lives outdoors.","traits-appearance":"Qatari street dogs can come in all shapes and sizes. However, street dogs generally tend to be medium-sized.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Though any combination of coat colors, patterns, and lengths is genetically possible, street dogs typically have short, brownish coats.","traits-physical":"Qatari street dogs do not follow a breed standard—no set of traits links them together. That said, common characteristics of street dogs include prick ears and pointed noses.","temperament":"Street dogs must learn to fend for themselves. As a result, they tend to be scrappy, intelligent, and adaptable—all skills that support independent survival. Because they've never had to rely on humans, they may be fearful or skeptical of people who have not earned their trust.","care-nutrition":"A Qatari street dog's diet typically consists of whatever they can kill or find—small farm animals, scraps from trash cans, handouts from kind strangers, and so on. If you're leaving food out for a street dog, they'll benefit from commercial diets formulated for pet dogs.\n\nBecause they fend for themselves, street dogs aren't usually at risk of becoming overweight. However, if you take a street dog under your roof, keep an eye on their food intake to avoid overfeeding. Guidelines on dog food packages are a good starting point when determining daily portions.","care-grooming":"If you've adopted a street dog that's comfortable being handled, regular brushing and nail trims will help them look their best. Good [dental hygiene](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) is also important for any dog. Professional cleanings and at-home dental care will keep their mouths healthy and reduce the risk of related health issues.","care-exercise":"All dogs need exercise to stay physically and mentally fit, and street dogs are no exception. Qatari street dogs that are on their own will get adequate exercise during their daily roaming. Pet dogs, however, need access to the outdoors to stretch their legs and get mental stimulation. Playing in a fenced yard and going for leashed walks are great ways for your dog to release energy.","care-training":"Street dogs are not accustomed to obeying commands from people. In fact, many may avoid close contact with humans. Before attempting a training program, start by building trust and respect with your dog. Slow and steady is the best approach to making inroads with a street dog.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.dohanews.co/qatars-stray-animal-problem-what-can-be-done/\n\nhttps://www.rover.com/blog/village-dogs-around-the-world/\n\nhttps://www.companionanimalpsychology.com/2015/03/can-street-dogs-become-good-pets.html","reviewed-by":"Annette

Raven Shepherd Dog","plural-name":"Romanian Raven Shepherd Dogs","published-at":"2023-09-19T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The Romanian Raven Shepherd Dog is a landrace breed that earned its name thanks to its predominantly black coat, called “Corb” in Romanian. The breed originated in the Carpathian Mountains and the sub-Carpathian regions of south central Romania. \n\nLike other Romanian shepherd dogs, this breed served (and continues to serve) as a livestock guardian and household watchdog. These dogs play an important role in  transhumance—the seasonal movement of livestock from winter pastures to summer pastures. Under their watchful eye, flocks coexist with wolves, bears, and lynx without significant losses to either. Free-ranging Ravens are required by law to wear a dangle, or “jujău”—a stick or stave hung from a chain around the neck in front of the legs. This dangle shows that they are owned by shepherds, and discourages them from hunting wildlife. Despite being isolated to a relatively small geographical area, there is a large population of Ravens, which is a testament to their success as working dogs. \n\nThe first breed standard was written in 1987, and it is the most recently recognized native breed by the Romanian Kennel Club, in 2008. It has not yet been officially recognized by the FCI.","facts":"The Romanian Raven Shepherd Dog is one of four native livestock guardian breeds from the Carpathian Mountain region of Romania. The breed makes a calm, courageous working dog and a devoted family companion.","traits-appearance":"Romanian Raven Shepherd Dogs are large dogs with a proud, commanding presence. Male dogs are larger and stronger than females.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Raven is known for the thick black fur covering 80% or more of its body. White markings may appear on its chest, forequarters, and occasionally on the tips of its back feet. After a summer in the sun, the coat can take on a reddish tinge.\n\nThe coat itself is long, straight, and rough, with a short, dense undercoat. Longer fur around the neck forms a mane, and there are fringes on the backs of the legs.","traits-physical":"Notable traits of the Raven include a massive, well-chiseled head and broad muzzle, deep chest, muscular body, and strong legs. They have v-shaped ears that are slightly rounded at the tip, small almond-shaped eyes, and a bushy pendant tail.","temperament":"Romanian Raven Shepherd Dogs have natural guardian abilities and a booming bark, making them an ideal breed for protecting livestock from predators or watching over property. As with many watchdogs, they are skeptical of strangers but devoted to their humans. When not working, they typically make happy, playful family pets. ","care-nutrition":"Puppies may benefit from a large-breed growth diet. These specially formulated diets help prevent large dogs like the Romanian Raven Shepherd from growing too fast, which may decrease the likelihood or severity of hip dysplasia as they age. Once they reach adulthood, they thrive on high-quality dog food formulated for their age and activity level.\n\nObesity in dogs is on the rise. To help this breed maintain a healthy weight, measure their meals to avoid overfeeding and keep an eye on how many treats you give them. As a guideline, keep treats to 10% or less of their daily calories.","care-grooming":"Ravens don't generally require baths but should be brushed weekly to remove any loose fur or dirt. During periods of seasonal shedding, more frequent brushing may be required. \n\nEar cleanings to remove wax build-up and debris and regular nails trims should also be part of their grooming routine. Lastly, consistent [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) will support their long-term health. In addition to professional cleanings, establish an at-home dental care program that includes regular teeth brushing and veterinarian-recommended dental chews.","care-exercise":"This active breed needs daily exercise to stay physically fit and mentally stimulated. Long walks, opportunities to roam in an enclosed area, and backyard play sessions are great ways for them to get the exercise they need.","care-training":"Ravens are intelligent dogs that are typically submissive to their humans. To train them, use a consistent approach with plenty of positive reinforcement.\n\t\nIn addition to obedience training, all breeds will benefit from [early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) to get them comfortable with different people and environments.","care-health":null,"references":"http://www.ach.ro/2011/standarde/corb-en.pdf\n\nhttp://raceromanian.org/mountain-shepherd-dogs/raven-corb-shepherd-dogs\n\nhttp://corbi.ro/standard.html\n\nhttps://predator-friendly-ranching.blogspot.com/2018/03/wolf-collars-dangles-and-yokes.html","reviewed-by":"Casey

de Pont-Audemer","plural-name":"Spaniels de Pont-Audemer","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The Spaniel de Pont-Audemer originated in the Pont-Audemer region of France in the 19th century. The exact origins of this rare breed aren't clear. But experts believe it may have started with the crossing of Irish and English Water Spaniels. These dual-purpose dogs excelled at water work and could point and flush.\n\nAfter World War II, the breed's numbers dwindled. To prevent inbreeding, the president of the Pont-Audemer breed club in France allowed other breeds, including Irish Water Spaniels, to cross with the existing population.\n\nIn 1980, at the recommendation of the Societe Centrale Canine, the Pont-Audemer club merged with the Picardy Spaniel club. And the United Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1996.","facts":"The Spaniel de Pont-Audemer's delightful curly coat is a perfect representation of the breed's fun-loving and clownish behavior. Developed for hunting, these hard-working gun dogs also make friendly canine companions.","traits-appearance":"The Spaniel de Pont-Audemer is a hardy, large dog with a stocky build and notable curly coat.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Pont-Audemers have curly and slightly ruffled long coats. The breed has smooth hair around the face and a topknot of tight curls. Like many spaniels, these dogs may be brown or brown with white roan.","traits-physical":"This breed has a long muzzle, a somewhat pointed nose, and long, flat ears that are set low and furnished with trademark curls. Most Pont-Audemers have feathered tails similar to setters. However, some can naturally have short-haired \"rat-tails\" reminiscent of the Irish Water Spaniel.","temperament":"The Pont-Audemer is a happy, fun-loving breed with a gentle nature. Bred to hunt, these agile, adaptable dogs possess an adept sense of smell and excellent swimming and retrieving abilities. They're also known for having silly personalities and a marked sense of humor.\n\nWhen not splashing around the marshes, Pont-Audemers tend to be very affectionate companions that enjoy spending time with their people. These qualities—combined with their friendly manner around children—make them wonderful family pets. Just make sure you give your Pont-Audemer plenty of exercise and space to run. You'll both be happier for it.","care-nutrition":"Pont-Audemers do best on a diet formulated for their activity level, breed size, and life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior).\n\nCompared to other breeds, these dogs are at a greater risk for bloat (also known as twisted stomach). To help prevent this condition, break their food up into several meals a day, and use a food bowl specially designed to slow their rate of eating. When timing meals, avoid feeding them immediately before or after any vigorous activity.\n\nThese are just a few ways you can help prevent this life-threatening condition. Ask your veterinarian about other ways—including surgical options—to prevent bloat.\n\nSince all dogs are at risk for obesity, it's also important to carefully monitor your Pont-Audemer's food intake. Avoid overfeeding by using a measuring cup to portion out their meals. And don't forget, treats should make up no more than 10% of their calories.","care-grooming":"Spaniel de Pont-Audemers need their curly coats brushed regularly to prevent mats and tangles. And you should bathe them with a gentle dog shampoo when they get dirty (which may be a common occurrence if they spend a lot of time romping around in the mud and water).\n\nThe Pont-Audemer's long ears are prone to infections. So, check their ears regularly for dirt or wax build-up, and clean them as needed. Nail trims and dental cleanings should also be part of their routine care.","care-exercise":"Pont-Audemers need lots of daily exercise and mental stimulation. When not hunting, they enjoy brisk walks, hikes, or runs in the park. Swimming and games of fetch are also great activities that let them show off their natural-born talents.","care-training":"Like other spaniels, Pont-Audemers are hard-working and eager-to-please—qualities that make them relatively easy to train. These dogs respond best to positive reinforcement using treats and favorite toys.\n\nEarly socialization is also an essential part of any dog's development. Introducing your pup to different people, pets, and environments when they're young will help them grow into a well-mannered

Swiss Mountain Dog","plural-name":"Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"This large, strong breed originated with war dogs brought over the Alps by Julius Caesar’s army.\n\nThose war dogs crossed with the existing Alpine mountain dogs to create Greater Swiss Mountain Dog—or Swissies. Swissies eventually developed both the Rottweiler and Saint Bernard, and they are related closely to the Bernese Mountain Dog, as well.\n\nGreater Swiss Mountain Dogs worked as farm helpers, and their large size made them particularly adept at pulling heavy carts filled with meat and dairy.\n\nIn 1909, the Swiss Kennel Club listed the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog as a breed in the Swiss Stud Book for the first time. The first dogs of the breed came to the United States in 1968, and the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog Club of American formed. In 1995, the breed received American Kennel Club recognition.","facts":"The Greater Swiss Mountain Dog is a devoted family companion, and they prefer to be near their people at all times. They are generally friendly with new people when properly introduced, but they may be wary of strangers and, when they feel it’s warranted, will bark loudly to sound the alarm.","traits-appearance":"This powerful, heavy-boned dog is large and sturdy while still maintaining agility and swiftness essential for a working dog.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Greater Swiss Mountain Dog has a dense topcoat and a thick undercoat. Their undercoat is dark gray, light gray, and tawny, and their topcoat is black with rich rust and white markings.","traits-physical":"The Greater Swiss Mountain Dog is a large and powerful dog with a muscular appearance. They have almond-shaped, dark brown eyes and high set, triangular ears.","temperament":"This bold and loyal breed loves its people and is wary of strangers. They make excellent guard dogs.\n\nThey prefer to be with their people at all times, and their prey drive is strong, so they should always be leashed or in a secure area when outdoors. They can be strong-willed, so training might be tricky, but they tend to respond well to food-based incentives.","care-nutrition":"Your Greater Swiss Mountain Dog is a large breed that will do well with any age-appropriate, high-quality dog food that’s suited to their particular weight and any additional health concerns.\n\nAs with any dog, it’s important to monitor the amount of food and treats that you give your Greater Swiss Mountain Dog, especially since some dogs are prone to gaining weight as they age. Your veterinarian is always a good source to help provide you with appropriate nutrition and feeding guidelines.","care-grooming":"Grooming is pretty easy for this breed, whose double coat requires a weekly brush and the occasional bath.

But many people believe these smart cats came from the Russian port of Arkhangelsk (or Archangel), just south of the Arctic Circle. The weather conditions in that region would certainly explain the breed's thick, plush coat. The cats then likely hopped aboard ships and traveled with sailors to other parts of Europe.\n\nThe Russian Blue's history comes into focus in 1875—when the breed appeared at London's first cat show at the Crystal Palace. Known then as the \"Archangel Cat,\" they competed with all other blue cats. Afterward, breeders worked to develop the breed. And in 1912, Russian Blues were assigned a separate class for competition.\n\nWorld War II dealt a blow to the Russian Blue's breeding program (as it did for most breeds), and the number of cats dwindled. After the war, breeders crossed their remaining stock with blue British Shorthair or blue point Siamese to revive their breeding lines. Around this time, breeders in North America took an active interest in advancing the Russian Blue's development. So, they imported cats from Scandinavia and England and worked to develop the features of the breed we know today.","facts":"Gentle and intelligent, Russian Blues can be shy. But once humans earn their trust, they'll be waiting at the door to greet them with their trademark smile. These cats are also known for their longevity—with some Russian Blue living to the ripe old age of 25.","traits-appearance":"Russian Blues are medium-sized cats with lithe and muscular bodies. They're best known for their silvery-blue coats, emerald eyes, and smiling faces.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Russian Blue's plush double coat is short and dense, with a soft, silky texture. The breed's hair is bright blue and has silver tips that give it a shimmery appearance.","traits-physical":"Russian Blues have a wedge-shaped head and blunt muzzle. Their large, flared ears are wide at the base and serve as a frame for their face. The breed's wide-set, round eyes come in a gorgeous, vivid green color. And a long body, fine-boned legs, and dainty paws give these cats a graceful, elegant appearance.","temperament":"Russian Blues have a regal air about them. They can be shy around strangers and may take a \"wait and see\" approach to new situations (often waiting behind a couch or high on a perch). But they're devoted to the humans they deem worthy of their trust.\n\nBecause of their tentative nature, Russian Blues prefer a quiet household. And though they get along great with other pets and kids, they don't need constant companionship. They're perfectly capable of keeping themselves entertained while the family is away at work or school.\n\nFetch is a favorite activity for these playful cats. They'll frequently present toys to their humans to initiate a game and don't expect the session to end until they've had their fill. But when it's time to relax, they happily curl up in their favorite human's lap.\n\nRussian Blues also appear to be tuned into people's moods. And if they sense someone in their family is feeling down, they'll do their best to lift their spirits.","care-nutrition":"Russian Blues require a high-quality diet. Because nutritional needs vary for kittens, adults, and senior cats, opt for a formula that's age-appropriate for your pet.\n\nTo help your cat stay at a healthy weight, monitor their food amount and reduce portions if necessary. And don't forget to account for snacks in their overall calories. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of a cat's daily intake.\n\nFinally, keep in mind that all cats need easy access to fresh, clean water at all times.","care-grooming":"Despite their plush coats, Russian Blues aren't heavy shedders. So, weekly brushing is usually enough to keep their coats looking and feeling great.\n\nMonthly nail trims can help keep your cat's nails from growing too long, snagging on something, and becoming torn or damaged. (Plus, overgrown nails can grow into their paw pads, leading to pain or infection.) And providing a scratching post will allow your cat to do a little nail maintenance themselves—and satisfy their instinct to scratch.\n\nNo cat care routine is complete without dental care. From a young age, start your Russian Blue on a dental routine that includes at-home teeth brushing and professional exams and cleanings.","care-exercise":null,"care-training":null,"care-health":"Roughly one out of every three cats in the United States is overweight or obese.

To help them maintain a healthy weight, keep a careful eye on their food intake—including treats. As a rule, treats should make up no more than 10% of their calories.","care-grooming":"The Russian Hound's grooming needs are relatively minimal. The breed's short coat needs brushing once or twice a week to remove loose or dead hair. Ear cleanings, nails trims, and regular teeth brushing are also essential elements of any dog's home-care routine.","care-exercise":"Russian Hounds are active and energetic dogs, and they should get at least an hour of exercise a day. Besides long walks and hikes, this breed likes to run and play with family or other dogs in a fenced back yard.","care-training":"Like many hounds, the Russian Hound is an intelligent dog that can have a stubborn streak. As such, the breed responds best to positive reinforcement using treats or favorite toys as rewards.

Israel, and parts of bordering countries.\n\nDogs that look similar to Canaans appear on artifacts from 4,000 years ago, although it’s unclear exactly when the breed came into existence. Canaan history changed in the year 70 when Israelites were driven out by the Romans, and their dogs, with nowhere to go and no one to care for them, traveled into the Negev Desert. They survived there, without the help of humans, until the 20th century.\n\nWhen the Israeli army needed dogs to act as sentries on patrol, Dr. Rudolphina Menzel proposed using the dogs that were, presumably, adapted to the area. That led to the reintroduction of the Canaan breed and humans.\n\nThe Canaan Dog quickly earned their stay and proved worthwhile as working dogs, and so after World War II, Dr. Menzel began a program to train and breed the dogs as guide dogs for the blind. These days, Canaan dogs make excellent competitors for dog sports and make even better companion pets.","facts":"The Canaan Dog—the national dog of Israel—has a fascinating history that has helped it evolve the traits that are characteristic of the dog today. They are sensitive and affectionate with their family, but they can be territorial and wary of strangers or new things because of their background. Proper training and socialization are essential for this breed.","traits-appearance":"The Canaan Dog is a medium-sized breed with a short coat in solid or pied colors, and a curled, brush tail.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Canaan Dog has an inner coat that’s soft and short, and an outer coat that is straight, harsh, and medium length. The coat is shorter on the legs and head and longer on the ruff, tail, back of the thigh, and top of the withers.\n\nCanaan Dogs come in two primary color patterns that are either predominantly white with a mask and with or without additional patches of color, or solid colored, with or without white trim.\n\nThey can range in color from black to multiple shades to brown, including sandy, red, or liver.","traits-physical":"The Canaan Dog may have a symmetrical mask either over the eyes and ears or over the entire head, particularly if the rest of the dog is predominantly white. In general, this breed has a clean outline with a wedge-shaped head, low-set, erect ears, and a high-set brush tail that curls.","temperament":"Devoted and gentle with their family, the Canaan Dog can be highly territorial and aloof with strangers. They can also be noisy, although they are generally easy to train.\n\nProper, [early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) is critical for Canaan Dogs.","care-nutrition":"As with most active breeds, the Canaan Dog does best with high-quality dog food that’s suited to their particular age, as well as any additional health concerns.\n\nIt’s important to monitor the amount of food and treats that you give your Canaan Dog, especially since some dogs may be prone to gaining weight as they age. Your veterinarian is always a good source to help provide you with appropriate nutrition and feeding guidelines.","care-grooming":"The Canaan Dog’s double coat sheds at least once a year, and brushing every few days during this time will help keep it healthy. Other than that, a once-weekly brushing should keep this dog’s coat in good shape.\n\nAll dogs require regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care), including at-home teeth brushing and professional dental cleanings, and the Canaan Dog is no exception. Maintaining good dental hygiene is important for their overall long-term health.","care-exercise":"The Canaan Dog is an active breed that requires moderate exercise each day to stay healthy and happy. They are highly trainable, and so they do well with dog sports like tracking and herding. And daily walks will keep them happy, too. Remember to always keep this breed on a leash or in a secure, fenced-in area.","care-training":"Early training and [socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) with this breed are important since they're territorial and can be wary of strange people, strange dogs, and new things.\n\nAlthough the breed is intelligent and can learn things quickly, they can also be stubborn and independent. Once you figure out a good training technique, Canaan Dogs are highly trainable for dog sports like agility and tracking.","care-health":null,"references":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NhwrItS3_E3xuTOpg7Ib7AfJVDT_0GVU/view\n\nhttps://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/canaan-dog/\n\nhttp://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/Canaan_Dog.pdf\n\nhttp://cdca.org/FAQ.html","reviewed-by":"Cindy Elston, DVM, MPH","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":16.3,"weight-range-pet-max":29.0,"weight-range-show-min":17.7,"weight-range-show-max":24.9,"height-range-min":48.0,"height-range-max":61.0,"life-span-range-min":12.0,"life-span-range-max":15.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":97,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":58,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":36},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1baf28e0-9053-5979-b66b-1d9ab2059e8a/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1baf28e0-9053-5979-b66b-1d9ab2059e8a/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1baf28e0-9053-5979-b66b-1d9ab2059e8a/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1baf28e0-9053-5979-b66b-1d9ab2059e8a/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1baf28e0-9053-5979-b66b-1d9ab2059e8a/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1baf28e0-9053-5979-b66b-1d9ab2059e8a/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1baf28e0-9053-5979-b66b-1d9ab2059e8a/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1baf28e0-9053-5979-b66b-1d9ab2059e8a/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1baf28e0-9053-5979-b66b-1d9ab2059e8a/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1baf28e0-9053-5979-b66b-1d9ab2059e8a/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1baf28e0-9053-5979-b66b-1d9ab2059e8a/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1baf28e0-9053-5979-b66b-1d9ab2059e8a/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1baf28e0-9053-5979-b66b-1d9ab2059e8a/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1baf28e0-9053-5979-b66b-1d9ab2059e8a/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1baf28e0-9053-5979-b66b-1d9ab2059e8a/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1baf28e0-9053-5979-b66b-1d9ab2059e8a/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1baf28e0-9053-5979-b66b-1d9ab2059e8a/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1baf28e0-9053-5979-b66b-1d9ab2059e8a/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"1bd2c6a9-a0f6-5553-90ad-6323bd520e7a","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1bd2c6a9-a0f6-5553-90ad-6323bd520e7a"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"german-wirehaired-pointer","name":"German Wirehaired Pointer","plural-name":"German Wirehaired Pointers","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The German Wirehaired Pointer, also known as the Deutsch Drahtaar, received official recognition in its German homeland in the 1920s.\n\nUnlike British gamesmen—who were breeding specialized dogs that excelled in specific types of hunting—hunters of Continental Europe wanted breeds that could do it all. Breeders combined the Griffon, Stichelhaar, Pudelpointer, and [German Shorthaired Pointer](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/german-shorthaired-pointer)—each of which came about in the late 1800s. The resulting dogs could point and track game, retrieve waterfowl from land or water, confront vermin, and more.\n\nThe German Wirehaired Pointer came to the United States in the early 1920s and received American Kennel Club recognition in 1959. Though the breed isn't too popular in the U.S., it has a large following in Germany.","facts":"The German Wirehaired Pointer is a smart, energetic breed with a distinctively bushy beard and eyebrows. These dogs make loyal, enthusiastic, and handsome hunting companions and family pets.","traits-appearance":"German Wirehaired Pointers are muscled, sturdy dogs best known for their weather-resistant, wire-like coats, bushy beards, and eyebrows.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The German Wirehaired Pointer's coat is both functional and distinctive. The harsh, wiry outer coat is weather-resistant and somewhat water-repellant. During the winter, the undercoat is dense enough to protect the GWP from the cold. In the summer months, this undercoat thins out significantly.\n\nThe GWP's coat is liver or parti-color with white—including patches and ticking. Its head is always liver-color, though a white blaze is possible.","traits-physical":"German Wirehaired Pointers have medium-sized, oval, brown eyes. They're bright, clear, and—most notably—overhung with medium length eyebrows. The breed's ears are rounded (but not too broad) and hang close to the head. The tail is set high and carried in line or above the body when the dog is alert.","temperament":"The German Wirehaired Pointer is an excellent breed for active people and families looking for an affectionate, loyal, high-energy pet.\n\nFar from couch potatoes, German Wirehaired Pointers need plenty of outdoor exercise to be happy. A bored GWP can easily turn to a destructive one. Giving them \"jobs\" to do around the house will help keep them from destructive behaviors, such as barking or digging.\n\nGerman Wirehaired Pointers form tight bonds with their people. If they live in a home with only one person, they may turn into a one-person dog. But if raised among family, they will bond with the whole group. More than anything, GWPs enjoy human companionship and want to be included in activities as much as possible.\n\nThis breed is usually friendly toward other pets. But because of their sporting dog heritage, German Wirehaired Pointers often chase wildlife. Though sometimes aloof with strangers, they make commendable watch dogs.","care-nutrition":"To meet the nutritional needs of your German Wirehaired Pointer, feed a high-quality food that's appropriate for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior) and activity level.\n\nKeep them at a healthy weight by monitoring their food intake and measuring out meals. And don't forget to account for treats in their daily calorie totals. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of a dog's calories.","care-grooming":"The German Wirehaired Pointer's grooming needs are relatively low-maintenance. Weekly brushing with a comb and soft slicker brush is usually enough to keep their coats free of loose hair and dirt.\n\nYou should clip your dog's nails regularly to keep them short and tidy. Overgrown nails can split and become painful, or lead to issues walking or running.\n\nIn addition to professional dental cleanings, aim to establish an at-home dental care routine that includes regular teeth brushing. Maintaining good [dental hygiene](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) is essential for the overall long-term health of all dogs.","care-exercise":"German Wirehaired Pointers are busy dogs that have higher exercise needs than many other breeds. Long daily walks, playtime in enclosed yards, hiking, and swimming are all outdoor activities that they enjoy.\n\nThanks to their background, GWPs love to hunt and retrieve. Throwing a tennis ball or frisbee for them to retrieve provides exercise and lets them show off their natural abilities.\n\nGerman Wirehaired Pointers also enjoy participating in dog sports such as field trials, tracking, agility, and competitive obedience. These mentally stimulating activities can give your dog a productive outlet for their energy.","care-training":"German Wirehaired Pointers are responsive and extremely eager to please. Such characteristics make them relatively easy to train. However, they can have an independent streak and will sometimes only work for someone they like.\n\nStarting from an early age, consistent, firm training and positive reinforcement techniques are the best tools for success.

And no one really knows the full story behind the breed's origins. Poodles are likely related to the [Portguese Water Dog](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/portuguese-water-dog) and [Irish Water Spaniel](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/irish-water-spaniel). Some experts believe they originated in Central Europe or Russia, while others think they got their start in Spain or Portugal. Another common theory is that German soldiers brought the Poodle to France during the 1400s.\n\nRegardless of the breed's exact beginnings, everyone agrees that Poodles were bred for bird hunting and water retrieval. And their love of water is how they got their name. \"Poodle\" comes from an old German word meaning \"to splash about.\"\n\nWhat's the deal with the famous Poodle haircut? Hunters knew that Poodles would be more efficient swimmers if they had less hair. But less hair would leave them more vulnerable to the cold water. So, creative Poodle owners had an idea. They shaved most of the dog's body but strategically left puffs of hair to protect joints and vital organs from the cold. Problem solved.\n\nIn the 1700s, Standard Poodles were bred down to smaller sizes. Today, the Standard Poodle, [Medium Poodle](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/poodle-medium), [Miniature Poodle](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/poodle-miniature), and [Toy Poodle](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/poodle-toy) all share the same breed standard.","facts":"The Standard Poodle is a calm, smart, sensitive breed that makes a great jogging buddy, family dog, and (if properly coiffed) fashion statement. Standard Poodles were so popular that breeders ultimately created the Medium, Miniature, and Toy Poodle varieties.","traits-appearance":"The Standard Poodle is an elegant, well-proportioned breed with a frizzy and curly coat.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Standard Poodle's dense coat can be curly (frizzy curls over the whole body) or corded (even cords that hang in varying lengths). Poodle owners often give their pups stylized haircuts or a \"puppy clip\" that trims hair to an even length over the whole body.\n\nPoodles come in a wide range of colors—including solid blacks, grays, silvers, browns, apricots, creams, and shading variations.","traits-physical":"The Standard Poodle has dark, oval-shaped eyes that offer an alert, intelligent expression. Covered in long, wavy hair, the ears are long enough to reach the corner of the lip when pulled forward.","temperament":"The Standard Poodle is an incredibly smart, playful, and—to the surprise of many—athletic breed. Typically friendly, Poodles get along well with kids, dogs, and other pets.\n\nStandard Poodles love people and form tight bonds with their families. And because of their sensitive nature, they even pick up on the moods of people they're close to. This intuitive nature—combined with a willingness to please—makes the Poodle a great assistance and therapy dog.\n\nPoodles may bark, and some are reserved around strangers. But [early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) can help prevent these and other undesirable behaviors.","care-nutrition":"Standard Poodles need a dog food formulated for their specific life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). Diets developed specifically for Poodles are a great option to explore.\n\nTo prevent your Poodle from becoming overweight, keep an eye on their food portions. And be sure to take treats into account when tracking their daily calorie intake. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of a dog's calories.","care-grooming":"Standard Poodles have hair instead of fur. That means—unlike fur coats that grow to a point and then shed—a Poodle's hair keeps growing. Similar to human hair, this breed's hair does still fall out. But it usually falls back into their coats (instead of all over the house). Because of this minimal shedding, Poodles are an excellent breed for people with allergies.\n\nThough Standard Poodles don't shed a lot, their coats still need regular grooming. To keep their hair free from mats and tangles, brush a few times a week. And because their hair grows continuously, plan on haircuts every month or so.\n\nIn addition to professional dental cleanings, Standard Poodles need an at-home dental care routine that includes regular teeth brushing.\n\nMaintaining good [dental hygiene](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) is essential for the overall long-term health of all dogs.","care-exercise":"A very active breed, the Standard Poodle enjoys all the same activities as other dogs in the sporting group. Long walks, jogs, agility, retrieving, rally, and swimming are fun ways for a Poodle to burn off energy. Or for something a little different, try musical canine freestyle—a mix of obedience training, dance, and tricks.","care-training":"Standard Poodles are very bright dogs, and therefore easy to train. Because they're so responsive and eager to please, reward-based training using treats or favorite toys is the best approach with these pups.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/lifestyle/10-facts-about-poodles/\n\nhttp://www.fci.be/Nomenclature/Standards/172g09-en.pdf\n\nhttp://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/Poodle.pdf\n\nhttps://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/dog-breeds/miniature-poodle\n\nhttp://www.allpoodleinfo.com/poodle-temperament","reviewed-by":"Annette Louviere, DVM","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":19.1,"weight-range-pet-max":31.3,"weight-range-show-min":20.0,"weight-range-show-max":29.5,"height-range-min":38.0,"height-range-max":60.0,"life-span-range-min":10.0,"life-span-range-max":15.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":92,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":55,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":37},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1c22204b-60a4-506e-93d4-c6bfb9352da9/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1c22204b-60a4-506e-93d4-c6bfb9352da9/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1c22204b-60a4-506e-93d4-c6bfb9352da9/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1c22204b-60a4-506e-93d4-c6bfb9352da9/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1c22204b-60a4-506e-93d4-c6bfb9352da9/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1c22204b-60a4-506e-93d4-c6bfb9352da9/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1c22204b-60a4-506e-93d4-c6bfb9352da9/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1c22204b-60a4-506e-93d4-c6bfb9352da9/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1c22204b-60a4-506e-93d4-c6bfb9352da9/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1c22204b-60a4-506e-93d4-c6bfb9352da9/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1c22204b-60a4-506e-93d4-c6bfb9352da9/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1c22204b-60a4-506e-93d4-c6bfb9352da9/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1c22204b-60a4-506e-93d4-c6bfb9352da9/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1c22204b-60a4-506e-93d4-c6bfb9352da9/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1c22204b-60a4-506e-93d4-c6bfb9352da9/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1c22204b-60a4-506e-93d4-c6bfb9352da9/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1c22204b-60a4-506e-93d4-c6bfb9352da9/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1c22204b-60a4-506e-93d4-c6bfb9352da9/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"1d10a61b-5c32-5e05-b1b1-48630dff810f","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1d10a61b-5c32-5e05-b1b1-48630dff810f"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"cirneco-del-etna","name":"Cirneco dell'Etna","plural-name":"Cirnechi dell'Etna","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"Dating back to 500 B.C., these sighthounds have been hunting small game like hare and partridge for thousands of years. Thought to have migrated to Sicily with the Phoenicians, these dogs have held a prominent place in ancient Greek and Italian culture, often depicted on antique coins.\n\nThough Cirneci had almost gone extinct by the early 20th century, in 1930 a Sicilian baroness spent the next 26 years reviving the beautiful breed. Only recently recognized by the AKC in 2015, the Cirneco still holds a high esteem position in their native Italy.","facts":"A breed of great antiquity, the Cirneco (“cheer-NEK-o”) is a sleek and agile hunter from the island of Sicily, particularly present in the area surrounding Mount Etna. They have pointed, alert ears atop a lithe, tall, athletic frame. Cirneci look very similar to their cousins, the Pharaoh Hounds, just tinier in stature.","traits-appearance":"Carrying the characteristic curves associated with all sighthounds, Cirneci are born to run. Capable of incredible bursts of speed, these durable and resilient hounds stand between 16 and 22 inches, making them a medium-sized hound.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Coming in a range of tans from light to dark, they may have white patches on their head, chest, and feet. Cirneci have a smooth, fine, short coat that gets a little longer along the body.","traits-physical":"The Cirnechi have large, upright ears that make them look like they are always scanning their environment, ready to sprint off at a moment’s notice. Their spindly legs and fine build display the same speedy structure as all sighthounds.","temperament":"Loving and loyal family pets, Cirnechi make wonderful companions. Don’t be fooled by their delicate frames, they are powerful and speedy hunters that make wonderful coursing dogs.\n\nConsidered easier to train then most hounds, they are kind and adoring companions. Cirneci have their own unique personality and will bring a bright, positive energy to any family. ","care-nutrition":"Cirneco dell'Etnas require a high-quality dog food that is age-appropriate—whether it’s commercially manufactured or homemade (with a veterinarian’s supervision and approval). It’s important to monitor the amount of food you give your Cirneco dell'Etna. Reduce the portions or restrict calories if your pup gains weight. Your veterinarian is always a good source to provide you with appropriate nutrition and feeding guidelines.","care-grooming":"Ears are the main concern for the Cirneci, and they need to be checked weekly for build-up and dirt. They only require a light brushing weekly, and their coat is typically easy to maintain. Nails need to be clipped, if they aren’t kept short with exercise.\n\nAll dogs require regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care), including at-home teeth brushing and professional dental cleanings, and Cirneco dell’Etna is no exception. Maintaining good dental hygiene is important for their overall long-term health.","care-exercise":"Regular walks and play with human companions are essential. They adore their human partners and want to spend time with them whenever possible. Tapping into their hunting instinct, this breed excels at dog sports and following their desire for the chase.","care-training":"As with most sighthounds, they respond to positive, gentle training methods. While they have an independent air to them, they love their families and can be successfully trained. Keep them on a leash when not in a fenced area, since they can and will chase any small, furry quarry that crosses their path.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/cirneco-delletna/\n\nhttp://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/CirnecodellEtna.pdf\n\nhtps://cirneco.org/breed/","reviewed-by":"Annette Louviere, DVM","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":7.7,"weight-range-pet-max":11.8,"weight-range-show-min":7.7,"weight-range-show-max":11.8,"height-range-min":43.0,"height-range-max":51.0,"life-span-range-min":12.0,"life-span-range-max":14.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":98,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":58,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":40},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1d10a61b-5c32-5e05-b1b1-48630dff810f/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1d10a61b-5c32-5e05-b1b1-48630dff810f/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1d10a61b-5c32-5e05-b1b1-48630dff810f/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1d10a61b-5c32-5e05-b1b1-48630dff810f/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1d10a61b-5c32-5e05-b1b1-48630dff810f/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1d10a61b-5c32-5e05-b1b1-48630dff810f/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1d10a61b-5c32-5e05-b1b1-48630dff810f/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1d10a61b-5c32-5e05-b1b1-48630dff810f/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1d10a61b-5c32-5e05-b1b1-48630dff810f/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1d10a61b-5c32-5e05-b1b1-48630dff810f/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1d10a61b-5c32-5e05-b1b1-48630dff810f/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1d10a61b-5c32-5e05-b1b1-48630dff810f/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1d10a61b-5c32-5e05-b1b1-48630dff810f/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1d10a61b-5c32-5e05-b1b1-48630dff810f/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1d10a61b-5c32-5e05-b1b1-48630dff810f/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1d10a61b-5c32-5e05-b1b1-48630dff810f/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1d10a61b-5c32-5e05-b1b1-48630dff810f/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1d10a61b-5c32-5e05-b1b1-48630dff810f/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"1dc42f04-2485-5f9b-b053-7f4d52f05dd3","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1dc42f04-2485-5f9b-b053-7f4d52f05dd3"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"papillon","name":"Papillon","plural-name":"Papillons ","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The Papillon is one of the oldest toy breeds, with a history dating back 700 years. These little dogs traveled on trade routes between Asia and Europe, serving as \"lap warmers\" for noblewomen in France and Spain. Papillons appeared in historic portraits and paintings of queens and princesses. Famous artists such as Rembrandt, Goya, and Rubens also included Papillons in their artwork.\n\nPapillons were developed by crossing existing toy breeds with spaniels, and they retained traits from all. They got their name—which means \"butterfly\" in French—because of their trademark butterfly ears.","facts":"The Papillon is a friendly, alert, and happy breed. These tiny dogs are also natural athletes that love high-energy play sessions with their owners.","traits-appearance":"The Papillon is a toy breed with an elegant bone structure and dainty gait. But they're most known for their unique, butterfly-like ears.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Papillons have long, silky, flowing hair that lies flat on their back and sides. Their ears are well-fringed, and their tails covered with long, flowing plumes.\n\nTheir coats come in either parti-color or white with patches of any color—with black, lemon, red, sable, and tan being the most common.","traits-physical":"Papillons are fine-boned dogs that are slightly more long than tall. They have small heads, thin muzzles, dark, round, medium-sized eyes, and alert expressions.\n\nThe butterfly-like ears that gave the breed its name may either be erect or dropped. In both cases, the ears are large with rounded tips and set on the side of the head, toward the back. Erect ears move like butterfly wings. The drop ears, known as the Phalene, are carried drooping and must be held completely down.\n\nIn Europe, Papillons with Phalene ears are a separate breed called the Continental Toy Spaniel.","temperament":"Papillons are happy, alert, and friendly. These dogs are more robust than they appear and can easily adapt to hot or cold climates. They can also happily live in big cities or wide-open spaces.\n\nBred as companion dogs, Papillons want to spend time with their family above all else. Left alone for too long, Papillons may develop undesirable behaviors. A second pet in the home may be enough to comfort a Papillon whose family is at work all day.\n\nPapillons are great pets for families—including children—but may be shy around strangers. For this reason, [socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) is recommended to reduce defensive, aggressive tendencies.\n\nTrue to the little dog stereotype, some Papillons can be a bit yappy. Though training may help curb their barking, apartments with shared walls may not be the best environment for this breed.","care-nutrition":"Papillons require a high-quality dog food appropriate for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior) and small size. To keep them at a healthy weight, monitor their food intake carefully. Portion out their meals with a measuring cup and limit treats to no more than 10% of their daily calories.","care-grooming":"Maintaining a Papillon's beautiful coat is relatively easy. Brush it once a week, giving extra attention to areas with longer hair, as those are more prone to matting. These areas include the insides of their hind legs, behind their ears, and around their thighs and buttocks.\n\nPapillons have fast-growing nails that require regular trimming. Overgrown nails can split, crack, or make it painful to walk or run. Their dew claws may curl around and pierce their legs if not maintained.\n\nStart a regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) routine when Papillons are young. Brushing their teeth and scheduling professional cleanings ensures good oral hygiene throughout their lives.","care-exercise":"Papillons are moderately active dogs that love accompanying their people on adventures. Whether it's an occasional walk around the block, trip to the dog park, or play session in a fenced yard, Papillons appreciate opportunities to burn off some energy.\n\nPapillons require mental and physical stimulation. Games and puzzle toys will keep this intelligent breed engaged and active. They also enjoy activities such as competitive obedience or agility, and consistently rank among the top breeds in the sport.","care-training":"Papillons are intelligent and eager to please, a combination that makes them easy to train. A consistent training program that uses positive reinforcement can provide the right foundation to teach basic commands and new tricks.\n\nLike other small breeds, it may take extra time for Papillons to master housetraining. Consistency (and patience) are key. Regular socialization is also essential to make Papillons feel comfortable with unfamiliar people, pets, and places.","care-health":null,"references":"http://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/Papillon.pdf\n\nhttps://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/dog-breeds/papillon","reviewed-by":"Annette Louviere, DVM","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":1.8,"weight-range-pet-max":5.4,"weight-range-show-min":1.8,"weight-range-show-max":4.5,"height-range-min":20.0,"height-range-max":28.0,"life-span-range-min":12.0,"life-span-range-max":16.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":86,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":60,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":43},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1dc42f04-2485-5f9b-b053-7f4d52f05dd3/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1dc42f04-2485-5f9b-b053-7f4d52f05dd3/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1dc42f04-2485-5f9b-b053-7f4d52f05dd3/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1dc42f04-2485-5f9b-b053-7f4d52f05dd3/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1dc42f04-2485-5f9b-b053-7f4d52f05dd3/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1dc42f04-2485-5f9b-b053-7f4d52f05dd3/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1dc42f04-2485-5f9b-b053-7f4d52f05dd3/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1dc42f04-2485-5f9b-b053-7f4d52f05dd3/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1dc42f04-2485-5f9b-b053-7f4d52f05dd3/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1dc42f04-2485-5f9b-b053-7f4d52f05dd3/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1dc42f04-2485-5f9b-b053-7f4d52f05dd3/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1dc42f04-2485-5f9b-b053-7f4d52f05dd3/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1dc42f04-2485-5f9b-b053-7f4d52f05dd3/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1dc42f04-2485-5f9b-b053-7f4d52f05dd3/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1dc42f04-2485-5f9b-b053-7f4d52f05dd3/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1dc42f04-2485-5f9b-b053-7f4d52f05dd3/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1dc42f04-2485-5f9b-b053-7f4d52f05dd3/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1dc42f04-2485-5f9b-b053-7f4d52f05dd3/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"1e01cd53-a818-5866-ab75-146a7345fdb0","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1e01cd53-a818-5866-ab75-146a7345fdb0"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"siamese-and-oriental-shorthair","name":"Siamese and Oriental Shorthair","plural-name":null,"published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"cat","history":"Though legends abound, no one knows the exact origins of the Siamese breed. But cats fitting the description of Siamese appear in manuscripts dating back to the 12th century. Many experts believe these cats lived in palaces with the royalty of Siam (now Thailand).\n\nSiamese cats were exported to England toward the end of the 19th century and appeared in the Crystal Palace Cat Show in 1871. The breed's American debut came eight years later—when the U.S. Consul from Bangkok gifted a Siamese to President Rutherford B. Hayes' wife.\n\nAs awareness of these beautiful cats spread, fanciers in the United States jumped on the chance to import them. The Siamese appeared in the Beresford Cat Club Stud Books in 1900 and was one of the inaugural breeds accepted by the Cat Fanciers Association in 1906.\n\nBy the 1930s, these fashionably colored cats had become American favorites. But quality suffered as breeders rushed to meet the demand, and the number of cats whose features strayed from the breed standard grew. Fortunately, breeders dedicated to the Siamese have successfully revived the ancient breed's original beauty.\n\nCat breeding saw a dramatic decline during World War II. As breeders started up again after the war, they experimented with unique crosses that yielded many modern cat breeds—including the Oriental Shorthair.\n\nIn the 1950s, breeders crossed Russian Blues, British Shorthairs, Abyssinians, and regular domestic cats with the Siamese. These litters were then bred with Siamese, which produced pointed and non-pointed kittens. In just a few generations, these cats were indistinguishable from the Siamese, except for their coloring. And the non-pointed cats from these breedings formed the foundation of the Oriental breed.\n\nToday, Siamese and Oriental Shorthairs enjoy a reputation as fun-loving, affectionate pets wrapped in elegant, artistic packages.","facts":"Siamese and Oriental Shorthairs both belong to the Siamese breed group. These playful, extroverted kitties love to be the center of attention. They're chatty cats that want nothing more than to follow their humans around and tell them all about their day.","traits-appearance":"Siamese and Orientals are medium-sized cats known for their long, lean bodies and exquisitely refined appearance.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Siamese and Orientals Shorthairs have short, glossy coats that lie close to the body. As pointed cats, Siamese have lighter-colored bodies and darker colors on their face, legs, tail, and ears. The light-colored hair on their bodies usually darkens with age. Still, there is always a strong contrast between body color and points. Points on the mask, ears, legs, feet, and tail are dense, clearly defined, and all the same shade.\n\nThe Siamese coat comes in four different colors: Seal point (pale cream bodies and dark brown points), chocolate point (ivory bodies and milk chocolate points), blue point (bluish-white bodies and deep blue points), and lilac point (glacial white bodies and frosty grey, pinkish points).\n\nUnder the breed standard, all coat patterns and colors—including solid, shaded, smoke, parti-color, bi-color, pointed, or tabby patterned—are possible.","traits-physical":"Siamese and Orientals have long, tapering wedge-shaped heads and flat skulls. Their massive, pointed ears are wide at the base. And they have a long, straight nose and a wedge-shaped muzzle.\n\nSiamese have vivid blue, almond-shaped eyes that slant toward the nose—one of the breed's most distinguishing features. Orientals' eyes are typically blue, green, or one of each.\n\nBoth breeds have slender necks, svelte bodies, slim legs, thin, tapering tails, and small, dainty paws.","temperament":"Siamese and Orientals are great breeds for people looking for an engaging, social, curious cat. They thrive on companionship and love being around their family—including other pets and kids. In fact, they can be rather demanding if they don't receive the attention they crave. Some pet parents get them in pairs so they'll entertain each other when the family is away.\n\nBoth Siamese and Orientals are extremely talkative and capable of producing a variety of sounds. If you think you hear a baby crying in the other room, it might just be your cat trying to get your attention with one of their legendary vocal tricks.\n\nThese playful breeds love toys and are always up for a game of fetch (especially since it gives them a chance to engage with their people). If left alone with an interactive toy, they'll entertain themselves for hours.\n\nAfter a full day, these kitties are happy to snuggle in for a cozy nap. Preferred sleeping spots include a warm lap, under the covers with their favorite person, or in a heap with other feline friends.","care-nutrition":"Siamese and Orientals require a high-quality diet formulated for their life stage (e.g., kitten, adult, senior). Consider foods that account for breed-specific needs. For example, some diets have high protein and moderate fat to maintain your cat's lean, muscular body. And others use kibble designed to prevent cats from eating too quickly and experiencing stomach upset.\n\nObesity is a health concern for all cats. To keep calories in check and prevent weight gain, measure out your cat's meals and keep an eye on how many treats you're giving them. Just one small piece of cheese can account for half their recommended daily calories. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of their calories.\n\nIn addition to meals, make sure your cat has access to fresh, clean water at all times.","care-grooming":"Siamese and Orientals are good self-groomers, and their short coats are relatively low-maintenance. Still, it's a good idea to brush them every week to remove loose hair. (Plus, they adore the attention that comes with a grooming session.)\n\nYou should also trim your cat's claws regularly to keep them from getting too long. Long nails are more likely to snag on something and become torn or damaged. Overgrown nails can also cause pain or infection in your cat's paw pads or lead to difficulty walking or using the litter box.\n\nFinally, dental care is essential to every cat's lifelong health. When yours is young, start them on a dental health routine that includes at-home teeth brushing and professional exams and cleanings.","care-exercise":null,"care-training":null,"care-health":"Some breeds are more susceptible to certain health conditions. Siamese and Oriental Shorthairs may be prone to Amyloidosis—a disease caused by a build-up of an abnormal protein in the heart, liver, kidney, or other organs. They can also be sensitive to anesthesia. Your veterinarian is your best resource for discussing these and other health concerns for your cat.","references":"https://www.tica.org/breeds/browse-all-breeds?view=article&id=1227:the-siamese-breed&catid=48\n\nhttps://cfa.org/siamese/\n\nhttps://cfa.org/siamese/siamese-article-2000/\n\nhttps://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/cat-breeds/siamese\n\nhttps://cfa.org/oriental/\n\nhttps://www.tica.org/breeds/browse-all-breeds?view=article&id=863:oriental-shorthair-breed&catid=79\n\nhttps://cfa.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/oriental-standard.pdf\n\nhttps://www.royalcanin.com/us/cats/breeds/breed-library/siamese\n\nhttps://www.royalcanin.com/us/cats/products/retail-products/siamese-adult-dry-cat-food\n\nhttps://www.banfield.com/pet-healthcare/pet-healthcare-resources/nutrition/food-amounts-and-helping-prevent-obesity","reviewed-by":"Annette

Inu","plural-name":"Shiba Inu","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"A Japanese breed from 300 B.C., the Shiba Inu served hunters by flushing out birds and tracking game—including wild boar. (In Japanese, \"shiba\" means brushwood, and \"inu\" means dog.) But the breed's faithful, affectionate personality earned it a spot as a prized domestic dog.\n\nThough once nearly extinct, Shiba Inus bounced back to become the most popular dog breed in Japan. The 1936 Cultural Properties Act declared the Shiba Inu a precious natural product of Japan. The Shiba Inu came to the United States in the 1950s, where it also quickly gained popularity.","facts":"This ancient breed got its start as a hunting dog. But the Shiba Inu has since become the most popular companion dog in Japan. Active, attentive, and adaptable, Shiba Inus excel as energetic guard dogs and loyal friends.","traits-appearance":"The Shibu Inu is both the oldest and the smallest dog native to Japan. The alert, agile breed has a compact, muscular frame and a confident gaze. These dogs move lightly and gracefully.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"A double-coated breed, the Shiba Inu has a soft, thick undercoat and straight, stiff outer coat. Its hair stands up to two inches at the withers, with the tail hair being longer and fanning out in a brush.\n\nShiba Inus come in three colors: bright orange-red, black with tan points, and sesame. The undercoat is cream, buff, or gray. For show competition, Shiba Inus that are black with tan points must have a brownish cast, and borders between the black and tan areas should be well-defined. Shiba Inus with sesame coloring (a rich red background with black-tipped hairs) should have no significant concentrations of black, and sesame areas must be at least half red.\n\nOn all three color patterns, \"urajiro\" is required for show. This cream-to-white undersurface coloring must be present on the sides of the muzzle, cheeks, underjaw, upper throat, abdomen, insides of the ears and legs, and around the ventral side of the tail.","traits-physical":"The Shiba Inu has a broad forehead with a slight furrow, deep-set eyes with outer edges that slant upward, and triangular, pricked ears that tilt forward.","temperament":"Shibas are independent and reserved with strangers. But with family, the breed is affectionate and loyal. These active, energetic dogs appreciate plenty of activity. And when they get it, they tend to be calm and well-mannered at home.\n\nAn adaptable breed, the Shiba Inu, will enjoy hiking in the backwoods as much as walking down crowded urban sidewalks—as long as it's with its people. Shibas can develop separation anxiety if left alone for too long. Shiba Inus have sharp senses, and they're often eager to follow their noses. So, be sure to keep your Shiba on a leash unless there is a secure fence.","care-nutrition":"Some Shiba Inus are indiscriminate eaters. But others can be picky. It might take some experimentation to find a food your dog likes. Look for a high-quality diet that is appropriate for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). And consider a food formulated specifically for medium-sized dogs.\n\nIt's always wise to monitor how much your pup eats to keep their weight in a healthy range. Measuring out meals can help prevent accidental overfeeding. And don't forget to account for treats. As a general rule, they should make up no more than 10% of a dog's calories.","care-grooming":"Be prepared to deal with shedding. The Shiba Inu requires regular brushing to remove excess hair. Some owners even use a shop vacuum to remove all the loose hair that seems to fall out in clumps!\n\nProfessional grooming is not required (and trimming the coat is prohibited according to the breed standard). But it might be worthwhile to have a pro cut your dog's nails—a necessary task that the breed seems to hate. You should also prioritize regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care)—including at-home teeth brushing and professional cleanings.","care-exercise":"Shiba Inus love active games, adventures, and all forms of exercise. Regular walks, swimming, fetch, and hide-and-seek are fun options, as are dog sports—such as agility, flyball, tracking, rally, and competitive obedience.","care-training":"Consistent training and [early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) will help ensure your Shiba Inu responds to commands and behaves around strangers.

Guinea Singing Dog","plural-name":"New Guinea Singing Dogs","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"New Guinea Singing Dogs (NGSD) are native to the Highlands of Papua New Guinea. These wild, free-roaming dogs have evolved naturally on the island over thousands of years—largely unobserved. Scientists didn't even know about the breed until the 1950s.\n\nSir Edward Hallstrom brought the first two dogs from Papua New Guinea to the Taronga Zoo in Australia in 1956. The majority of NGSD in North America are descendants of that pair. Experts initially believed the dogs were a distinct species. But DNA studies conducted in 2016 and 2017 revealed that they are genetically dingoes. Today, the captive population of NGSD is small, a mere ~300 dogs worldwide.\n\nNGSD, or \"Singers,\" are best known for their multi-pitched howls. They howl alone or in groups, with each dog having their own unique song.","facts":"The primitive New Guinea Singing Dog has a lively, alert temperament and impressive vocal skills. But due to their wild roots, these pups may pose challenges for most families and do best with experienced pet parents familiar with the breed.","traits-appearance":"New Guinea Singing Dogs are small-to-medium-sized pups with a graceful appearance.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The NGSD's plush double coat consists of a soft undercoat and coarse outer coat. The breed comes in various colors—including shades of red ranging from fawn to deep rust, red sable with dark brown or black tipping on the guard hairs, black and tan, and white.","traits-physical":"NGSDs have wedge-shaped heads, small, triangular eyes, small, prick, wide-set ears, and thick, bushy tails.","temperament":"New Guinea Singing Dogs are active, intelligent, and independent. They bond with their humans and happily show affection. But they don't have the same eager-to-please attitude most dogs do. And they tend to be aloof with strangers.\n\nSingers are curious dogs that love to explore their surroundings. Combine that trait with their strong hunting instinct, and you have a dog that—when off-leash—is a significant flight risk. And once they escape or chase after something, getting them back might be a challenge.\n\nThe NGSD's prey drive also makes them a threat to small animals. And they tend to act reactively toward other dogs (especially of the same sex). For these reasons, they do best in homes without other pets.\n\nIn addition to their harmonious howls, Singers have other uncommon skills. They're adept at opening cabinet doors and can climb trees. So, tall fences without nearby trees and diligent dog-proofing are a must with this breed.","care-nutrition":"New Guinea Singing Dogs thrive on a high-quality diet formulated for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). To help them maintain a healthy weight, keep an eye on their food intake and measure their portions to avoid overfeeding. And remember, treats should make up no more than 10% of a dog's daily calories, as a guideline.","care-grooming":"Brush and bathe your Singer as needed to keep their coat free from dirt and loose fur. And don't forget to trim those nails. If they get too long, they may cause your pup pain or even lead to problems running or walking.\n\nSingers will often \"brush\" their teeth after a meal by scraping their nails against them. It's a cute and unique behavior. But it doesn't take the place of a proper dental care routine. Professional cleanings and regular at-home teeth brushing (by a human) are the best ways to [prevent dental disease](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care).","care-exercise":"NGSDs are active pups that need daily exercise to stay happy and healthy. Long walks and hikes are great options to keep them fit. Just be sure to keep them on a leash when in unenclosed areas to prevent them from taking off after other critters.","care-training":"Though intelligent, Singers are also very independent and not overly motivated to please their people. This can make training difficult. For the best chance of success, establish yourself as the pack leader and use firm, consistent training techniques.\n\nIn addition to basic obedience training, [socializing your pup](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) when they're young will help them develop into a predictable, well-mannered adult dog.","care-health":null,"references":"https://ngsdconservation.org","reviewed-by":"Jamie Freyer, DVM","date-reviewed":"2021-06-16T16:07:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":7.7,"weight-range-pet-max":13.6,"weight-range-show-min":7.7,"weight-range-show-max":13.6,"height-range-min":33.0,"height-range-max":45.7,"life-span-range-min":12.0,"life-span-range-max":18.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":null,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":null,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":null},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1f9d5c26-a358-5ecc-b117-582b76491559/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1f9d5c26-a358-5ecc-b117-582b76491559/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1f9d5c26-a358-5ecc-b117-582b76491559/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1f9d5c26-a358-5ecc-b117-582b76491559/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1f9d5c26-a358-5ecc-b117-582b76491559/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1f9d5c26-a358-5ecc-b117-582b76491559/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1f9d5c26-a358-5ecc-b117-582b76491559/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1f9d5c26-a358-5ecc-b117-582b76491559/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1f9d5c26-a358-5ecc-b117-582b76491559/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1f9d5c26-a358-5ecc-b117-582b76491559/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1f9d5c26-a358-5ecc-b117-582b76491559/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1f9d5c26-a358-5ecc-b117-582b76491559/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1f9d5c26-a358-5ecc-b117-582b76491559/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1f9d5c26-a358-5ecc-b117-582b76491559/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1f9d5c26-a358-5ecc-b117-582b76491559/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1f9d5c26-a358-5ecc-b117-582b76491559/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1f9d5c26-a358-5ecc-b117-582b76491559/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1f9d5c26-a358-5ecc-b117-582b76491559/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"1fbd7002-5451-5257-af44-dcf6dcfa2637","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/1fbd7002-5451-5257-af44-dcf6dcfa2637"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"cao-fila-de-sao-miguel","name":"Cão de Fila de São Miguel","plural-name":"Cães de Fila de São Miguel","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"Likely originating on the São Miguel island in the Azores region of Portugal, the Cão de Fila de São Miguel dates back to the early 19th century. Experts believe the breed descended from the now-extinct Terceira Dog.\n\nFilas are Molosser-type dogs that worked on farms guarding and herding cattle. The first official breed standard was developed in 1984, and the FCI recognized it internationally in 1995.\n\nThough these dogs live primarily in the Azores, some people import the rare breed to Europe, North America, and other locations.","facts":"The Cão de Fila de São Miguel is a determined, intelligent working breed. Highly protective of their herds, these pups also make loyal companions.","traits-appearance":"These dogs are large, robust, and hardy. They have broad heads, straight necks, deep chests, and muscular builds.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Filas have short, smooth, dense coats that are lightly fringed on the tail, anal region, and back of the thighs. The breed's brindle coat comes in shades of fawn, black, and gray. Some Filas have white markings on the forehead or feet or from the chin to the chest.","traits-physical":"Notable traits of the Cão de Fila de São Miguel include a square head, powerful jaw, medium-sized, triangular drop ears, and a high-set, thick tail.","temperament":"Filas are intelligent, hardworking dogs that excel at protecting both livestock and people. They're loyal to their humans and form tight bonds with their families—but they can be wary of strangers.\n\nThese driven, sometimes territorial pups are best suited for experienced pet parents.","care-nutrition":"Filas thrive on a high-quality diet formulated for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior).\n\nSince they're deep-chested, they may be at greater risk of bloat (also known as twisted stomach). To help prevent bloat, break your dog's food up into several meals a day, and use a food bowl designed to slow their eating. Also, avoid feeding immediately before or after any kind of vigorous activity. These are just a few ways you can help prevent this life-threatening condition. Consult your veterinarian about other options and recommendations.\n\nAll dogs are at risk for obesity if they overeat. To help your dog maintain a healthy weight, measure their portions and keep an eye on how many treats you're giving. As a guideline, they should make up no more than 10% of a dog's daily calories.","care-grooming":"Weekly brushing and the occasional bath will keep the Cão de Fila de São Miguel's short coat looking its best. To reduce your dog's chance of ear infections, check their ears regularly and clean them as needed to remove wax build-up and debris. Nail trims should also be part of every dog's grooming routine.\n\nLastly, good [dental hygiene](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) will support your dog's overall health. In addition to professional cleanings, establish an at-home dental care program that includes regular teeth brushing and veterinarian-recommended dental chews.","care-exercise":"A short walk around the block is not enough for the Fila. This active working breed requires a fair amount of daily exercise to stay happy and healthy. Long, brisk walks, hikes, and opportunities to run and chase are all good outlets for a Fila's energy.","care-training":"Known for their intelligence, Cão de Fila de São Miguels are eager to please their people and respond well to firm, consistent training sessions.\n\nFilas also require [socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) starting from puppyhood.

The breed became known as the Small Münsterlander in 1912.\n\nDespite the name, these dogs aren't just little versions of the [Large Münsterlander](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/munsterlander-large). In fact, experts think they were developed from different breeding stock entirely. The breed came to North America in 1971. And the AKC recognized it as a Foundation Stock Service breed since 2006.","facts":"The Small Münsterlander is an energetic, easily trained, and typically friendly dog. Versatile hunting companions and adaptable family members, Small Münsterlanders enjoy both working hard and curling up on the couch with their people.","traits-appearance":"The Small Münsterlander is a medium-size breed with a sturdy build and balanced proportions. A distinguished head and upright posture give the dog a look of quality and elegance.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Small Münsterlander's coat is medium-length, glossy, and straight or slightly wavy. It's also water-repellant and dense enough to protect the dog against weather and rough terrain.\n\nThis breed's coat typically comes in white and brown (chestnut), brown roan, or brown ticked. All color combinations may be with or without tan points or white spotting.","traits-physical":"The Small Münsterlander has a long, feathered tail that both looks beautiful and gives the breed its superb swimming abilities.","temperament":"Small Münsterlanders have a strong pack instinct that makes them well-suited for family life—they love to be involved in all outings and activities. And if offered a spot on the bed at night, most Small Münsterlanders happily accept.\n\nBred to perform many tasks in extreme weather conditions and on challenging terrain, Small Münsterlanders are versatile hunting dogs. However, the instincts that make them excellent hunters also compel them to chase small pets and bark.\n\nSome Small Münsterlanders may be full of nervous energy. Plenty of exercise and [early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) will help them grow into well-adjusted, well-mannered adult dogs.","care-nutrition":"Small Münsterlanders require a high-quality, age-appropriate dog food, whether commercially manufactured or homemade (with a veterinarian's supervision and approval).\n\nIt's important to monitor how much your Small Münsterlander eats. To prevent them from becoming overweight, reduce the portions as needed, and take treats into account when tracking their daily calorie intake. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of a dog's calories.","care-grooming":"Small Münsterlanders need only occasional brushing to keep their coats looking clean and healthy. However, when they shed their coats in the spring and fall, they require more frequent grooming.\n\nYour Small Münsterlander's nails will wear down some through daily activity. But you should still inspect them regularly for splits or cracks and trim as needed.\n\nIn addition to professional dental cleanings, Small Münsterlanders need a regular at-home dental care routine that includes teeth brushing and dental chews or treats. Maintaining good [dental hygiene](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) is essential for the overall long-term health of all breeds.","care-exercise":"Small Münsterlanders need lots of daily exercise and mental stimulation. Accomplish both with canine sports, such as field trials, tracking, agility, and obedience. Or take advantage of your dog's sporting breed background and throw tennis balls or frisbees for them to retrieve. Whatever you do, just be sure you give them plenty of room to run. Small Münsterlanders can sprint up to 25 mph!\n\nLong walks, hikes, and backyard play sessions are other great ways for your dog to release energy. But to truly make a Small Münsterlander happy, take them for a swim. These pups love splashing around—it's great exercise and lets them show off their impressive swimming abilities.","care-training":"Small Münsterlanders are intelligent and easily trained.

These dogs were specifically bred to be excellent babysitters, but they also worked as hunters and herders through the 1700s. Unfortunately, their population all but vanished after the arrival of Europeans in the early 1800s.\n\nLa Flamme traveled to Indian reservations from Canada to Mexico, searching for dogs that most closely approximated the old native dogs. Slowly but surely—and with the help and history of Tribal Elders—he found several dogs that served as the foundation stock for the American Indian Dog breeding program. Though these dogs look and behave just like the traditional native dogs of yore, La Flamme points out it's impossible to prove that they directly descend from pure Native American dogs.\n\nIn 2001, La Flamme authorized the formation of the International Indian Dog Owners and Breeders Association. This group of owners and breeders is dedicated to maintaining the breed's appearance, primitive instincts, and temperament.","facts":"The American Indian Dog is a rare breed that captures the versatility and spirit of early Native American and First Nations dogs. These pups excel at a variety of duties and activities—including search and rescue, service, livestock guarding, and herding. They also make nurturing and devoted family companions.","traits-appearance":"The American Indian Dog is medium-sized with a light build and dingo-like appearance.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The coat of the American Indian Dog consists of a short, thick undercoat and longer guard hairs that stand off from the body. The breed's hair is longest on the chest, ruff, shoulders, back of legs, and tail. These dogs come in various colors—including black, blue, white, gray, fawn, and silver. All coat colors have sable shading with darker tipped guard hairs.","traits-physical":"American Indian Dogs have wedge-shaped, moderately long muzzles, longish pricked ears, and almond-shaped eyes that come in pale yellow or pale blue. They also have long, bushy tails that they carry down with a slight curve.","temperament":"These intelligent working dogs and loyal companions have a strong pack instinct and bond closely with their people. That said, they tend to be reserved with strangers. Their alert personalities and nurturing instincts make them excellent family watch dogs.","care-nutrition":"American Indian Dogs thrive on a high-quality diet formulated for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). Staying at a healthy weight is important for their long-term health. To prevent obesity, carefully monitor your dog's food intake—including treats. As a guideline, they should make up no more than 10% of a pup's daily calories.","care-grooming":"This breed has relatively modest grooming needs. Weekly brushing and the occasional bath will keep your dog looking their best. Regular nail trims should also be part of their monthly routine, as nails that get too long can cause pain and potentially lead to problems running or walking.\n\nGood [dental hygiene](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) is essential to every dog's overall health. Dental disease is one of the most common conditions in adult dogs. Left untreated, it can contribute to other serious health issues.

At that time, hunting with scenthounds for deer, wolves, foxes, and \"bustards\" (large, crane-like Polish birds) was a popular sport. The Polish Greyhound's speed allowed them to keep up with men on horseback during the hunt. As a result, nobility highly favored the breed.\n\nBut under communist rule, these dogs nearly disappeared. Fortunately, some hunters secretly continued to use Polish Greyhounds to hunt game—helping these loyal dogs survive the Iron Curtain.\n\nThe United Kennel Club recognized the Polish Greyhound on January 1, 1996.","facts":"The Polish Greyhound is a brave, confident, and loyal breed. Like other sighthounds, these dogs are hardy, skilled hunters and make for quiet, well-mannered family pets.","traits-appearance":"The Polish Greyhound is a large, muscular (yet sleek) dog with a commanding appearance. The breed has powerful jaws and a strong frame. Such traits allowed these dogs to hunt successfully in Poland's severe conditions and climate.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Polish Greyhounds have relatively harsh coats that are springy to the touch. Hair length varies over all the body—though it's shortest on the chest and legs and longest on the buttocks and tail. The coat comes in all colors.","traits-physical":"Polish Greyhounds have long, lean heads and almond-shaped eyes that cast a lively, penetrating gaze. Their feathered tails are long and curve at the tip—forming a sickle shape or complete circle.","temperament":"The Polish Greyhound is a good-tempered, loyal breed. These brave pups make excellent guardians and form strong bonds with their people. Despite their large size, they're typically careful around kids of all ages.\n\nPolish Greyhounds are speedy dogs that love to sprint and chase things—including cats, small pets, or wildlife. When they catch something, their instincts tend to take over (which usually isn't good for the little critter). For this reason, it's wise to have a securely fenced yard and warn neighbors not to let their small pets come over for a surprise visit.","care-nutrition":"Polish Greyhounds need high-quality food appropriate for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). They also benefit from diets formulated for large-breed dogs—particularly when they are puppies. This helps prevent them from growing too fast and developing skeletal problems down the road.\n\nThese dogs are at a greater risk than most breeds for bloat (also known as twisted stomach). To help prevent bloat, break your dog's food up into several meals a day, and use a food bowl specially designed to slow their eating. When timing meals, avoid feeding your pup immediately before or after any vigorous activity.\n\nThese are just a few ways you can help prevent this life-threatening condition. Consult your veterinarian about other ways—including surgical options—to prevent bloat.","care-grooming":"Polish Greyhounds have relatively low-maintenance coats. Weekly brushing is all that's needed to keep them looking their best. Nail trims, ear cleanings, and regular dental care—including at-home teeth brushing and professional cleanings—should also be part of their grooming routines.","care-exercise":"This active breed needs plenty of daily exercise and mental stimulation. Large, enclosed areas allow Polish Greyhounds to show off their speed and burn off energy. They also seem to enjoy dog sports, such as lure coursing, racing, agility, and competitive obedience. And, if you can keep up with them, they make good jogging buddies.","care-training":"All sighthounds respond best to positive and reward-based training. Polish Greyhounds may also require careful socialization to prevent or reduce fear-based defensive behaviors. Start this socialization at an early age to help your pup grow into a well-adjusted adult

Terrier","plural-name":"Tenterfield Terriers","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"Tenterfield Terriers descended from miniature Fox Terriers that accompanied English settlers to Australia in the 1800s. Their small size and exceptional vermin-hunting abilities made them indispensable shipmates on the grueling months-long voyage.\n\nThese hardworking dogs established themselves in Australia not only as tenacious ratters but also as cherished family pets. They became fixtures in homes throughout New South Wales—and in the Tenterfield district, in particular.\n\nIn the early 1990s, a group of owners came together to establish a breed registry. Initially, they referred to the dogs as \"Mini Foxies.\" However, wanting to avoid confusion between their dogs and the [Smooth Fox Terrier](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/fox-terrier-smooth), they ultimately settled on Tenterfield Terrier for the breed name.\n\nThe Tenterfield Terrier Club of Australia was formed in 1993. Nine years later, the Australian National Kennel Council recognized the breed.","facts":"The Tenterfield Terrier is an adaptable, outgoing, lively breed. With their friendly personality and loyal nature, these pups make excellent companions for children, seniors, and everyone in between.","traits-appearance":"The Tenterfield Terrier is a strong, agile working dog with an intelligent, alert expression.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Tenterfields have short, smooth coats with no undercoat. They're predominantly white with black, liver, blue, or tan markings. Tri-color coats are common, and brindle markings are acceptable in the breed standard (but not preferred).","traits-physical":"The Tenterfield has a medium-sized head and a strong muzzle. The breed's V-shaped ears are slightly rounded at the tip and stand erect or semi-erect. These dogs also have short, compact bodies and strong legs. And naturally bobbed tails are a common breed trait.","temperament":"Clever, loyal, confident dogs, Tenterfields are fearless and focused when working. But they make friendly, outgoing family pets and love attention from their people.\n\nAs playful pups, they also get along with other dogs and kids. But like most terriers, they have a strong prey drive and tend to give chase. So, they may not be the best choice for homes with cats or other small pets.\n\nFinally, because this breed can sometimes get destructive when bored, be sure to keep your Tenterfield entertained with puzzle and chew toys whenever you have to leave them at home alone.","care-nutrition":"Tenterfield Terriers thrive on high-quality dog food formulated for their life stage. To help your dog maintain a healthy weight, measure their portions to avoid overfeeding and keep an eye on how many treats you're giving them. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of a dog's daily calories.","care-grooming":"The Tenterfield's short coat is easy to maintain. Brushing every couple of weeks to remove loose fur and the occasional bath will keep their coats clean and healthy.\n\nTo reduce your pup's chance of ear infections, check their ears regularly and clean them as needed to remove wax build-up and debris. Nail trims should also be part of every dog's grooming routine. If nails grow too long, they can cause pain and potentially lead to problems running or walking.\n\nLastly, good [dental hygiene](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) is vital for your pup's overall health. Dental disease is one of the most common health conditions in adult dogs—especially for small breeds like the Tenterfield. Left untreated, it can contribute to other serious issues. So, in addition to professional cleanings, establish an at-home dental care program that includes regular teeth brushing and veterinarian-recommended dental chews.","care-exercise":"This active, hardy breed needs regular exercise to stay happy and healthy. Consider making habits of activities such as daily walks, backyard play sessions, and games of fetch.","care-training":"Early, consistent obedience training using a positive, reward-based approach works well for this breed.\n\nAdditionally, all dogs benefit from [socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization). Getting your pup comfortable with different people and environments when they're young will help them develop into a confident, well-mannered adult dog.","care-health":null,"references":"http://ankc.org.au/Breed/Detail/103\n\nhttps://www.tenterfieldterriers.org/history\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenterfield_Terrier\n\nhttps://www.vetwest.com.au/pet-library/tenterfield-terrier","reviewed-by":"Annette Louviere, DVM","date-reviewed":"2021-07-09T19:21:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":3.5,"weight-range-pet-max":5.5,"weight-range-show-min":3.5,"weight-range-show-max":5.5,"height-range-min":25.5,"height-range-max":30.5,"life-span-range-min":12.0,"life-span-range-max":16.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":null,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":null,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":null},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/207e8dab-00e4-5d78-864b-46a2ce80565a/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/207e8dab-00e4-5d78-864b-46a2ce80565a/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/207e8dab-00e4-5d78-864b-46a2ce80565a/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/207e8dab-00e4-5d78-864b-46a2ce80565a/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/207e8dab-00e4-5d78-864b-46a2ce80565a/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/207e8dab-00e4-5d78-864b-46a2ce80565a/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/207e8dab-00e4-5d78-864b-46a2ce80565a/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/207e8dab-00e4-5d78-864b-46a2ce80565a/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/207e8dab-00e4-5d78-864b-46a2ce80565a/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/207e8dab-00e4-5d78-864b-46a2ce80565a/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/207e8dab-00e4-5d78-864b-46a2ce80565a/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/207e8dab-00e4-5d78-864b-46a2ce80565a/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/207e8dab-00e4-5d78-864b-46a2ce80565a/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/207e8dab-00e4-5d78-864b-46a2ce80565a/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/207e8dab-00e4-5d78-864b-46a2ce80565a/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/207e8dab-00e4-5d78-864b-46a2ce80565a/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/207e8dab-00e4-5d78-864b-46a2ce80565a/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/207e8dab-00e4-5d78-864b-46a2ce80565a/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"20809958-2ba3-5553-8f93-6562b1ad91c8","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/20809958-2ba3-5553-8f93-6562b1ad91c8"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"estonian-hound","name":"Estonian Hound","plural-name":"Estonian Hounds","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The Estonian Hound is a newer breed and the only one developed in Estonia.\n\nIn 1947, the Soviet Union's Ministry of Agriculture and Economy declared that every country in the union must have its own dog breed. But not just any dog breed would do. They wanted to replace the large hunting dogs of the day with smaller, more agile ones less likely to endanger Estonia's shrinking wildlife population. So, people crossed local hunting dogs with [Beagles](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/beagle) and various hounds.\n\nIn 1954, the Ministry approved the breed standard for the Estonian Hound. After Estonia regained its independence, it declared the breed its national dog. And it remains extremely popular among both hunters and families there today.","facts":"Estonian Hounds are happy, friendly dogs and energetic hunting companions. They love attention and form tight bonds with their humans—making them a devoted and affectionate addition to most families.","traits-appearance":"The Estonian Hound is a medium-sized dog with a strong, muscular build.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The breed has a short, harsh, glossy coat and moderate undercoat. These dogs typically come in a tricolor pattern consisting of black patches with tan and vivid white markings.","traits-physical":"Estonian Hounds have a moderately wide and slightly curved skull, long and straight muzzle, dark brown eyes, and thin drop ears that reach half the length of the muzzle when pulled. Their tails form a saber and are thick at the base and covered in dense hair.","temperament":"Calm, friendly dogs, Estonian Hounds make excellent family pets. They're gentle and playful with kids and get along well with other dogs. (Cats, on the other hand, take a little getting used to.)\n\nThough they are energetic hunting partners, Estonian Hounds also have a laid-back side. Cuddle sessions on the couch? Sign them up. As long as they get to spend time with their humans, they're happy.\n\nThese pups love to follow a scent trail—which is great for hunting but not so great for outings with the family. It's best to keep your dog on a leash when outdoors to prevent them from wandering off.","care-nutrition":"Estonian Hounds thrive on a high-quality diet formulated for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). Foods created specifically for medium-breed dogs are also a great option to consider.\n\nTo help your dog maintain a healthy weight, measure their portions to avoid overfeeding, and keep an eye on how many treats you're giving them. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of a dog's daily calories.","care-grooming":"Estonian Hounds are moderate shedders and require weekly brushing to remove loose fur—as well as an occasional bath to keep them clean and tidy. To reduce the chance of infections, check your pup's ears regularly and clean them as needed to remove wax build-up and debris.\n\nNail trims should also be part of every dog's grooming routine. If your Estonian Hound's nails grow too long, they can cause pain and potentially lead to problems running or walking.\n\nLastly, good [dental hygiene](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) will support your dog's overall health.

They enjoy long walks and hikes and love the chance to run around in large, fenced areas.

They are also known as Karakachan, after the Balkan Greek nomadic shepherds who used the breed as border dogs and livestock or property guard dogs.\n\nAfter World War II, wolves were close to extinction and were no longer threatening livestock. Because of this, the need for livestock guards dwindled. The Communist government had a large number of sheepdogs—including the Bulgarian Shepherd—put down, leaving only shepherd dogs on government-owned farms and in hidden, remote areas.\n\nLuckily, the Bulgarian Shepherd survived, and today, Bulgarians celebrate the dog. In 2005, the country declared the Bulgarian Shepherd as an old native breed.","facts":"The Bulgarian Shepherd—also referred to as Karakachan—originated in Bulgaria as guardians for mountain livestock. Although they can be reserved with strangers, they are devoted and loyal to their families.","traits-appearance":"This strong and sturdy breed is a large dog with a thick, short coat or a long coat and V-shaped, folded ears.

They have broad, deep chests, massive heads, and low-set tails. Their eyes are small and brown, and their V-shaped ears lay flat against their head.","temperament":"Though the Bulgarian Shepherd is loyal and loving to their family, they came about as watchdogs who kept an eye over their land and flock.

Although they can be loving with children when they are properly socialized, make sure to always keep a watchful eye around small children, in particular, because of their imposing size.","care-nutrition":"As with most active breeds, the Bulgarian Shepherd does best with high-quality dog food that’s suited to their particular age and any additional health concerns.\n\nIt’s important to monitor the amount of food and treats that you give your Bulgarian Shepherd, especially since some dogs may be prone to gaining weight as they age. Your veterinarian is always a good source to help provide you with appropriate nutrition and feeding guidelines.","care-grooming":"Although the Bulgarian Shepherd’s coat is weatherproof, they usually need to be brushed several times a week to prevent mats and to remove loose fur any dirt.

These ancestral dogs were mainly brought to Poland from France and Italy, and written accounts of the Polish using them for hunting date back to the 13th century. \n\nTwo types of Polish hounds were documented to exist by at least the 17th century, a heavier “brach” and a lighter scent hound. During World War II, both types almost went extinct, but were rescued by breeding efforts in the 1950’s. Initially the larger Kartawik variety and the smaller Pawłusiewicz variety (both named after their respective breeders) were recognized by the FCI as a single breed: the Polish Hound or Ogar Polski. However, hunters continued to breed and preserve the smaller Polish Hunting Dog type as a working dog, and it was recognized as a separate breed 20 years later as the Gończy Polski.\n\nThe breed standard for today's Polish Hunting Dog is based on Pawłusiewicz's dogs, and is still favored by hunters for mountainous and challenging terrain.","facts":"The Polish Hunting Dog is an intelligent, alert scent hound. These energetic dogs have strong hunting instincts and are always game for outdoor adventures.","traits-appearance":"The Polish Hunting Dog is a medium-sized breed with a compact body and strong but not heavy bone structure.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Polish Hunting Dogs have a short, shiny outer coat and abundant undercoat. The hair on their head and ears is soft, while their body hair is harsh to the touch. Their coat is black, chocolate tan-pointed, or rarely, red.","traits-physical":"This breed has a noble head, oblique eyes that bear a kind expression, hanging triangular ears, a deep chest, and a slightly brushy tail that reaches the hock joint. ","temperament":"Polish Hunting dogs are courageous hunters and gentle companions bred for working. They make devoted family pets but may be wary of strangers (a characteristic that makes them good watchdogs).\n\nThese energetic pups love spending time outdoors, where they get to use their keen sense of smell. However, because they are prone to following a scent, it's best to keep them on a leash or in an enclosed area. ","care-nutrition":"This breed thrives on high-quality dog food appropriate for their age, size, and activity level. To help them maintain a healthy weight, measure their meals to avoid overfeeding and keep treats to 10% or less of their daily calories.","care-grooming":"The Polish Hunting Dog's short coat requires only weekly brushing to keep it looking its best. Their hanging ears may make it harder to spot ear infections, so check their ears regularly and clean them if you see any wax build-up or debris. Additionally, nail trims and [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) should be part of their grooming routine.","care-exercise":"Polish Hunting Dogs need plenty of daily exercise to stay mentally and physically fit. They are working dogs that are not suitable for apartment living or the couch potato lifestyle. They love brisk walks, running, hiking, and swimming. They also enjoy games that allow them to show off their retrieving skills.","care-training":"This intelligent breed has a stubborn streak and can be challenging for inexperienced pet parents to train. For best results, establish yourself as the pack leader and use a consistent, firm training approach. \n\nAdditionally, all dogs benefit from [early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization). Helping them feel comfortable with different people and environments when they're young will help them grow into well-adjusted adult

Fall hunting season.\n\nEventually, the Otterhound packs sent in to capture the Otter became so good at their job (probably thanks in no small part to their webbed feet), river otters nearly became extinct, and it became illegal to hunt them.","facts":"Given their shaggy appearance and friendly, comical personality, Otterhounds make adorable and fun family companions. Their unique characteristics—like webbed feet and a rough double coat that’s water repellent—make them excellent hunters on both land and water. A versatile and adaptable breed, there’s a lot to love about the Otterhound.","traits-appearance":"Although the Otterhound is typically considered a large breed, there is a considerable size range between the different sexes. Males, for example, can weigh up to 115 pounds, while females tend to weigh in around 80 pounds.\n\nA dense outer coat and a wooly, water repellent undercoat cover the Otterhound’s rectangular body. They have a large head and low-set, folded ears.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Otterhound has a dense, coarse outer coat and a wooly, water repellent undercoat. They can come many different color combinations, although they commonly have coats with variations on black and tan with grizzle markings.","traits-physical":"While their shaggy, water repellent coat, and large stature may be the first thing you notice about an Otterhound, their most exciting feature is their webbed feet.","temperament":"If you’d like a dog that’s friendly and boisterous, the Otterhound is your dog. These gentle giants are warm and affectionate, but they have an independent streak which means they aren’t constantly underfoot.\n\nAlthough they don’t mind finding ways to stay entertained on their own, without the proper training, those methods might include things like excessive digging or baying.\n\nProperly trained and [socialized](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) Otterhounds get along well with other dogs and animals, and they can be good with children as well, although their formidable size is something to keep in mind.","care-nutrition":"Feed your Otterhound a high-quality dog food that’s suited to their particular age, activity level, and size, as well as any additional health concerns. Keep in mind that some members of the breed are prone to bloating, in which case it’s a good idea to feed several smaller meals throughout the day rather than a few larger ones.\n\nAs with any dog, it’s important to monitor the amount of food and treats that you give your Otterhound to avoid having them gain weight, especially as they age. Your veterinarian is always a good source to help provide you with appropriate nutrition and feeding guidelines.","care-grooming":"Despite their shaggy appearance, the Otterhound doesn’t traditionally shed a lot, and weekly brushings with a grooming mitt or comb should help ward off any mats.\n\nAll dogs require regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care), including at-home teeth brushing and professional dental cleanings, and the Otterhound is no exception. Maintaining good dental hygiene is important for their overall long-term health.","care-exercise":"This active hunting breed requires a good amount of exercise to keep them healthy and to stop them from entertaining themselves with less-than-desirable hobbies, like digging. Long walks work well, as long as you keep them on a leash, while obedience classes, tracking, and agility also provide mental stimulation.","care-training":"Because of their size and strength, independence, and, sometimes, stubbornness, it may take a little extra patience to train an Otterhound, but it will be worth the effort. Keep in mind that most Otterhounds are pretty sensitive—despite their large size—so they react best to a calm and gentle leader.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.otterhound.org/\n\nhttps://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/otterhound/","reviewed-by":"Laura Inman,

being one of the most well-known dog breeds today, the origins of the Chihuahua are a bit of a mystery. Some experts believe they once belonged to the ancient Mayans. The breed may have been the result of crossing the Techichi—a dog that played an important role in both the Toltec and Aztec cultures—and the [Chinese Crested dog](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/chinese-crested).\n\nThough the ancient civilizations were eventually destroyed, the resilient breed survived in Chihuahua, Mexico. It came to the United States in the late 1800s when Americans visiting Mexico took an interest in the dogs and brought them back home as souvenirs from their trips.\n\nAs more of these dogs made their way to the U.S., they were called many names—including Arizona Dogs, Texas Dogs, and Mexican Dogs. However, the name \"Chihuahua\" is what eventually stuck.\n\nThe Chihuahua became an AKC-recognized breed in 1904. It now consistently enjoys a spot on the list of most popular dog breeds in the U.S.","facts":"Chihuahuas are the smallest dog breed in the world, but these tiny pups have big personalities and even bigger hearts. When properly socialized, Chihuahuas make for quirky, alert companions that are well-suited for living in apartments and small homes.","traits-appearance":"In addition to their small size, Chihuahuas have tall, upright ears and large, rounded eyes, compact bodies, short muzzles, and moderately long tails. Despite their tiny stature, they have muscular bodies.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Chihuahua's coat comes in two varieties: smooth-haired and long-haired. The smooth-haired Chihuahua's coat is short, smooth, and glossy. Some have undercoats made up of hair that is slightly longer. Smooth-haired Chihuahuas inherit their coats by carrying one or two copies of the dominant gene for short hair.\n\nLong-haired Chihuahuas have longer coats that are silky and either smooth or slightly wavy. Often they have fringe around the ears and tail. Long-haired Chihuahuas inherit their coats by carrying two copies of the recessive gene for long hair. A Chihuahua's coat can come in almost all possible colors and patterns and may include dark masks, merle, and white markings.","traits-physical":"There are two main types of Chihuahuas—apple head and deer head—though only the apple head adheres to AKC standards.\n\nAs the name suggests, apple head Chihuahuas have well-rounded, apple-shaped skulls. Deer head Chihuahuas have a longer, deer-like head with a more gradual slope where the muzzle joins the forehead. Deer heads typically have longer legs, larger ears, and tend to be larger in size.\n\nThe tail of the Chihuahua is set high and tapers as it reaches the tip. The carriage of the tail is an important trait—it's generally carried high and in a curved or semi-circular shape.","temperament":"The Chihuahua is an active, often playful dog with a big personality. They tend to bond closely with one or two people and will show those people great affection. Chihuahuas don't typically enjoy being left alone for long periods. Luckily, their small size makes them an easy breed to take on frequent outings.\n\nIf not [properly socialized](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization), Chihuahuas can be apprehensive and nervous around strangers or other dogs and pets. This may result in barking or even snapping when the dog feels anxious or threatened.\n\nChihuahuas can do well around children as long as kids aren't too rambunctious and are mindful not to scare these little pups. Very young children may struggle to keep their energy levels and movements subdued enough to make a Chihuahua feel safe.\n\n[House-breaking](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/potty-train-a-puppy) Chihuahuas can sometimes be challenging, requiring patience and more frequent potty breaks. Some Chihuahuas can be trained to use indoor potty areas.","care-nutrition":"Chihuahuas require more calories per pound of bodyweight than larger dogs. Because their small stomachs don't allow them to eat large meals, it's best to feed them several small meals throughout the day to fulfill their caloric requirements. However, take care not to overfeed Chihuahuas. For such a small dog, even a couple extra treats can add up and lead to weight gain.\n\nChihuahuas should eat a diet created for small breed dogs (as well as their specific life stage). These diets will have the appropriate blend of nutrients and a smaller kibble size, allowing the tiny pups to properly chew and digest their food.","care-grooming":"Smooth-haired Chihuahuas need only occasional brushing due to their short, tidy coats. Long-haired Chihuahuas should be brushed at least weekly to prevent their coats from becoming tangled or matted.\n\nAll dogs require regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care), including at-home teeth brushing and professional dental cleanings. Chihuahuas are particularly susceptible to dental issues due to their small mouths and crowded teeth. So, they may require more frequent cleanings beginning at an early age.","care-exercise":"Though Chihuahuas are perfectly happy to curl up in their favorite person's lap, they do need daily exercise. However, they don't require long walks or rigorous physical activity.\n\nShort, indoor play sessions are often enough to meet their exercise requirements. Still, for mental stimulation, Chihuahuas should be able to go outside, sniff, and explore. But keep in mind—unless they are confined to an area with other small dogs—Chihuahuas will likely be outmatched in size at dog parks.","care-training":"Chihuahuas have high intelligence and like to please their owners, making them a very trainable breed (and one that seems to enjoy performing entertaining tricks). However, they can be a bit stubborn and like to get their way. So, be prepared to remain firm and consistent during training sessions.\n\nChihuahuas respond well to [reward-based training](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-obedience-training) using treats or favorite toys.","care-health":null,"references":"https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/dog-breeds/chihuahua-smooth-coat\n\nhttp://www.fci.be/Nomenclature/Standards/218g09-en.pdf\n\nhttps://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/dog-breeds/chihuahua-long\n\nhttps://www.royalcanin.com/us/dogs/products/retail-products/small-adult-dry-dog-food\n\nhttps://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/chihuahua/\n\nhttps://www.chihuahuawardrobe.com/deer-head-vs-apple-head-chihuahua-whats-the-difference/","reviewed-by":"Cindy Elston, DVM, MPH","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":0.9,"weight-range-pet-max":4.1,"weight-range-show-min":0.9,"weight-range-show-max":3.4,"height-range-min":15.0,"height-range-max":23.0,"life-span-range-min":14.0,"life-span-range-max":20.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":71,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":46,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":34},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/21dfc143-9420-5e0f-84b9-1e7240fe88ed/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/21dfc143-9420-5e0f-84b9-1e7240fe88ed/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/21dfc143-9420-5e0f-84b9-1e7240fe88ed/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/21dfc143-9420-5e0f-84b9-1e7240fe88ed/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/21dfc143-9420-5e0f-84b9-1e7240fe88ed/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/21dfc143-9420-5e0f-84b9-1e7240fe88ed/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/21dfc143-9420-5e0f-84b9-1e7240fe88ed/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/21dfc143-9420-5e0f-84b9-1e7240fe88ed/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/21dfc143-9420-5e0f-84b9-1e7240fe88ed/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/21dfc143-9420-5e0f-84b9-1e7240fe88ed/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/21dfc143-9420-5e0f-84b9-1e7240fe88ed/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/21dfc143-9420-5e0f-84b9-1e7240fe88ed/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/21dfc143-9420-5e0f-84b9-1e7240fe88ed/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/21dfc143-9420-5e0f-84b9-1e7240fe88ed/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/21dfc143-9420-5e0f-84b9-1e7240fe88ed/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/21dfc143-9420-5e0f-84b9-1e7240fe88ed/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/21dfc143-9420-5e0f-84b9-1e7240fe88ed/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/21dfc143-9420-5e0f-84b9-1e7240fe88ed/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"21f633a5-25ee-5c99-9159-64166ed0ec9a","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/21f633a5-25ee-5c99-9159-64166ed0ec9a"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"bloodhound","name":"Bloodhound","plural-name":"Bloodhounds","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The father of all scent hounds, the Bloodhound originated in Belgium in 700 A.D., where they were bred to track game for hunting. They were a large part of the St. Hubert monastery, kept by everyone from monks to bishops to assist in tracking wolves, big cats, and deer. Following the Norman invasion in 1066, Bloodhounds made their way to England, where the black-and-tan variety became known as the Bloodhound as we see them today. The white variety—which became known as the Talbot Hound—is now extinct.\n\nThroughout history, the Bloodhound has been used for everything from tracking and hunting animals to tracking missing people and criminals and assisting with drug searches. It’s estimated that a Bloodhound’s sense of smell is three million times better than that of human beings. Their tracking abilities have saved lives, and are so accurate that use of a Bloodhound’s nose will hold up in a court of law. The breed was introduced in the United States more than a century ago, where their love of tracking and performance has gained them a reputation as an excellent police dog.","facts":"Although Bloodhounds earn their reputation as amazing scent trackers, their gentle companionship makes them also an amazing family pet. They tend to be less energetic than other hounds, but they love being with their people and can also be great with kids.","traits-appearance":"These large dogs are known for their wrinkled faces and loose skin, with ears that droop and a set of warm, earnest eyes.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Bloodhound coat can vary in color between black and tan, liver and tan or red.","traits-physical":"Bloodhounds are hard to miss, not only because of their foreboding size, but also their quintessential soulful eyes, thin skin that sags (particularly around the head and neck), droopy ears, and wrinkled face.","temperament":"The Bloodhound is known as an intelligent and affectionate breed. They make great companions for adults and kids alike, since they tend to be very gentle, patient, and good-natured. They can have a stubborn or independent streak, though.\n\nFor a hunting dog with a particular talent for scent trailing, the Bloodhound’s affectionate and gentle nature may surprise some. This breed gets along well with people and other dogs and can be shy and sensitive at times.\n\nBloodhounds do require daily activity, and it’s important to always keep them on a leash when in an unfamiliar or uncontained area, as their stubbornness and predilection to hunt can get the best of them. They’re also known to be very good diggers, easily escaping from areas that aren’t properly and securely fenced.","care-nutrition":"Bloodhounds require a high-quality dog food that is age-appropriate—whether it’s commercially manufactured or homemade (with a veterinarian’s supervision and approval). It’s important to monitor the amount of food you give your Bloodhound. Reduce the portions or restrict calories if your pup gains weight.\n\nYour veterinarian is always a good source to help provide you with appropriate nutrition and feeding guidelines.","care-grooming":"Bloodhounds’ short, dense coats need to be brushed weekly to maintain overall health and remove loose hair, and they should be bathed regularly as well—paying particular attention to their folds—to avoid having dirt and debris build up.\n\nAll dogs require regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care), including at-home teeth brushing and professional dental cleanings, and the Bloodhound is no exception. Maintaining good dental hygiene is important for their overall long-term health.","care-exercise":"Though they may seem to operate in power-saver mode, this scent tracker is an active breed that requires plenty of daily exercise to stay happy and healthy. As a hound, any activity that involves hunting or chasing will be a favorite, but in the absence of that, even a nice long walk will suffice. Just remember to always keep Bloodhounds leashed when out and in unsecured areas, as their independent streak and love of tracking can get the best of them.","care-training":"Early and proper training is important for a Bloodhound, since this breed tends to have an independent and stubborn streak. These pups can also be sensitive at times, so they react well to positive rewards and praise. With a little patience and determination, training can be quite effective when handled properly.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/bloodhound/\n\nhttp://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/Bloodhound.pdf","reviewed-by":"Laura Inman,

Street Dog","plural-name":"Indian Street Dogs","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"Like all dogs, the Indian street dog is a descendant of the gray wolf. At some point, a number of wolves became domesticated (but experts disagree on exactly when and how).\n\nBy the 19th century, people began recording their efforts to selectively breed dogs for certain traits—a practice that led to the hundreds of purebred dogs we know and love today.  But the majority of dogs around the world do not belong to a particular breed. This includes Indian street dogs.\n\nThese landrace dogs have existed in India and Bangladesh for thousands of years. Also known as INDogs (short for Indian Native Dog), they served as hunting partners and companions to aboriginal people dating as far back as the Late Stone Age. Physically, they resemble some of the oldest fossils of domesticated dogs found in Israel and China.\n\nNowadays, most of these dogs roam the streets (though some do live as pets). They form communities within the neighborhoods they frequent and are often friendly and loving toward people who show them affection.","facts":"Indian street dogs are friendly, alert pups that typically congregate in cities or large towns where resources are plentiful. Though they're domesticated and share many basic traits with pet dogs, they lead primarily independent lives outdoors.","traits-appearance":"Indian street dogs are medium-sized with a square-to-slightly-rectangular build.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Indian street dog's short double coat consists of a coarse upper coat and soft undercoat. These pups primarily come in shades of fawn or pied (fawn with black and white). White markings on the limbs and tail tip are common. Pied dogs typically have spots on their undercoats.","traits-physical":"Indian street dogs have medium-sized, wedge-shaped heads, pointed muzzles, dark brown, almond-shaped eyes, and erect, pointed ears. They carry their curled tails high when they're excited.","temperament":"Naturally intelligent, Indian street dogs are capable of surviving on their own. They can be escape artists and are capable of climbing to high places. So, tall fences and close supervision are necessary to contain these wily pups.\n\nIndian street dogs are alert and social, but they may be uncomfortable around strangers. They're typically territorial and quick to bark if something catches their attention—making them excellent guard dogs.","care-nutrition":"Free-roaming Indian street dogs' diets typically consist of whatever they can kill or find—small farm animals, scraps from trash cans, handouts from kind strangers, and so on. If you're leaving food out for a street dog, they'll benefit from commercial diets formulated for pet dogs.\n\nBecause they fend for themselves, street dogs aren't usually at risk of becoming overweight. However, if you take a street dog under your roof, keep an eye on their food intake to avoid overfeeding. Guidelines on dog food packages are a good starting point when determining daily portions.","care-grooming":"If you've adopted a street dog that's comfortable being handled, regular brushing and nail trims will help them look their best. Good [dental hygiene](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) is also important for any dog. Professional cleanings and at-home dental care will keep their mouths healthy and reduce the risk of related health issues.","care-exercise":"Indian street dogs are active pups that need daily exercise. Long walks on a leash and play sessions inside a fenced yard will help them stay physically and mentally fit.","care-training":"These smart dogs have an independent nature. They're typically easy to train, but they get bored quickly.

Bay Retriever","plural-name":"Chesapeake Bay Retrievers","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The Chesapeake Bay Retriever is among the few breeds that originated in the United States. Their unique story began when two Newfoundland dogs from England survived a shipwreck off the shore of Maryland.\n\nOver time, these two dogs began to breed with the local retrieving and hunting dogs, including the Irish Water Spaniel, the Coonhound, the Flat-Coated Retriever, and the Curly-Coated Retriever. The resulting breed—with its wooly, waterproof coat—was well-suited for hunting in the Chesapeake Bay's near-freezing waters.\n\nTireless workers, dogs of this breed have retrieved up to 300 ducks from the bay in a single day. Given such impressive skill, the breed was eventually named the \"Chesapeake Bay Retriever.\"\n\nKnown by fans simply as a \"Chessie,\" it was one of the first nine breeds registered in America in 1878. And the AKC recognized the breed upon its founding in 1884.\n\nToday, in addition to being skilled hunting and retrieving dogs, Chessies make fantastic family pets. Who would have thought one shipwreck could bring such great treasure?","facts":"The Chesapeake Bay Retriever is an intelligent, cheerful breed. They are alert, energetic, and loyal—though they may be more independent-minded and aloof than other retrievers.","traits-appearance":"Built to hunt in the harsh, cold weather and water of the Mid-Atlantic, Chesapeake Bay Retrievers have powerful bodies, thick double coats, and strong jaws capable of gently carrying ducks and other large game birds.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Chesapeake Bay Retrievers have short, thick coats with dense, wooly undercoats. Their coats contain natural oils that prevent water from reaching their skin and enable quick drying. In fact, their coats resist water just like the feathers of the ducks they retrieve do.\n\nChessies' coats come in a variety of brown, sedge, or deadgrass colors; this helps them blend into their surroundings. Tan is also possible. This breed sometimes has a small white blaze of color on the chest.","traits-physical":"Chesapeake Bay Retrievers have broad, round skulls. Their distinctive eyes are medium-large, set wide apart, and very clear, with a yellowish or amber color.\n\nChessies have small ears that are set high on their heads and hang loosely. The tail of the Chesapeake Bay Retriever is medium length and medium-heavy at the base. It's straight or slightly curved.","temperament":"Chesapeake Bay Retrievers have a calm nature that makes them a great family dog. However, they mature relatively late, at the age of three years. In their adolescence, they can have a stubborn character that eventually gives way to the more relaxed temperament for which they're known. Therefore, a confident owner would be best-suited to this spirited breed.\n\nChessies enjoys the attention of people and the company of other dogs, but they may chase other pets. They particularly love swimming and retrieving, and do well with active families that take them on outdoor adventures.\n\nA calm nature coupled with athletic abilities and stamina not only make Chessies excellent hunting dogs but also allow them to excel in other jobs. They work as service dogs in law enforcement, performing bomb and drug detection, search and rescue, and disability assistance.\n\nChessies may be aloof or reserved with strangers. [Careful socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) can help prevent or reduce fear-based defensive aggression.","care-nutrition":"Chesapeake Bay Retrievers are prone to being overweight. To keep their weight in a healthy range, their food intake—including treats— should be closely monitored. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of their calories each day.\n\nTo meet their nutritional needs, feed Chessies a high-quality food that's appropriate for their current life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). Experts recommend a diet specially formulated for large-breed dogs. In particular, large-breed puppy diets keep Chessies from growing too fast and may decrease the incidence or severity of hip dysplasia as they age.","care-grooming":"To keep their coats healthy and free of loose or dead hair, brush your Chesapeake Bay Retriever once a week, or more frequently during periods of heavy shedding. Because the natural oils in their coats provide needed protection from icy water, avoid bathing before cold-weather hunting trips.\n\nA Chesapeake Bay Retriever's nails should get trimmed frequently; overly long nails can cause pain or discomfort.\n\nRegular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) is essential for their overall long-term health. In addition to professional dental cleanings, you should establish an at-home dental care routine. This may include regular teeth-brushing and dental treats or toys.","care-exercise":"Chesapeake Bay Retrievers have tons of energy and stamina, so they need plenty of daily exercise to keep them happy and calm. Long walks and hikes are great ways for them to burn off energy. They also enjoy dog sports such as tracking, hunting, field trials, agility, pulling sleds or carts, and obedience.\n\nBut most of all, they love retrieving and swimming. Retrieving items such as tennis balls and floating toys provides great exercise and takes advantage of their natural swimming ability.","care-training":"Chessies respond well to reward-based training. This can be helpful when redirecting their natural tendency to retrieve from inappropriate items (e.g., shoes or a child's favorite stuffed animal) to preferred items (e.g., tennis balls and dog toys).\n\nAlso, [early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) can help your dog develop into a well-mannered adult.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/chesapeake-bay-retriever/\n\nhttp://www.fci.be/Nomenclature/Standards/263g08-en.pdf\n\nhttps://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/dog-breeds/chesapeake-bay-retriever","reviewed-by":"Annette Louviere, DVM","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":21.8,"weight-range-pet-max":39.5,"weight-range-show-min":24.9,"weight-range-show-max":34.0,"height-range-min":53.0,"height-range-max":66.0,"life-span-range-min":10.0,"life-span-range-max":13.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":101,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":65,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":43},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/23450f66-935b-5f17-973d-47ca64134f9e/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/23450f66-935b-5f17-973d-47ca64134f9e/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/23450f66-935b-5f17-973d-47ca64134f9e/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/23450f66-935b-5f17-973d-47ca64134f9e/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/23450f66-935b-5f17-973d-47ca64134f9e/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/23450f66-935b-5f17-973d-47ca64134f9e/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/23450f66-935b-5f17-973d-47ca64134f9e/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/23450f66-935b-5f17-973d-47ca64134f9e/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/23450f66-935b-5f17-973d-47ca64134f9e/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/23450f66-935b-5f17-973d-47ca64134f9e/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/23450f66-935b-5f17-973d-47ca64134f9e/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/23450f66-935b-5f17-973d-47ca64134f9e/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/23450f66-935b-5f17-973d-47ca64134f9e/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/23450f66-935b-5f17-973d-47ca64134f9e/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/23450f66-935b-5f17-973d-47ca64134f9e/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/23450f66-935b-5f17-973d-47ca64134f9e/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/23450f66-935b-5f17-973d-47ca64134f9e/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/23450f66-935b-5f17-973d-47ca64134f9e/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"235529d3-54ec-527e-9bdb-cd569912a1bd","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/235529d3-54ec-527e-9bdb-cd569912a1bd"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"anatolian-shepherd-dog","name":"Anatolian Shepherd Dog","plural-name":"Anatolian Shepherd Dogs","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"While the breed’s ancestry dates back to the Babylonian Empire, today’s Anatolian Shepherd has its beginnings in Anatolia, a peninsula that includes the Asian portion of Turkey. There, in the harsh and unforgiving landscape, goat and sheep herders developed the breed as a guardian for their livestock, calling it the ‘Coban Kopegi,’ or the shepherd’s dog.\n\nBefore World War II, the United States Department of Agriculture imported a pair of Anatolian Shepherd Dogs from Turkey as part of a program to determine breeds best suited for work on sheep pastures. The onset of the war shifted focus from the so-called “Sheepdog Project,” and the Anatolian Shepherds found homes across the U.S.\n\nThe breed found its stride in the 1970s when Lieutenant Robert Ballard brought a pair of Anatolian Shepherds back to the U.S. from Turkey and began breeding them.\n\nThe institution of the Endangered Species Act in 1973 provided the Anatolian Shepherd with plenty of herding work; these formidable dogs used intimidation to scare off predators like wolves from the livestock they handled, rather than killing them.\n\nThe breed still works on many farms today in the U.S. and Turkey.","facts":"Anatolian Shepherd Dogs are serious, intelligent working dogs with protective instincts.\n\nKnown for their speed and agility when in the field, and their loyal and loving nature with their owners, they are wonderful and hardworking companion pets.","traits-appearance":"These large and impressive dogs have a rugged appearance that’s indicative of their working background. They are muscular and heavy-boned, with a strong head and almond-shaped eyes that convey their intelligence.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Anatolian Shepherd Dog has two coat variations, one short and one long, the long of which is referred to as rough. Both types have longer, thicker hair at the neck and mane, respective to the overall coat length.\n\nThey may have some feathering around their ears, legs, and tail, and they come in any color pattern and marking.","traits-physical":"The first thing most people notice about the Anatolian Shepherd Dog is their large, powerful appearance. They are a broad breed, with a well-muscled torso and strong head.","temperament":"The Anatolian Shepherd Dog is known to be loyal and calm, loving and devoted to their people, but they are very territorial, and they can be reserved and wary of strangers.\n\nThis breed only requires a moderate amount of exercise—so they’re well-suited to play in the yard or take long walks—but they have a strong urge to protect, so they should be kept on a leash or in a secured area at all times when they are outside.","care-nutrition":"As with most active breeds, the Anatolian Shepherd Dog does best with high-quality dog food that’s suited to their particular life stage.\n\nIt’s important to monitor the amount of food and treats that you give your Anatolian Shepherd Dog, especially since some dogs may be prone to gaining weight as they age.\n\nIn general, though, this breed isn’t traditionally known to overeat. Your veterinarian is always a good source to help provide you with appropriate nutrition and feeding guidelines.","care-grooming":"The Anatolian Shepherd is a working dog, which means they have a working dog’s coat. Their fur includes a thick, protective undercoat, as well as an outer coat that requires brushing once a week to stay healthy.\n\nYou can also expect your Anatolian Shepherd Dog to shed twice a year, during which time they will need more frequent brushing to remove loose and dead hair. Brushing their hair every few days during this time should help.\n\nAll dogs require regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care), including at-home teeth brushing and professional dental cleanings, and the Anatolian Shepherd Dog is no exception. Maintaining good dental hygiene is important for their overall long-term health.","care-exercise":"Although they are a working breed, the Anatolian Shepherd Dog requires only moderate exercise, especially compared to other shepherd breeds.\n\nA long walk or round of play in a fenced backyard is great for the breed. But, when outside, remember to always keep your Anatolian Shepherd on a leash or in a fenced area.","care-training":"Although loyal and loving with their people, the Anatolian Shepherd Dog can be wary towards others.\n\nBecause they have a history of being independent workers, they may be difficult to train. Early and proper [socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) is key.","care-health":null,"references":"http://asdca.org/anatolianshepherd.html\n\nhttps://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/anatolian-shepherd-dog/\n\nhttp://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/AnatolianShepherdDog.pdf","reviewed-by":"Cindy Elston, DVM, MPH","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":36.7,"weight-range-pet-max":66.7,"weight-range-show-min":39.9,"weight-range-show-max":64.9,"height-range-min":69.0,"height-range-max":76.0,"life-span-range-min":11.0,"life-span-range-max":13.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":100,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":63,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":41},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/235529d3-54ec-527e-9bdb-cd569912a1bd/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/235529d3-54ec-527e-9bdb-cd569912a1bd/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/235529d3-54ec-527e-9bdb-cd569912a1bd/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/235529d3-54ec-527e-9bdb-cd569912a1bd/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/235529d3-54ec-527e-9bdb-cd569912a1bd/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/235529d3-54ec-527e-9bdb-cd569912a1bd/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/235529d3-54ec-527e-9bdb-cd569912a1bd/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/235529d3-54ec-527e-9bdb-cd569912a1bd/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/235529d3-54ec-527e-9bdb-cd569912a1bd/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/235529d3-54ec-527e-9bdb-cd569912a1bd/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/235529d3-54ec-527e-9bdb-cd569912a1bd/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/235529d3-54ec-527e-9bdb-cd569912a1bd/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/235529d3-54ec-527e-9bdb-cd569912a1bd/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/235529d3-54ec-527e-9bdb-cd569912a1bd/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/235529d3-54ec-527e-9bdb-cd569912a1bd/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/235529d3-54ec-527e-9bdb-cd569912a1bd/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/235529d3-54ec-527e-9bdb-cd569912a1bd/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/235529d3-54ec-527e-9bdb-cd569912a1bd/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"2424b057-30e4-560a-b707-4dcc19c24c85","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2424b057-30e4-560a-b707-4dcc19c24c85"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"german-pinscher","name":"German Pinscher","plural-name":"German Pinschers","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"As one of Germany's oldest breeds, German Pinschers originally served as multi-purpose farm dogs—hunting, controlling vermin, and guarding the home. German Pinschers are exceptionally skilled ratters. Their ability to clear stables and kitchens of pests made them indispensable to German farmers.\n\nThe [Doberman Pinscher](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/dobermann-pinscher), [Miniature Pinscher](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/miniature-pinscher), and [Schnauzer](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/schnauzer-standard) all owe their existence to this intelligent and spirited dog—which experts believe is their common ancestor.","facts":"The German Pinscher is intelligent, curious, and energetic (to say the least). Dogs of this breed are happiest running free in the yard. They have playful personalities and absolutely love toys.","traits-appearance":"A substantial dog, the German Pinscher has a square build that is smooth, polished, and sleek.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The German Pinscher's coat may be completely reddish-brown or black with a reddish-brown muzzle, chest, and legs.","traits-physical":"German Pinschers move in a laid-back way that displays confidence. The breed's long, wedge-shaped head contains a pair of attentive and alert eyes. These medium-sized dogs are perfect for a household with a fenced yard where they can run at their leisure.","temperament":"A busy breed, the high-spirited German Pinscher might not be the best dog for every household. Though very affectionate and loving with family, the German Pinscher can be reactive toward perceived threats. On the other hand, this vigilance makes the breed well-suited for guarding.\n\nBut for these reasons, German Pinschers may not be very good with young children, and adult supervision is imperative for any interaction. German Pinschers also tend to bark at other dogs and do not always get along with other pets.","care-nutrition":"German Pinschers require a high-quality dog food that is age-appropriate—whether it's commercially manufactured or homemade (with a veterinarian's supervision and approval).\n\nIt's important to monitor the amount of food you give your German Pinscher. Reduce the portions or restrict calories if your pup gains weight. Also, remember that giving too many treats in addition to regular meals can contribute to obesity.","care-grooming":"The German Pinscher's short, dense coat needs minimal grooming. Weekly brushing and an occasional bath will keep your dog looking great.\n\nYou should trim your German Pinscher's nails monthly. If they become overgrown, your dog may experience pain or problems walking and running. Also, be sure to check your German Pinscher's ears weekly and clean as necessary.","care-exercise":"German Pinschers are athletic, nimble, and very energetic. As such, they need plenty of daily exercise for physical and mental health.\n\nWith a strong prey drive and high intelligence, German Pinschers are exceptional in competitions. They will take on almost any challenge with gusto—including canine sports such as obedience, agility, rally, and tracking.","care-training":"The German Pinscher has a stubborn streak. But you can overcome it with reward-based training methods. (So, get the treats and toys ready!)\n\nLabeled a \"thinking breed,\" German Pinschers sometimes become bored with monotonous obedience training and disobey commands. The solution is to mix up your approach and incorporate various activities.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/german-pinscher/\n\nhttps://www.google.com/books/edition/German_Pinscher/Zs8KBgAAQBAJ","reviewed-by":"Cindy Elston, DVM, MPH","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":10.9,"weight-range-pet-max":19.5,"weight-range-show-min":11.8,"weight-range-show-max":15.9,"height-range-min":43.0,"height-range-max":51.0,"life-span-range-min":12.0,"life-span-range-max":14.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":96,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":59,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":40},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2424b057-30e4-560a-b707-4dcc19c24c85/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2424b057-30e4-560a-b707-4dcc19c24c85/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2424b057-30e4-560a-b707-4dcc19c24c85/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2424b057-30e4-560a-b707-4dcc19c24c85/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2424b057-30e4-560a-b707-4dcc19c24c85/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2424b057-30e4-560a-b707-4dcc19c24c85/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2424b057-30e4-560a-b707-4dcc19c24c85/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2424b057-30e4-560a-b707-4dcc19c24c85/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2424b057-30e4-560a-b707-4dcc19c24c85/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2424b057-30e4-560a-b707-4dcc19c24c85/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2424b057-30e4-560a-b707-4dcc19c24c85/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2424b057-30e4-560a-b707-4dcc19c24c85/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2424b057-30e4-560a-b707-4dcc19c24c85/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2424b057-30e4-560a-b707-4dcc19c24c85/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2424b057-30e4-560a-b707-4dcc19c24c85/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2424b057-30e4-560a-b707-4dcc19c24c85/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2424b057-30e4-560a-b707-4dcc19c24c85/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2424b057-30e4-560a-b707-4dcc19c24c85/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"243f1a7b-fa24-5119-bf8a-17420fc6f1eb","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/243f1a7b-fa24-5119-bf8a-17420fc6f1eb"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"scottish-deerhound","name":"Scottish Deerhound","plural-name":"Scottish Deerhounds","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"These large dogs were identified as Deerhounds as early as the 16th century. As the name states, they excel at deer hunting, either coursing (chasing until their prey drops from exhaustion) or stalking (going after the deer once it has been wounded).\n\nScottish Deerhounds have always been associated with aristocracy, to the point where, in the Age of Chivalry, only Earls and above could own a Deerhound. This exclusivity actually hurt the breed, as it meant its breeding was closely restricted.\n\nAs the red deer began to disappear from England and Southern Scotland in the 18th century, the Deerhound was replaced with its smaller relative, the Greyhound. Luckily, there was still an active wild deer population in the Northern Highlands of Scotland, which became the last stronghold for the Scottish Deerhound. When the Highland chieftains claimed ownership of the breed, however, they applied the same exclusive restrictions on ownership. This resulted in the Deerhound again declining significantly until about 1825.\n\nAt that point the lineage was saved by breeders Archibald and Duncan McNeill, who were able to restore the Deerhound back to its former state. To this day it is still a rare and highly sought-after breed, known for its sense of smell, speed, and stamina. Hundreds of years of protecting and hunting for its masters has given the Scottish Deerhound a powerful desire for human companionship, and makes for an extremely loyal dog.","facts":"One of the tallest dog breeds, the Scottish Deerhound is also known as the “Royal Dog of Scotland.” Bred to hunt the giant wild red deer of Europe, the breed is as majestic as it is ancient.","traits-appearance":"A tall, majestic beast with a tapered head and long neck, this breed has a wiry coat in several colors.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Scottish Deerhound comes in many colors, with competitive breeders preferring the dark blue-grey. Other colors can include various shades of dark grey, grey, yellow, sandy red, or red fawn.","traits-physical":"One of the tallest dog breeds, this is a strong, fast, and agile sighthound. The Scottish Deerhound looks like a large Greyhound, which is a close relative. They both have a lithe, athletic build that gives off a powerful and very regal appearance.","temperament":"As their background suggests, Deerhounds have a very regal manner. You could almost consider them polite, but certainly with unique personalities. They are gentle and crave human companionship, though they can have their little quirks. In general, they do not tolerate being crated while their owner is at work.\n\nThese dogs are gentle, and can often be found lounging around the house, but they have large bursts of energy when exercising.","care-nutrition":"Scottish Deerhounds require a high-quality dog food that is age-appropriate—whether it’s commercially manufactured or homemade (with a veterinarian’s supervision and approval). It’s important to monitor the amount of food you give your Scottish Deerhound. Reduce the portions or restrict calories if your pup gains weight.\n\nYour veterinarian is always a good source to help provide you with appropriate nutrition and feeding guidelines.","care-grooming":"The Scottish Deerhound has a wiry, harsh coat that is easy to care for, and weekly brushing should be all that’s needed.\n\nAll dogs require regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care), including at-home teeth brushing and professional dental cleanings, and the Scottish Deerhound is no exception. Maintaining good dental hygiene is important for overall long-term health.","care-exercise":"This regal breed needs plenty of exercise to stay healthy and happy. Scottish Deerhounds require space to roam and exercise freely, and will appreciate long walks or jogs. The breed does tend to get lazier as they get older—as most dogs do—and you may need to pull them off of the couch. Even so, regular exercise is still very important in their older years.\n\nThey will also develop into healthier adults if they have a playmate to grow up with as a puppy.","care-training":"This is a sensitive and gentle breed that prefers positive training methods. The Scottish Deerhound responds to kind human companionship that will help it flourish into a healthy and happy adult dog. They are easily stressed, and should not be kenneled or crated at home during the day.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/scottish-deerhound/\n\nhttps://deerhound.org/\n\nhttps://deerhound.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/AKC-Deerhound-flyer-1.pdf","reviewed-by":"Annette Louviere, DVM","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":28.1,"weight-range-pet-max":54.9,"weight-range-show-min":32.7,"weight-range-show-max":49.9,"height-range-min":71.0,"height-range-max":76.0,"life-span-range-min":7.0,"life-span-range-max":11.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":100,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":63,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":41},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/243f1a7b-fa24-5119-bf8a-17420fc6f1eb/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/243f1a7b-fa24-5119-bf8a-17420fc6f1eb/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/243f1a7b-fa24-5119-bf8a-17420fc6f1eb/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/243f1a7b-fa24-5119-bf8a-17420fc6f1eb/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/243f1a7b-fa24-5119-bf8a-17420fc6f1eb/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/243f1a7b-fa24-5119-bf8a-17420fc6f1eb/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/243f1a7b-fa24-5119-bf8a-17420fc6f1eb/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/243f1a7b-fa24-5119-bf8a-17420fc6f1eb/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/243f1a7b-fa24-5119-bf8a-17420fc6f1eb/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/243f1a7b-fa24-5119-bf8a-17420fc6f1eb/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/243f1a7b-fa24-5119-bf8a-17420fc6f1eb/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/243f1a7b-fa24-5119-bf8a-17420fc6f1eb/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/243f1a7b-fa24-5119-bf8a-17420fc6f1eb/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/243f1a7b-fa24-5119-bf8a-17420fc6f1eb/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/243f1a7b-fa24-5119-bf8a-17420fc6f1eb/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/243f1a7b-fa24-5119-bf8a-17420fc6f1eb/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/243f1a7b-fa24-5119-bf8a-17420fc6f1eb/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/243f1a7b-fa24-5119-bf8a-17420fc6f1eb/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"247735d6-0c31-57ec-9113-76d9d72aa29e","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/247735d6-0c31-57ec-9113-76d9d72aa29e"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"european-wildcat-felis-sylvestris","name":"European Wildcat","plural-name":null,"published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"cat","history":"European Wildcats were once widespread throughout Europe.

The exact historical beginnings of the Afghan may never be understood—since they predate written history by thousands of years—but what is known is that these regal and athletic dogs were treasured hunting companions and a symbol of status for aristocrats, royals, and tribal chiefs in Asia’s mountain kingdoms.\n\nDespite its roots in ancient history, the Afghan Hound didn’t make it to Western society until the late 1800s, when English officers coming back to the British Empire brought the dogs with them. Once they arrived on the scene, the Afghan’s noble and loyal persona swiftly made it popular, and by the early 1900s it was the preferred breed for the British elite.\n\nIn the U.S. it still took a little while for the breed to catch on. The American Kennel Club registered the Afghan Hound in 1927, but it wasn’t until Zeppo Marx—of the Marx Brothers—began breeding a pair of Afghans he had brought back from England that the breed caught on in the States.","facts":"Dignified and independent, the Afghan Hound is a regal delight to its pet parents. It is lively and charming with loved ones, and a natural-born athlete: an energetic breed that needs lots of exercise to stay happy.","traits-appearance":"The Afghan Hound is a breed that exudes an aristocratic background. It is regal-looking and dignified, with a silky and flowing topknot, unique coat pattern, and prominent figures, like larger feet, protruding hip bones, and a curved tail.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Afghan Hound has a thick, silky, and flowing coat that consists of fine fur, as well as feathered ears and feet. Although the Afghan can come in any color, any white markings—especially around the head—are not desirable for show.","traits-physical":"It is easy to tell from just glancing at an Afghan Hound that they have a noble history. Their appearance of dignified aloofness is made prominent by their proudly carried head, curled tail, long silky topknot, prominent feet, protruding hip bones, and peculiar coat pattern.","temperament":"Afghan Hounds are loyal and devoted to their people. They may become attached to their people and surroundings and don’t do well when left alone or when their situations or routines change.\n\nThis dignified breed is sometimes wary of strangers and children. But Afghans do well with both given the proper training and socialization. They can also be independent and stubborn, so you should approach training thoughtfully.\n\nAs sighthounds, Afghans have a natural instinct to chase. For this reason, they should always be kept on a leash or in a fenced area when outside. The higher the fence the better, since they are great at jumping.\n\nThis breed is active and requires a lot of daily exercise to stay healthy and happy.","care-nutrition":"Part of the traditional Afghan Hound physique includes protruding hip bones, so it’s worth noting this isn’t usually a sign of malnourishment. This is, however, an active breed, so it’s important to ensure they are getting the appropriate number of calories every day to stay healthy.\n\nAfghan Hounds require a high-quality dog food that is age-appropriate—whether it’s commercially manufactured or homemade (with a veterinarian’s supervision and approval). It’s important to monitor the amount of food you give your dog. Reduce the portions or restrict calories if your pup gains weight.\n\nYour veterinarian is always a good source to help provide you with appropriate nutrition and feeding guidelines.","care-grooming":"Your Afghan’s coat is a hallmark of its beauty, and proper care should be taken to ensure it stays healthy. Although it’s not necessary to care for your Afghan Hound in the same manner as a show dog, keep in mind that for optimal coat care, show dogs have coats that are bathed and groomed twice a week.\n\nAfghans should be bathed prior to grooming, since brushing a dry coat can damage their hair, and it’s usually best to use a blow dryer (on a low setting) to completely dry your Afghan’s hair after a bath. When it is time to brush, use a large, oval pin brush, and a slicker for mats.\n\nAll dogs require regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care), including at-home teeth brushing and professional dental cleanings, and the Afghan Hound is no exception. Maintaining good dental hygiene is important for their overall long-term health.","care-exercise":"Regal though they are, the Afghan Hound is a very active breed that requires a lot of daily exercise to expend their energy and to remain happy and healthy. With their strong prey drive and excellent athletic abilities (they are fast runners and can jump very high), it’s important to always keep this dog on a leash or in a secure, high-fenced area when outside.","care-training":"The Afghan Hound has a personality that could go either way when it comes to training. They are independent and stubborn at times, but they are also loyal and eager to please with the people they love. Remember that no matter what level of training you introduce your Afghan Hound to, their instinct to hunt is strong, and they will likely always require a leash when playing outside in an unsecure area.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/afghan-hound/\n\nhttps://afghanhoundclubofamerica.org/index.php/information/common-questions","reviewed-by":"Annette Louviere, DVM","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":18.1,"weight-range-pet-max":34.9,"weight-range-show-min":20.4,"weight-range-show-max":29.9,"height-range-min":64.0,"height-range-max":74.0,"life-span-range-min":12.0,"life-span-range-max":15.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":92,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":55,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":37},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/24c7aa78-1e7d-5f4f-aa10-e928a34439c9/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/24c7aa78-1e7d-5f4f-aa10-e928a34439c9/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/24c7aa78-1e7d-5f4f-aa10-e928a34439c9/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/24c7aa78-1e7d-5f4f-aa10-e928a34439c9/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/24c7aa78-1e7d-5f4f-aa10-e928a34439c9/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/24c7aa78-1e7d-5f4f-aa10-e928a34439c9/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/24c7aa78-1e7d-5f4f-aa10-e928a34439c9/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/24c7aa78-1e7d-5f4f-aa10-e928a34439c9/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/24c7aa78-1e7d-5f4f-aa10-e928a34439c9/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/24c7aa78-1e7d-5f4f-aa10-e928a34439c9/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/24c7aa78-1e7d-5f4f-aa10-e928a34439c9/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/24c7aa78-1e7d-5f4f-aa10-e928a34439c9/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/24c7aa78-1e7d-5f4f-aa10-e928a34439c9/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/24c7aa78-1e7d-5f4f-aa10-e928a34439c9/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/24c7aa78-1e7d-5f4f-aa10-e928a34439c9/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/24c7aa78-1e7d-5f4f-aa10-e928a34439c9/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/24c7aa78-1e7d-5f4f-aa10-e928a34439c9/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/24c7aa78-1e7d-5f4f-aa10-e928a34439c9/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"24faaed9-242c-59a0-a631-220b49a74e38","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/24faaed9-242c-59a0-a631-220b49a74e38"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"kritikos-lagonikos","name":"Kritikos Lagonikos","plural-name":"Kritikou Lagonikou","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The Kritikos Lagonikos—or Cretan Hound—is originally from the island of Crete. Considered one of the oldest hunting breeds in Europe, it's been around for about 5,000 years! Artifacts from the ancient Aegean civilization (as well as Homer's epics) mention and picture the \"Kressai kynes,\" or Cretan Dog.\n\nThe Kritikos Lagonikos' sharp senses make the breed well-suited for hunting hares by sight or smell. (These dogs are known to \"suck\" scents out of the air or taste dirt while pursuing their prey.) Hunters appreciate the breed for its speed, agility, and quick mind.\n\nToday, it's rare to see the Kritikos Lagonikos outside of its native Crete.","facts":"The Kritikos Lagonikos is an elegant and gentle hound dog. These pups possess keen senses and a persistent, brave hunting style. At home, they make polite, affectionate companions.","traits-appearance":"The Kritikos Lagonikos is a medium-sized, primitive hound with an athletic build.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The breed's coat is very short, straight, and hard. It's thinner on the head, ears, and lower body, and longer on the neck, rear, and tail. The Kritikos Lagonikos comes in all colors and color combinations.","traits-physical":"These dogs have wedge-shaped heads, almond-shaped, dark eyes, triangular ears, long, rectangular bodies, and muscular legs. They carry their tails up in a half-circle or curved over the rear—with a hook at the end.","temperament":"The Kritikos Lagonikos is an obedient, mild-mannered dog that grows very attached to its people. These pups make expressive, loving companions and generally get along with other animals. But because of their intelligence and strong will, they're best suited for experienced owners.\n\nThis breed may be distrustful of strangers (but never aggressive). Socialization can help these dogs learn how to respond appropriately to different people and situations.\n\nThe Kritikos Lagonikos has a strong prey drive and loves to chase. That's helpful if you're hunting, but it can spell trouble for neighborhood cats or small animals entering the yard.","care-nutrition":"These dogs thrive on a diet formulated for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). A food made specifically for medium-sized breeds will have the appropriate blend of nutrients for their size and activity level.\n\nObesity in dogs can lead to serious health issues. So, carefully monitor the amount of food you give your pup, and don't forget to keep track of treats. As a rule, treats should make up no more than 10% of a dog's calories.","care-grooming":"Though the Kritikos Lagonikos does shed, the breed's coat is relatively low-maintenance. Brushing once or twice a week is usually enough to keep it free of loose hair and dirt. Trimming nails, cleaning ears, and brushing teeth should also be part of every dog's grooming routine, regardless of breed.","care-exercise":"The Kritikos Lagonikos is a high-energy breed with a lot of stamina. So, in addition to regular walks, these dogs need opportunities to run and engage in vigorous backyard games. (And if those games include chasing, all the better!)","care-training":"Attentive, curious, and eager to learn, the Kritikos Lagonikos tends to follow visual commands well, even from a distance. But because they're so smart, these pups can sometimes be willful. For a successful experience, train your Kritikos Lagonikos using a firm and consistent—but also positive and rewards-based—approach.","care-health":null,"references":"http://www.kretahund.de/kritikoslagonikos/standard/standardenglish/index.html\n\nhttps://www.dogbreedplus.com/dog_breeds/cretan_hound.php\n","reviewed-by":"Jamie Freyer, DVM","date-reviewed":"2020-09-05T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":15.0,"weight-range-pet-max":20.0,"weight-range-show-min":15.0,"weight-range-show-max":20.0,"height-range-min":51.0,"height-range-max":61.0,"life-span-range-min":12.0,"life-span-range-max":15.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":null,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":null,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":null},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/24faaed9-242c-59a0-a631-220b49a74e38/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/24faaed9-242c-59a0-a631-220b49a74e38/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/24faaed9-242c-59a0-a631-220b49a74e38/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/24faaed9-242c-59a0-a631-220b49a74e38/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/24faaed9-242c-59a0-a631-220b49a74e38/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/24faaed9-242c-59a0-a631-220b49a74e38/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/24faaed9-242c-59a0-a631-220b49a74e38/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/24faaed9-242c-59a0-a631-220b49a74e38/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/24faaed9-242c-59a0-a631-220b49a74e38/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/24faaed9-242c-59a0-a631-220b49a74e38/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/24faaed9-242c-59a0-a631-220b49a74e38/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/24faaed9-242c-59a0-a631-220b49a74e38/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/24faaed9-242c-59a0-a631-220b49a74e38/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/24faaed9-242c-59a0-a631-220b49a74e38/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/24faaed9-242c-59a0-a631-220b49a74e38/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/24faaed9-242c-59a0-a631-220b49a74e38/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/24faaed9-242c-59a0-a631-220b49a74e38/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/24faaed9-242c-59a0-a631-220b49a74e38/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"25137da1-712a-5a30-8186-95c47225d4d9","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/25137da1-712a-5a30-8186-95c47225d4d9"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"portuguese-podengo-pequenos","name":"Portuguese Podengo Pequeno","plural-name":"Portuguese Podengos Pequenos","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The Portuguese Podengo Pequeño is the smallest of the three varieties in the Podengo family. The other two are the [Portuguese Podengo Médio](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/portuguese-podengo-medio) (medium) and the Portuguese Podengo Grande (large).\n\nThe Podengo breed dates back thousands of years, originating in Asia Minor before the Phoenicians introduced it to the Iberian Peninsula. These dogs became very common in northern Portugal, where they have gained popularity as hunters and companions.\n\nUsing their keen senses, Portuguese Podengo Pequeños primarily hunted vermin and rabbits hiding underground. This talent earned them passage on the ships of many early explorers—including Vasco da Gama and Magellan—where they protected the food stores and sailors from rodent-borne diseases.\n\nThe first Portuguese Podengo Pequeño arrived in the U.S. in 1996. And in 2013, the breed attained full American Kennel Club recognition.","facts":"For its size, the Portuguese Podengo Pequeño is a tough and hearty little dog that loves playing games and making people laugh. There's something endearing about these pups that captures the heart of everyone they meet.","traits-appearance":"This Podengo Pequeño is built close to the ground and has a body that's a little longer than it is tall. The breed also has flexible little cat-like feet, a hardy coat, and a fantastic sense of hearing that allows it to plunge through thick brush while tracking prey.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Portuguese Podengo Pequeños come in two coat types: smooth and wire. Their coats are often light, medium, or dark yellow or fawn. But they may also be black or brown or have markings.","traits-physical":"The Portuguese Podengo Pequeño's distinctive characteristics are its wedge-shaped head that tapers toward the tip of the nose and a straight muzzle.","temperament":"Quiet, cheerful, and curious, the Podengo Pequeño relies on its smarts, speed, and sprightliness to hunt. They have short bursts of energy but are otherwise content curling up for a nap.\n\nPodengo Pequeños are loyal to their family members and tend to be friendly and loving toward most people. That said, they can be wary and a bit reserved with strangers. Overall, they are fun-loving and expressive little dogs that enjoy attention from their humans.","care-nutrition":"Portuguese Podengo Pequeños require a high-quality, age-appropriate diet. Be sure to monitor how much your Podengo Pequeño eats, and reduce portions if your pup gains excess weight. Also, remember that giving too many treats in addition to regular meals can contribute to obesity.","care-grooming":"To avoid tangles in the Podengo Pequeño's wire coat, routine brushing followed by a quick combing should do the trick. For the smooth-coated variety, an occasional wipe-down with a damp cloth should be adequate. Neither type requires haircuts.\n\nPortuguese Podengos also need periodic baths and monthly nail trims. It's also a good habit to inspect your dog's ears frequently for wax buildup and debris.\n\nFinally, all dogs need dental care, which should include daily teeth brushing and occasional professional cleanings. Maintaining good [dental hygiene](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) is essential for your pup's overall health.","care-exercise":"Little hunters that they are, Podengo Pequeños need daily exercise—whether it's in the form of a brisk walk or a romp around a secure, fenced-in yard.

Around this time, Queen Elizabeth bequeathed land in Wicklow to Flemish and Lowland soldiers who helped defeat an Irish rebellion.\n\nThese soldiers brought Flemish hounds with them when they settled in the new territory. Experts theorize these Flemish dogs then bred with local hounds and terriers, yielding the Glen of Imaal Terrier. Wicklow's mountainous terrain—where the dogs hunted fox and baited badgers— allowed the breed to develop and evolve separately from the standard [Irish Terrier](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/irish-terrier).\n\nInterestingly, Glen of Imaal Terriers sometimes worked in kitchens. They ran in hamster-wheel contraptions that turned meat over an open fire. This job earned the breed the nickname \"Turnspit Dogs.\"\n\nThe breed almost died out before being revived in the early 20th century by breeders in its homeland. Glen of Imaal Terriers received full recognition by the Irish Kennel Club in 1934 and the Kennel Club of England in 1975.","facts":"Hardy, alert, intelligent, feisty, independent... These are just a few of the words that describe the Glen of Imaal Terrier. Compared to most terriers, this breed is less excitable, but still confident, energetic, and ready for hard work.

It can be shades of wheaten (sandy to red wheaten), blue (gray), or brindle (shades of gray with tan or other color stripes).","traits-physical":"Notable traits of the Glen are its broad head with ears that fold over, bowed front legs, and harsh, wiry coat.","temperament":"The Glen of Imaal Terrier is an intelligent, high-spirited breed. These calm, gentle dogs are loyal and affectionate toward their families. They don't do well left alone for long periods. Glens want to be a part of all family fun—not left alone in the backyard.\n\nGlens are playful, amusing to watch, and good with children. But they can be unpredictable with other pets and might not get along well with other dogs. Compared to other terriers, they don't bark much.\n\nBehaviors to watch out for are chasing wildlife and digging. Because of their working dog backgrounds, Glen of Imaal Terriers can be challenging to distract once they're engaged in an activity.","care-nutrition":"Glen of Imaal Terriers require a high-quality dog food that is age-appropriate. Be sure to monitor the amount of food you give your Glen and reduce the portions if they gain weight. Also, remember that giving too many treats in addition to regular meals can contribute to obesity.","care-grooming":"This breed needs moderate weekly brushing to prevent the soft hair around the ears, neck, legs, and belly from matting.

The breed dates back to ancient China, where it was known as the “ha pa dog”—and later, the famous “foo dog”—and bred to resemble the lion as a sign of good luck.\n\nNobles kept Pekingese as pampered lapdogs. Sometimes called “sleeve dogs” because they could hide in the large sleeves of Chinese robes, Pekingese were accustomed to going everywhere with their doting owners. Palace eunuchs oversaw strict breeding programs, and Pekingese ownership was limited to those in the highest social classes. The dogs were so esteemed that commoners had to bow in their presence, and stealing a Pekingese was punishable by death.\n\nA British captain found five Pekingese dogs in a palace when troops invaded Peking (Beijing) in 1860. The dogs were transported back to England and given to Queen Victoria. These dogs with royal bearing fast became popular across Europe and, later, America. Ownership was once accessible to only the wealthiest families, but Pekingese are now among the most popular toy breeds.","facts":"Pekingese are little dogs with big personalities. Known as an independent, headstrong, and confident breed, Pekingese know just how to charm their ways into their family’s hearts.","traits-appearance":"The toy breed is small in stature with well-balanced proportions and a regal bearing. Pekingese are known for their “rolling” gait and bold demeanors.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Pekingese have thick, soft undercoats and long, straight, coarse-textured outer coats that stand off of their small bodies. Their hair is longest around the neck and shoulders, creating the “mane” that defines the breed. The forelegs, backs of the thighs, and toes have long feathering, and there is fringing on the ears and tail. The breed standard does not permit trimming their coats.\n\nPekingnese come in several colors with biscuit, black, black and tan, cream, fawn, fawn sable, red, gray, red sable, and white being the most common. The breed standard permits all colors and markings.","traits-physical":"Pekingese are a flat-faced breed. Their topskull is massive, broad, and flat. In profile, their faces are flat with the chin, nose, and brow all lying on one plane that slants back from chin to forehead.\n\nPekingnese also have heart-shaped ears that lie flat against their heads, large, dark, round, wide-set eyes with black rims, and wide, open nostrils. Their bodies are compact and low to the ground, and their tails have long, profuse straight fringing and are carried well over their backs.","temperament":"Pekingese have never forgotten their noble beginnings. These dogs are dignified, self-important, and intelligent. Although their owners often call them “opinionated,” Pekingese are not known for being big barkers. Their quiet natures make them popular as apartment dogs. These little pups can also learn to use indoor potty pads.\n\nPekingese might be small in size, but these dogs have big hearts. Consummate lapdogs, “Pekes” are loyal and affectionate with their owners. The breed tolerates gentle children but tends to develop a strong bond with a single person. They are suspicious of strangers, including unfamiliar dogs, but proper introductions can help them feel more at ease.\n\nThis breed is outgoing and alert and makes an effective little watchdog. However, their stubborn, willful natures can make Pekingese hard to train.","care-nutrition":"Feed Pekingese a high-quality dog food that is appropriate for their age and small size. To keep this breed from becoming overweight, portion out their food with a measuring cup to avoid overfeeding, and limit treats to no more than 10% of their daily calories.","care-grooming":"Pekingese have thick double coats that require regular grooming. Occasional baths (with conditioner) and brushing at least once per week can keep their hair from becoming tangled or matted. Pekingese will require almost-daily brushing during shedding season (in spring and fall) to help remove their dead coat.\n\nTheir nails need regular trimming to keep them from cracking, splitting, or becoming overgrown and making it painful to walk or run.\n\nStart a regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) routine when Pekingese are puppies. Brushing their teeth and scheduling professional cleanings ensures good oral hygiene throughout their lives.","care-exercise":"Pekingese do not require a lot of exercise. An occasional walk around the block or romp in a fenced yard are enough to satisfy these little dogs. Pekingese overheat easily and are not well-suited to vigorous exercise, especially during hot weather.\n\nProvide opportunities for mental and physical stimulation, such as games and puzzle toys, to keep this intelligent breed engaged and active. Some Pekingese may enjoy activities such as competitive obedience or agility.","care-training":"Pekingese are outgoing, intelligent, and loving—but also stubborn. This combination can make them both want to please their owners and unwilling to follow directions. A consistent training program that incorporates positive reinforcement and rewards can encourage this breed to participate in training sessions. Engage their outgoing personalities with group sessions and games.

They were larger with straight backs and gentle, stable temperaments. Tina first outcrossed her German shepherd dogs with a German Shepherd dog, [Malamute](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/alaskan-malamute), White Shepherd line bred for an American television show. She also introduced working Czech German Shepherd Dogs and dogs widely believed to have Altdeutscher Schäferhunde, [Czechoslovakian Vlcak](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/czechoslovakian-wolfdog), and [Sarplaninac](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/sarplaninac) lineage. These introductions allowed Tina to hone key features of the Shiloh while preserving the overall health of the gene pool.\n\nThe American Rare Breed Association (ARBA) first recognized the newly-founded breed. But today, the Shiloh remains relatively rare and has yet to gain recognition from major international breed registries.","facts":"The Shiloh Shepherd is an intelligent, gentle, people-oriented dog breed.

They have a balanced, athletic build that exudes power and elegance.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Shilohs come in two coat varieties: smooth and plush. Smooth-coated dogs have a thick, harsh double coat that lies close to the body. And the back of the legs has longer hair than the rest of the body. The plush coats, on the other hand, are not as coarse but still somewhat harsh. These dogs also have softer undercoats, longer manes, and pronounced feathering on the head, back of legs, and tail.\n\nThe Shiloh's coat comes in various colors—including shades of black with tan, golden tan, reddish tan, silver, and cream. Some Shilohs have a white blaze on the chest or white markings on the toes.","traits-physical":"The Shiloh's key features include a broad, noble head and stocky body with emphasis on efficient movement. This breed also has a well-developed jaw, wide and deep chest, straight back, full, bushy tail that hangs like a saber when relaxed, almond-shaped eyes, and erect, triangular ears.","temperament":"The Shiloh's gentle, steady temperament makes this breed an excellent option for families.

Shilohs have friendly personalities and get along well with other pets and children.\n\nThey love to work, play, and spend time with their people. But as such a social breed, they don't like being alone for long periods. Their calm nature makes Shilohs great candidates for therapy and service dog work.","care-nutrition":"Shiloh Shepherds thrive on a high-quality diet that's appropriate for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). They also benefit from foods formulated for large breeds—particularly when they're puppies. This helps prevent them from growing too fast and developing hip dysplasia as they age.\n\nBecause of their deep chests, these dogs are at a greater risk of bloat (also known as twisted stomach). To help prevent bloat, break your dog's food up into several meals a day, and use a food bowl designed to slow their eating. Also, avoid feeding immediately before or after any kind of vigorous activity. These are just a few ways you can help prevent this life-threatening condition.

Smooth-coated dogs shed continuously, whereas plush-coated dogs shed very little for most of the year. But both varieties blow their coats twice annually.

tumble Vendée region of France, where they came about as headstrong hunters with personalities suited to hard work. The PBGV’s rough coat protected them from the harsh location, while their extra facial hair also served to protect their face from the undergrowth.\n\nThe Club du Basset Griffon Vendéen created a breed standard for the PBGV in the early 20th century that included both the Grand and Petit version of the breed. In the 1950s, the PBGV received its official standard and recognition as a separate breed.\n\nToday, the PBGV is still a popular choice to hunt game in France, with different sizes to suit the specific prey they hunt.","facts":"Perhaps no other dog name quite describes the exact attributes of a breed the way Petit Basset Griffon Vendéen does. Roughly translated as “small,” “low-to-the-ground,” “rough-coated,” and “Vendéen” (the region of France from which the breed originated), these dogs are active and exuberant, outgoing and very friendly.","traits-appearance":"What the PBGV lacks in size, they make up for in stamina. Since the breed historically hunted small game over rough terrain, they are a shorter, compact breed with a robust construction and shaggy, rough fur.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Petit Basset Griffon Vendéen has a long, rough outer coat and a thick, shorter undercoat. Their coloring is white with any combination of lemon, orange, black, sable, tricolor, or grizzle markings.","traits-physical":"The shaggy PBGV has some endearing character traits like its long eyebrows, ears covered by long hair, and lips covered by a beard and mustache. Although cute, these facial features served a vital purpose back in their hunting days, helping to shield and protect their eyes from harsh undergrowth.","temperament":"The PBGV is considered a happy, active breed with a bubbly personality. They love to entertain and spend time with their families and are friendly toward both people and other dogs. Their hunting instinct is still strong to this day, so any time spent outdoors should be in a contained area or on a leash.\n\nThe PBGV is an active breed that requires plenty of exercise and attention to remain happy and healthy. They are known to have a strong sense of humor and an outgoing personality, and they get along well with people and other dogs.\n\nThese dogs can be loud at times, and they have a reputation for being difficult to train.","care-nutrition":"Feed your PBGV a high-quality dog food that’s suited to their particular age, activity level, and size, as well as any additional health concerns.\n\nSome members of this breed are prone to gaining weight, so it’s important to monitor the amount of food and treats that you give your PBGV to avoid having them become overweight, especially as they age. Your veterinarian is always a good source to help provide you with appropriate nutrition and feeding guidelines.","care-grooming":"The Petit Basset Griffon Vendéen has a fluffy coat that requires a bit of extra care when it comes to grooming. Their fur can be harsh and thick, so brushing through it at least once a week is necessary.\n\nAll dogs require regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care), including at-home teeth brushing and professional dental cleanings, and the Petit Basset Griffon Vendéen is no exception. Maintaining good dental hygiene is important for their overall long-term health.","care-exercise":"This active and curious dog requires a lot of exercise and room to explore. As with most hounds, their sense of smell and urge to hunt can get the best of them, so any outdoor activities need to be in a secure location or on a leash.\n\nThe PBGV’s robust build makes them excellent candidates for field events like agility, tracking, and scent work.","care-training":"PBGVs, while cute, have a reputation for being a bit difficult to train. Although they are smart, they are also very independent, and their hunting instinct is strong.\n\nEarly training and [socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) is important, and, if necessary, enlist a professional trainer to help.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.pbgv.org/\n\nhttps://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/petit-basset-griffon-Vendéen/\n\nhttp://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/PetitBassetGriffonVendéen.pdf","reviewed-by":"Laura Inman, DVM","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":11.8,"weight-range-pet-max":20.9,"weight-range-show-min":13.2,"weight-range-show-max":16.8,"height-range-min":33.0,"height-range-max":38.0,"life-span-range-min":10.0,"life-span-range-max":14.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":96,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":59,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":40},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/277d1675-1611-5ea8-a645-1346009bc69a/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/277d1675-1611-5ea8-a645-1346009bc69a/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/277d1675-1611-5ea8-a645-1346009bc69a/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/277d1675-1611-5ea8-a645-1346009bc69a/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/277d1675-1611-5ea8-a645-1346009bc69a/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/277d1675-1611-5ea8-a645-1346009bc69a/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/277d1675-1611-5ea8-a645-1346009bc69a/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/277d1675-1611-5ea8-a645-1346009bc69a/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/277d1675-1611-5ea8-a645-1346009bc69a/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/277d1675-1611-5ea8-a645-1346009bc69a/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/277d1675-1611-5ea8-a645-1346009bc69a/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/277d1675-1611-5ea8-a645-1346009bc69a/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/277d1675-1611-5ea8-a645-1346009bc69a/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/277d1675-1611-5ea8-a645-1346009bc69a/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/277d1675-1611-5ea8-a645-1346009bc69a/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/277d1675-1611-5ea8-a645-1346009bc69a/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/277d1675-1611-5ea8-a645-1346009bc69a/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/277d1675-1611-5ea8-a645-1346009bc69a/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"27cb1903-b4e9-5ab3-96e4-e348f0803587","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/27cb1903-b4e9-5ab3-96e4-e348f0803587"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"omani-street-cat","name":"Omani Street Cat","plural-name":null,"published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"cat","history":"Omani street cats likely evolved from landrace desert cats native to the Arabian Peninsula. Many of the feral cats roaming the streets in Oman are Arabian Maus—an ancient breed that only recently received recognition from the World Cat Federation.\n\nIn cities such as Muscat, Omani street cat populations are quite large. Because there is little support for these cats, animal advocates utilize trap, neuter, and release (TNR) programs to help keep homeless populations in check.","facts":"Omani street cats are feral cats that have adapted to an independent, outdoor life in hot, Middle Eastern environments.","traits-appearance":"Omani street cats come in all shapes and sizes. Cats resembling Arabian Maus are medium-sized and agile, with large, pointed ears.\n\nSigns of a life-long street cat include a well-kept coat (thanks to their meticulous grooming habits), protective body language, and lack of eye contact. Because they are intact, male street cats may have thick necks, muscular bodies, and scars from fighting.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Omani street cats' coats can come in all colors and patterns. They typically have short hair with no undercoat, which helps them avoid overheating in grueling summer weather.","traits-physical":"Omani street cats do not follow a breed standard. So, any combination of features is possible.","temperament":"Street cats often live in groups and congregate near food sources and shelter. Many cats are fearful of being handled or confined by humans. But some may adapt to interactions with people and learn to live indoors.","care-nutrition":"An Omani street cat's diet typically consists of whatever they can find—scraps from trash cans, birds and rodents, handouts from kind strangers, and so on. If you're leaving food out for a street cat, they will benefit from the same commercially prepared diets as pet cats.","care-grooming":"Street cats are typically effective self-groomers that keep their coats relatively clean. If you've taken in a street cat that will tolerate it, regular brushing and nail trims will help keep them in tip-top shape.","care-exercise":null,"care-training":null,"care-health":"Omani street cats are susceptible to the same diseases as pet cats—including rabies, distemper, feline immunodeficiency virus, and feline leukemia.

Though the St. Hubert’s Hound that resulted is now extinct, Basset Hounds still share several characteristics in common with their ancestor.\n\nThe Basset Hound made its way from France to England in 1866, and it was established in the United States by 1884. The American Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1885, and the Basset Hound Club of America formed in 1935.","facts":"The Basset Hound’s distinctly floppy ears and droopy eyes may draw you in. But their personality is what you’ll fall in love with. These friendly dogs tend to be calmer than most breeds. And though they’re sometimes hard-headed, you can lessen their stubborn tendencies with rewards-based training and motivational tools.","traits-appearance":"Perhaps one of the most recognizable breeds, the Basset Hound has a signature large, domed head, big paws, long droopy ears, and sad eyes that are covered with a wrinkled brow.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Basset Hound can be any hound color—including a variety of blacks, tans, and whites.

Their temperament, though friendly and affectionate—especially towards their masters—can be stubborn and disobedient at times. But overall, the Basset Hound is an excellent and popular pet.\n\nThough most Basset owners find their dogs to be calm and patient while at home, the breed’s hunting instincts can take over when they’re out in nature. Basset Hounds are very keen to follow scent trails, and their stubborn tendencies—combined with their loud bark—can make for interesting outings when they have hunting on the brain. (So, always leash your Basset Hound when in unfamiliar or non-contained areas.)","care-nutrition":"Basset Hounds should eat a high-quality diet that’s suited to their particular age, as well as any additional health concerns.\n\nIt’s always important to monitor the amount of food and treats that you give your dog. Since Basset Hounds aren’t quite as active as other breeds, they’re more at risk of weight gain. For appropriate nutrition and feeding guidelines, consult your veterinarian.","care-grooming":"Though the Basset Hound does have a short coat, the breed actually sheds frequently. So, regular grooming is important. Using a shedding tool at least once a week should help keep stray hairs at bay.\n\nIt’s also wise to clean a Basset’s ears weekly and ensure that their ears dry out fully. Likewise, check their eyes often, since their droopy nature makes it easy for debris to collect.\n\nAll dogs require regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care), including at-home teeth brushing and professional dental cleanings, and the Basset Hound is no exception. Maintaining good dental hygiene is important for their overall long-term health.","care-exercise":"Basset Hounds tend to be more laid back and less active than other breeds. But they do still require daily exercise to stay healthy. A moderate walk will usually do the trick, as will [games that you can play together](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/games-to-play-with-your-dog).","care-training":"The Basset Hound is a loyal and intelligent breed. But their stubborn, independent streak can get the best of them when it comes to training. Early and reward-based training with motivational tools—such as treats and favorite toys—can help. With the proper patience, this breed makes an excellent pet.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/basset-hound/\n\nhttps://www.prestigeanimalhospital.com/services/dogs/breeds/basset-hound","reviewed-by":"Cindy Elston, DVM, MPH","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":22.2,"weight-range-pet-max":34.9,"weight-range-show-min":24.9,"weight-range-show-max":29.9,"height-range-min":28.0,"height-range-max":38.0,"life-span-range-min":10.0,"life-span-range-max":13.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":109,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":71,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":42},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/280ea9a4-913b-5c4d-b1a0-6a3531082c43/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/280ea9a4-913b-5c4d-b1a0-6a3531082c43/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/280ea9a4-913b-5c4d-b1a0-6a3531082c43/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/280ea9a4-913b-5c4d-b1a0-6a3531082c43/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/280ea9a4-913b-5c4d-b1a0-6a3531082c43/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/280ea9a4-913b-5c4d-b1a0-6a3531082c43/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/280ea9a4-913b-5c4d-b1a0-6a3531082c43/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/280ea9a4-913b-5c4d-b1a0-6a3531082c43/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/280ea9a4-913b-5c4d-b1a0-6a3531082c43/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/280ea9a4-913b-5c4d-b1a0-6a3531082c43/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/280ea9a4-913b-5c4d-b1a0-6a3531082c43/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/280ea9a4-913b-5c4d-b1a0-6a3531082c43/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/280ea9a4-913b-5c4d-b1a0-6a3531082c43/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/280ea9a4-913b-5c4d-b1a0-6a3531082c43/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/280ea9a4-913b-5c4d-b1a0-6a3531082c43/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/280ea9a4-913b-5c4d-b1a0-6a3531082c43/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/280ea9a4-913b-5c4d-b1a0-6a3531082c43/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/280ea9a4-913b-5c4d-b1a0-6a3531082c43/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"28655c74-848d-51a2-95f4-8e4ced3f1744","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/28655c74-848d-51a2-95f4-8e4ced3f1744"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"akita","name":"Akita","plural-name":"Akitas","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The Akita, once known as Odate Inu, is a breed associated with myth and legend in Japan.\n\nAkitas originated in the Akita prefecture in northern Japan in the 1600s. It's said that an exiled nobleman there asked locals to breed a large hunting dog with a strong work ethic and the ability to take down big game—such as bears, wild boars, and deer. Before given an official breed name, these dogs were simply called \"snow country dogs\" because they came from the snowy, mountainous regions of Japan.\n\nHachiko is perhaps one of the most well-known Akitas. In the 1920s, the loyal companion accompanied his owner to the train station each morning and returned to meet his train each afternoon. According to legend, Hachiko returned to the station for nine years after his owner died, greeting the train each afternoon. Inspired by Hachiko's story, Helen Keller reportedly brought the first Akita to the United States in 1937.\n\nThe Akita approached extinction multiple times during its long history. Fortunately, a national breed club was established in Japan to ensure its survival in 1927. The Akita was named the national dog of Japan in 1931. And the working breed remains popular in Japan and around the world today.","facts":"The Akita is a strong, confident, profoundly loyal breed. These burly, double-coated dogs frequently serve as hunting dogs and guard dogs. Part of the working dog group, these quiet, often aloof pups, are affectionate with their owners. They thrive on human companionship—as long as those humans are part of their \"pack.\" ","traits-appearance":"Akitas are large and powerful dogs with short stature and thick muscles. They have broad heads, deep muzzles, erect ears, and fluffy, curled-over tails.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The dense coats of Akitas can be solid black, brown brindle, fawn, red, or white. They may also have brown/black, red/black, silver/black, or fawn/black overlay coloring. Akitas may have face masks, as well.","traits-physical":"The Akita's ears—small in comparison to their heads—stand stiffly upright. In addition to feet designed for walking in the snow, Akitas have strong front dewclaws to help them climb out of frigid waters.","temperament":"Akitas are fierce hunters that can be intensely loyal to their owners, earning them a reputation as excellent guard dogs. Because these dogs have strong protective instincts and bond to their owners, they may perceive strangers as a threat and exhibit aggressive behaviors. So, it's crucial to [socialize](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) Akitas to prevent their protective instincts from taking over.\n\nAkitas can also be aggressive toward other dogs—and dogs of the same sex, in particular. So, they often aren't the best breed to take to the dog park or doggie daycare. In fact, Akitas do best as the only dog in a home. Owners should supervise interactions with other dogs cautiously.","care-nutrition":"Akitas need a high-quality dog food that's appropriate for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). They'll also benefit from a diet formulated for large-breed dogs. Measuring their portions and monitoring their food intake can help keep Akitas from becoming overweight. Keep in mind that the strong guarding tendencies of Akitas may extend to their food. So, they should be fed alone—away from other animals and children.","care-grooming":"Double coats allow Akitas to withstand harsh temperatures. But they also require above-average grooming. Though the breed is low-shedding and Akitas groom themselves (as cats do), you should brush them at least once per week to remove loose fur. These dogs also blow their dense undercoats twice a year during seasonal shedding. So, get the vacuum cleaner ready.\n\nAs with all dogs, Akitas require regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care), including at-home teeth brushing and professional dental cleanings. Maintaining good dental hygiene is vital for their overall long-term health, and the sooner you get them into a good dental care routine, the better.","care-exercise":"Despite their strength and size, Akitas are well-suited to living in smaller spaces, such as apartments, because they aren't a highly active breed. A daily walk around the block is enough to wear out this working dog. But their strength and working dog tendencies make them ideally suited to sports such as carting, sledding, agility, and tracking.","care-training":"Akitas may be described as stubborn, independent, and willful. But they're also eager to please. For this reason, [house-training](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/potty-train-a-puppy) an Akita tends to be a snap.\n\nStarting a consistent training program when your Akita is a puppy is the key to ensuring they're responsive and well-trained into adulthood. And socialization will help your Akita better accept strangers.\n\nBecause of their strong prey drive, Akitas do best as the only pet in a home. And unless you want to see your Akita show their rebellious side, you should not let them off-leash in areas without secure fencing.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/akita/\n\nhttps://www.akc.org/expert-advice/lifestyle/akitas-10-facts-that-will-surprise-you/","reviewed-by":"Cindy Elston, DVM, MPH","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":27.2,"weight-range-pet-max":54.9,"weight-range-show-min":29.9,"weight-range-show-max":49.9,"height-range-min":61.0,"height-range-max":71.0,"life-span-range-min":10.0,"life-span-range-max":13.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":78,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":50,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":33},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/28655c74-848d-51a2-95f4-8e4ced3f1744/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/28655c74-848d-51a2-95f4-8e4ced3f1744/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/28655c74-848d-51a2-95f4-8e4ced3f1744/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/28655c74-848d-51a2-95f4-8e4ced3f1744/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/28655c74-848d-51a2-95f4-8e4ced3f1744/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/28655c74-848d-51a2-95f4-8e4ced3f1744/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/28655c74-848d-51a2-95f4-8e4ced3f1744/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/28655c74-848d-51a2-95f4-8e4ced3f1744/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/28655c74-848d-51a2-95f4-8e4ced3f1744/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/28655c74-848d-51a2-95f4-8e4ced3f1744/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/28655c74-848d-51a2-95f4-8e4ced3f1744/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/28655c74-848d-51a2-95f4-8e4ced3f1744/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/28655c74-848d-51a2-95f4-8e4ced3f1744/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/28655c74-848d-51a2-95f4-8e4ced3f1744/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/28655c74-848d-51a2-95f4-8e4ced3f1744/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/28655c74-848d-51a2-95f4-8e4ced3f1744/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/28655c74-848d-51a2-95f4-8e4ced3f1744/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/28655c74-848d-51a2-95f4-8e4ced3f1744/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"2872ff8e-22d5-5f93-9066-b2ac2822fb00","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2872ff8e-22d5-5f93-9066-b2ac2822fb00"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"english-shepherd","name":"English Shepherd Dog","plural-name":"English Shepherd Dogs","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"Don't let their name fool you—English Shepherds are an American original. The breed likely descends from English and Scottish shepherd dogs that early settlers brought to North America.\n\nBred to be all-around farm dogs, English Shepherds herded sheep and cattle, hunted vermin, and guarded property. Thanks to their versatility, they were among the most prominent breeds in the United States during the 19th and early 20th centuries. But as the farming industry grew larger and more specialized, the English Shepherd's skills became less valuable, and their numbers shrank.\n\nToday, the English Shepherd may not be as popular as other, more recognizable herding breeds, such as [Border Collies](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/border-collie) and [Australian Shepherds](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/australian-shepherd). But true fans remain devoted to this American workhorse.","facts":"English Shepherds are hardworking, intelligent farm dogs and devoted pets. As such, these high-energy pups make a great addition to active homes and outdoorsy families.","traits-appearance":"English Shepherds are medium-sized, alert-looking dogs built for speed and agility. They have sturdy, balanced bodies and harmonious proportions.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The English Shepherd has a thick, medium-length coat that can be straight, wavy, or curly. They also have furnishings under their bodies and on the upper half of their back legs. The backs of their front legs are feathered, and their tails are plumed.\n\nEnglish Shepherd coat patterns include black and white, black and tan, tricolored (black, white, and tan), sable and white, and tan and white. White trim may include a neck ring, blaze on the forehead, or a white patch on the chest.\n\nIn black and tan or tricolored dogs, tan trim appears on the cheeks, front legs, feet, and underside of the tail, as well as above the eyes, inside the hind legs, and as a chest bar.","traits-physical":"The English Shepherd's key features include dark or medium brown eyes, folded ears, a deep, powerful jaw, and a medium-length head that's slightly rounded between the ears. These dogs typically have moderately long tails, but natural bobtails occur and are accepted in the breed standard.","temperament":"English Shepherds are intelligent, gentle dogs that make great pets for active families. They get along well with other animals and children. But their natural herding tendency may lead them to corral other family members. English Shepherds can be wary of strangers. But with a bit of time, they typically warm up to newcomers.\n\nLike most herding dogs, these busybodies thrive when they have a job to do. Without enough activity and mental stimulation, they may get bored and look for ways to entertain themselves (e.g., digging through the trash, chewing on a favorite pair of slippers). Because of their high energy and exercise needs, this breed is not well-suited for apartment living or families looking for a couch potato.","care-nutrition":"English Shepherds do best on a high-quality diet formulated for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior) and energy level.\n\nObesity is a growing epidemic for dogs and can lead to other health challenges. To help your dog maintain a healthy weight, keep an eye on their food intake and measure their portions to avoid overfeeding. And don't forget to account for treats. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of a dog's daily calories.","care-grooming":"English Shepherds require regular brushing to keep their coats looking their best—especially during periods of seasonal shedding. Brush a few times a week to remove loose hair (and keep tufts from tumbling across your floors). Ear cleanings and nail trims should also be part of your dog's monthly grooming routine.\n\nDental disease is one of the most common health conditions in adult dogs and, left untreated, can lead to serious issues. So, in addition to professional dental cleanings, be sure to establish an [at-home dental care routine](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) that includes regular teeth brushing.","care-exercise":"English Shepherds are athletic, high-energy dogs. They need lots of exercise to be happy during the day and calm and relaxed at night. Long walks, jogs, trail hikes, and backyard play sessions are excellent ways to help them release pent-up energy. They also make great agility dogs and shine in canine sports that allow them to show off their physical and mental abilities.","care-training":"English Shepherds are extremely intelligent—which can be both a blessing and a curse when it comes to training. On the one hand, they easily learn obedience commands and tricks. But on the other, they may have strong ideas about how things should be done.\n\nYou can overcome this potential stubborn streak through firm and consistent training methods.

Some dogs have pink skin around the muzzle and nose.","traits-physical":"A long, oval-shaped head, upright and pointed ears, and small, triangular eyes are signature characteristics of the Bull Terrier.","temperament":"Bull Terriers typically have playful personalities. They’re charming and can be mischievous—in an almost clownish or comical way. Though they can be headstrong at times, Bull Terriers make devoted, lifelong companions. They're very loyal to their people and usually good with children. (That said, all dogs need careful supervision when around kids.)\n\nThese pups may be unpredictable or unfriendly toward dogs or other pets. Interaction with strangers, however, shouldn’t be a problem. Bull Terriers are very sociable dogs, and they quickly accept others if introduced appropriately.\n\nBull Terriers can become destructive if left home alone for long periods. They may also develop food aggression in multi-pet households. But with proper supervision and training, they usually get along well with non-human family members. Because of their stubborn and independent nature, Bull Terriers require patient, reward-based training methods.","care-nutrition":"Bull Terriers thrive on a high-quality diet that is age-appropriate—whether commercially produced or homemade (with approval and guidance from a veterinarian).\n\nThis breed is prone to obesity, so it’s important to monitor the amount of food you give them. If your pup gains excess weight, reduce their meal portions or cut back on treats.","care-grooming":"The Bull Terrier’s coat requires little maintenance to stay in tip-top shape. Weekly brushing with a soft-bristle brush, hound glove, or rubber grooming mitt/tool will help remove loose hair.\n\nRegular nail trimming is a must for Bull Terriers. Overly long nails can cause pain, and may even contribute to walking and running problems.\n\nLastly, aim to establish a routine of at-home teeth brushing to support your dog's dental health between professional cleanings.","care-exercise":"Bull Terriers like to play and require moderate amounts of physical exercise and mental stimulation. Long walks around the neighborhood with the family or active games should do the trick. Standard-sized Bull Terriers make good jogging partners, too.\n\nBecause of their strength and athletic ability, Bull Terriers also tend to enjoy dog sports such as agility, flyball, rally, and competitive obedience.","care-training":"Both [early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) and gentle (but firm) training are essential for bringing out the Bull Terrier’s best qualities. This breed is inclined to guard, so focus on tempering this tendency to maintain a safe household.\n\nBull Terriers often prefer frivolous and fun activities over working dog jobs.  A great way to [start a training routine](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-obedience-training) with your pup is to use positive reinforcement along with patience and humor.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/bull-terrier/\n\nhttps://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/miniature-bull-terrier/\n\nhttps://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/dog-breeds/miniature-bull-terrier","reviewed-by":"Annette Louviere, DVM","date-reviewed":"2021-07-09T19:21:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":10.0,"weight-range-pet-max":37.2,"weight-range-show-min":10.9,"weight-range-show-max":31.8,"height-range-min":25.0,"height-range-max":46.0,"life-span-range-min":10.0,"life-span-range-max":14.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":null,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":null,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":null},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2946f757-27f1-5c01-ae09-4f7e605d9464/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2946f757-27f1-5c01-ae09-4f7e605d9464/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2946f757-27f1-5c01-ae09-4f7e605d9464/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2946f757-27f1-5c01-ae09-4f7e605d9464/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2946f757-27f1-5c01-ae09-4f7e605d9464/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2946f757-27f1-5c01-ae09-4f7e605d9464/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2946f757-27f1-5c01-ae09-4f7e605d9464/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2946f757-27f1-5c01-ae09-4f7e605d9464/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2946f757-27f1-5c01-ae09-4f7e605d9464/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2946f757-27f1-5c01-ae09-4f7e605d9464/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2946f757-27f1-5c01-ae09-4f7e605d9464/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2946f757-27f1-5c01-ae09-4f7e605d9464/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2946f757-27f1-5c01-ae09-4f7e605d9464/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2946f757-27f1-5c01-ae09-4f7e605d9464/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2946f757-27f1-5c01-ae09-4f7e605d9464/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2946f757-27f1-5c01-ae09-4f7e605d9464/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2946f757-27f1-5c01-ae09-4f7e605d9464/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2946f757-27f1-5c01-ae09-4f7e605d9464/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"29587b49-0030-54f6-9b04-da3551769bfa","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/29587b49-0030-54f6-9b04-da3551769bfa"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"european-shorthair","name":"European Shorthair","plural-name":null,"published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"cat","history":"The European Shorthair is a direct descendant of ancient Rome's common domestic cat. This ancestor accompanied Roman soldiers to protect food supplies from rodents as they traveled across Europe. Known for their keen hunting skills, European Shorthairs played a critical role as vermin controllers and farm cats in early settlements.\n\nThe breed developed naturally for hundreds of years, unencumbered by breeding rules. It wasn't until the 20th century that Swedish breeders—hoping to preserve the cats' original Roman look—created the first breed standard.\n\nThe Federation Internationale Féline (FIFe) recognized the European Shorthair in 1992. No U.S. cat clubs currently recognize the breed. But it remains very popular in Scandinavia and is the national cat of Finland.","facts":"European Shorthairs are intelligent, loyal, and playful cats that adapt well to most environments and situations. These qualities make them an excellent fit for young families, seniors, and everything in between.","traits-appearance":"European Shorthairs are medium-to-large cats. They have a robust, muscular build with a well-developed chest and sturdy legs.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The European Shorthair's coat—which comes in almost all colors and patterns—is glossy, dense, and close-lying, with little undercoat. Not included in the breed standard are the sepia, mink, and colorpoint patterns, as well as chocolate, lilac, cinnamon, and fawn.","traits-physical":"European Shorthairs have slightly rounded skulls, well-developed cheeks, and tails that are thick at the base and taper to a rounded tip. Their ears are as tall as they are wide, with slightly rounded tips, and they can be tufted. The breed's medium-to-large round eyes come in green, amber, blue, or odd eye (one blue and one amber).","temperament":"European Shorthairs are adaptable and easily adjust to any environment. They are friendly cats that enjoy the company of other cats, people (including kids), and respectful dogs. But they can be a little shy around strangers and may initially hide until they feel it's safe to come out and socialize.\n\nEuropean Shorthairs maintain a playful, kitten-like attitude their whole lives. They're also a very intelligent breed. So, giving them food puzzles and interactive toys will help them stay both physically and mentally fit.\n\nTrue to their roots, European Shorthairs will hunt small animals if given a chance. For this reason, you'll want to keep pocket pets—such as guinea pigs or hamsters—at a safe distance. If left outside, these natural hunters will also likely target mice and birds.","care-nutrition":"European Shorthairs require a high-quality diet. Because nutritional needs vary for kittens, adults, and senior cats, opt for a formula that's age-appropriate for your pet.\n\nTo keep your cat at a healthy weight, monitor food intake and reduce portions if necessary. And be mindful of calories if you decide to give them human food as a treat. Just one small piece of cheese can account for half their recommended daily calories. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of a cat's daily intake.\n\nFinally, every cat needs easy access to fresh, clean water at all times.","care-grooming":"European Shorthairs are skilled self-groomers. But they still need weekly brushing to keep their coats free of loose hair.\n\nRegular nail trims will prevent your cat's claws from growing too long, snagging on something, and becoming torn or damaged. (Long nails can also grow into their paw pads, leading to pain or infection.) If you provide a scratching post, your kitty will likely do their own part to keep their nails healthy, thanks to their natural desire to scratch.\n\nGood dental hygiene is essential to every cat's overall health. So, beginning in kittenhood, start your European Shorthair on a dental routine that includes at-home teeth brushing and professional exams and cleanings.","care-exercise":null,"care-training":null,"care-health":"Roughly one out of every three cats in the United States is overweight or obese.

And with a protective nature and tendency to bark, the Toy Fox Terrier also makes an excellent watchdog.","traits-appearance":"A balanced and athletic dog, the Toy Fox Terrier is both nimble and strong.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Toy Fox Terrier's close, smooth coat is mostly white with black, tan, black and tan, chocolate, or chocolate and tan patches.","traits-physical":"Large, upright ears, dark eyes, and a sleek, satin coat are among the Toy Fox Terrier's unique features.","temperament":"Toy Fox Terriers are good-natured, playful, loving, and loyal toward their people. And when socialized in puppyhood, the breed is also generally friendly around other pets and well-behaved children.\n\nThat said, Toy Fox Terriers can be unpredictable with other dogs, and they love to bark and dig.","care-nutrition":"Toy Fox Terriers require a high-quality, age-appropriate (e.g., puppy, adult, senior) diet. To prevent weight-related health problems, monitor how much your Toy Fox Terrier eats, and reduce portions if necessary. Also, remember that giving too many treats can contribute to obesity.","care-grooming":"Though they do shed, Toy Fox Terriers need little grooming. Regularly brushing or combing your dog's short coat (and giving occasional baths) is usually adequate.\n\nTrimming nails, cleaning ears, and [brushing teeth](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) should also be part of your pup's grooming routine.","care-exercise":"Speedy and agile, Toy Fox Terriers have a seemingly boundless supply of energy. They're considered one of the most athletic of the smaller breeds and excel at canine sports—such as agility, flyball, and tracking.\n\nBut be sure to always keep your Toy Fox Terrier on a leash when not safely in your home or fenced yard.

As its name suggests, the breed hails from Tibet, China—where it was called Do-Khyi, or \"tied dog.\" This was a reference to the common practice of tying guard dogs to the gates during the day before letting them loose to roam (and protect) the villages at night.\n\nThroughout history, other mastiff breeds traveled alongside the Persians, Greeks, and Romans—as well as Atilla the Hun and Genghis Khan. But Tibetan Mastiffs remained in the Himalayan Mountains, where they guarded tents and protected their owners from wolves, snow leopards, and other predators. As a result of this isolation, the Tibetan Mastiff was a rare breed. And it wasn't included in a book of pedigrees until 1873, despite evidence of its existence centuries earlier.","facts":"Due to their sheer size, it should come as no surprise that the Tibetian Mastiff was bred to guard properties. Though they remain protective, these dogs are actually gentle giants—mellow, loving, and devoted to their families.","traits-appearance":"Tibetan Mastiffs are massive, athletic dogs with a solemn yet kind appearance.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Tibetan Mastiffs have a double coat. The dense, soft undercoat becomes sparse in warmer months. And the long, thick outer coat is straight—never curly or wavy—and feels hard, not silky. These dogs have more abundant hair on their neck and shoulders, giving them the appearance of a mane. Dense, heavily feathered hair covers their tails and haunches. Males have more abundant coats than females.\n\nThe Tibetan Mastiff's coat may be several colors, including black, brown, and blue-gray. Tan markings—which range from light silver to mahogany—can appear around the eyes, muzzle, throat, lower-front forelegs, rear legs from hocks to toes, and underside of the tail. On gold dogs, sabling in a saddle-marked pattern is also acceptable by show standards. White markings on the chest and feet are also common.","traits-physical":"Tibetan Mastiffs have broad heads with substantial back skulls, deep-set, almond-shaped eyes, and full, square muzzles. Their tails are well-feathered and curl over their backs. This surprisingly agile breed also has \"cat feet\" that are large, strong, and might have feathering between the toes.","temperament":"The same qualities that made the Tibetan Mastiff an excellent guard dog in ancient times remain hallmarks of their temperament today. They tend to be reserved, protective of their families, and aloof with strangers. The breed can also be independent, strong-willed, and territorial. The Tibetan Mastiff's tendency to bark—especially if left outdoors overnight—makes it a better fit for rural life, where it won't annoy close neighbors.\n\nThough Tibetan Mastiffs are devoted to their owners, they aren't overly affectionate. They may also be possessive of food or toys. Proper introductions to children, unfamiliar guests, and other animals are essential.","care-nutrition":"Tibetan Mastiffs do not have big appetites for such large dogs. In fact, some eat as little as two cups of food per day. And it's not uncommon for them to skip meals altogether. When females are in season, intact males may go up to a week without eating, losing as much as 15% of their body weight in the process.\n\nWhen choosing a dog food, seek out a high-quality product that is appropriate for your pup's life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). Also, consider opting for a diet specially formulated for large-breed dogs.","care-grooming":"During seasonal shedding periods when they blow their coats, Tibetan Mastiffs require almost daily grooming with a de-shedding tool to remove the undercoat. But the rest of the year, a weekly brushing to remove dirt, debris, and tangles is sufficient. The breed standard does not allow the clipping or trimming of the coat.\n\nTrimming nails and [brushing teeth](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) should also be part of your Tibetan Mastiff's grooming routine.","care-exercise":"Tibetan Mastiffs require moderate exercise. Though typically uninterested in organized activities, such as fetch or flyball, this breed enjoys patrolling its territory. A large, fenced yard is the ideal place for a Tibetan Mastiff to roam.\n\nNot known for their endurance, Tibetan Mastiffs prefer a short, brisk walk to a long, slow stroll. And they tend to be most active in cooler weather.","care-training":"As Tibetan Mastiff owners may attest, this breed might just be too smart. These dogs learn fast but bore just as quickly. And they're prone to disobey commands in favor of their own instincts. For training success, focus on positive reinforcement and reward-based methods. But keep in mind that even well-trained Tibetan Mastiffs may lack reliable recall. So, you should never let the breed off-leash in unsecured areas.\n\nTibetan Mastiffs might not excel at following commands. But at least they're clean dogs, making them easy to housebreak!","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.tibetanmastiff.org/brief-history.html\n\nhttp://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/TibetanMastiff.pdf\n\nhttps://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/tibetan-mastiff/","reviewed-by":"Annette Louviere, DVM","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":40.8,"weight-range-pet-max":63.5,"weight-range-show-min":63.5,"weight-range-show-max":77.1,"height-range-min":64.0,"height-range-max":71.0,"life-span-range-min":10.0,"life-span-range-max":15.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":100,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":63,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":41},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2a674c13-c5c5-5594-ad14-b7aa5f5fc7ad/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2a674c13-c5c5-5594-ad14-b7aa5f5fc7ad/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2a674c13-c5c5-5594-ad14-b7aa5f5fc7ad/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2a674c13-c5c5-5594-ad14-b7aa5f5fc7ad/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2a674c13-c5c5-5594-ad14-b7aa5f5fc7ad/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2a674c13-c5c5-5594-ad14-b7aa5f5fc7ad/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2a674c13-c5c5-5594-ad14-b7aa5f5fc7ad/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2a674c13-c5c5-5594-ad14-b7aa5f5fc7ad/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2a674c13-c5c5-5594-ad14-b7aa5f5fc7ad/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2a674c13-c5c5-5594-ad14-b7aa5f5fc7ad/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2a674c13-c5c5-5594-ad14-b7aa5f5fc7ad/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2a674c13-c5c5-5594-ad14-b7aa5f5fc7ad/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2a674c13-c5c5-5594-ad14-b7aa5f5fc7ad/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2a674c13-c5c5-5594-ad14-b7aa5f5fc7ad/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2a674c13-c5c5-5594-ad14-b7aa5f5fc7ad/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2a674c13-c5c5-5594-ad14-b7aa5f5fc7ad/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2a674c13-c5c5-5594-ad14-b7aa5f5fc7ad/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2a674c13-c5c5-5594-ad14-b7aa5f5fc7ad/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"2abe792e-98e2-5eae-be96-320c31350e16","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2abe792e-98e2-5eae-be96-320c31350e16"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"maltese","name":"Maltese","plural-name":"Maltese","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"Hailing from Malta, Maltese have impressive histories that are said to go back twenty-eight centuries. The breed was most likely introduced to Malta by the Phoenicians, who ruled the Mediterranean. These little dogs achieved instant popularity. The Roman Emperor Claudius, and Publius, the Roman Governor of Malta, each owned a Maltese. Publius was said to be so devoted to his pet that he created art and poetry to immortalize the dog. Depictions of Maltese also appear on ceramics from the Golden Age.\n\nSome believed Maltese were able to cure ailments. Owners often let the dogs sleep on the pillows next to them to take advantage of their healing properties. The breed later became a status symbol and fashion statement. Roman women were said not to be fully dressed without a Maltese peeking out from their garments.\n\nChinese breeders kept the Maltese from extinction after the fall of Rome. Their efforts to improve the dogs by crossing them with their native toy breeds led to a more refined breed. The \"new\" Maltese returned to Europe, where the dogs fast became the breed of choice for British aristocrats. The Maltese also became popular at dog shows. In 1877, the \"Maltese Lion Dog\" was shown at the first Westminster show in New York. They remain among the American Kennel Club's top 40 most popular dog breeds.","facts":"Maltese are big bundles of energy in little bodies. This toy breed has been charming owners with their lively, playful personalities for centuries. Known for being affectionate and outgoing, Maltese make excellent family pets.","traits-appearance":"Maltese are head turners with their small statures and long, silky, white hair. They are light on their feet with jaunty gaits and lively movements.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Maltese are known for the long, flat, silky hair that covers their bodies, reaching almost to the ground. There are no signs of curliness, kinkiness, or woolly texture in the hair. Some owners choose to tie the hair on the top of the head into a topknot. Pure white hair is the standard, though light tan or lemon on the ears is possible.","traits-physical":"This toy breed has a compact body that is as long as it is tall. Maltese have sloping shoulders, deep chests, fine-boned, nicely feathered legs, and small, round feet. Their noses are black, and their eyes dark and round, giving them an alert but gentle expression.","temperament":"Maltese are small dogs with big personalities. Their fearlessness makes them great miniature alarm systems. Though they can be bold (and occasionally stubborn), Maltese are responsive, trusting, and affectionate with their families.\n\nThis breed is one of the more gentle-mannered toy dogs, but they have plenty of pep. Maltese are playful and vigorous and make wonderful family pets. They love to make friends with people and pets—and can quickly turn anyone unfamiliar with the breed into an enthusiastic fan.\n\nMaltese can be energetic and love bounding around the yard or trotting around town but still appreciate a good cuddle. Thanks to their small size and quiet, adaptable natures, Maltese do well in apartments (and purses).","care-nutrition":"Maltese require high-quality dog food that's appropriate for their breed size and life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). Monitor their food intake to keep them from becoming overweight. Extra calories add up fast for such a tiny dog. Portion out their food with a measuring cup and limit treats to no more than 10% of their daily calories.","care-grooming":"Though Maltese are a low-shedding breed, maintaining their beautiful coats still requires regular grooming. Occasional baths (with conditioner) and daily brushing can keep their hair from becoming tangled or matted.\n\nMaltese have fast-growing nails that require regular trimming to keep them from cracking, splitting, or causing pain when they walk or run.\n\nStart a regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) routine when Maltese are young. Brushing their teeth and scheduling professional cleanings ensures good oral hygiene throughout their lives.","care-exercise":"Although Maltese are a moderately active breed, an occasional walk around the block or play session in a fenced yard is usually enough to tire them out. Provide opportunities for mental stimulation, such as games and puzzle toys, to keep these intelligent pups engaged and active. Despite their small size, Maltese are surprisingly athletic and enjoy activities such as competitive obedience or agility.","care-training":"Maltese are smart and stubborn, which means they can be easily trained but may not want to follow directions. A consistent training program that incorporates positive reinforcement and rewards can encourage them to participate in training sessions. To engage their outgoing personalities, try group sessions and games. Regular [socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) is also important to help them feel comfortable with unfamiliar people, pets, and places.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/maltese/\n\nhttp://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/Maltese.pdf","reviewed-by":"Annette Louviere,

Dachshund","plural-name":"Longhaired Dachshunds","published-at":null,"species":"dog","history":"The Dachshund dates back to the 15th century. Many believe the breed originated in Germany, though some evidence suggests it was also present in Greece, Egypt, China, and Mexico. Originally bred to hunt badgers, Dachshunds were also successful big-game hunters.\n\nEver wondered why Longhaired Doxies have such different coats from their close cousins—the [Shorthaired](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/dachshund-shorthaired) and [Wirehaired](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/dachshund-wirehaired)? Two theories on the origin of the standard longhaired variant exist.\n\nThe first speculates that Shorthaired Dachshunds sometimes spontaneously produced puppies that had longer hair than their parents. And breeders then used those pups in selective breeding programs to consistently produce longhaired litters. The other theory proposes that the longhaired variant came from crossing Shorthaired Dachshunds, various small land and water spaniels, and the German Stoberhund.\n\nThe Longhaired Dachshund came to the United States in 1885 and received American Kennel Club recognition that same year. The German Dachshund Club was founded in 1888.","facts":"The Longhaired Dachshund is an alert, lively, and active breed. These beautiful, spunky dogs tend to be protective of their family, making them vigilant watch dogs. They may be small, but Doxies have big personalities.","traits-appearance":"The Longhaired Dachshund's famously long body and short legs earned the breed the humorous nicknames \"hot dog\" and \"wiener dog.\" But the elegance and beauty of these little dogs is no joke.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Longhaired Dachshunds come in various colors, including solid or bicolor combinations of light and dark black, red, and tan shades. Brindle and dapple patterns are also possible. This breed's long hair is especially noticeable on its ears, chest, and tail. And some Longhaired Doxies have blue eyes.","traits-physical":"It's easy to recognize Longhaired Dachshunds by their long-backed bodies, pointy noses, and short (but powerful) legs.","temperament":"The Longhaired Dachshund is a friendly, affectionate breed that wants to spend its time surrounded by family—not one that likes to be left alone outdoors.\n\nBecause of their background as hunting dogs, Doxies may bark, scratch at the ground, dig, or chase wildlife. They may also be suspicious or fearful of strangers. In some cases, this is because they're trying to avoid being picked up, which can cause discomfort to their long-backed body.","care-nutrition":"Dachshunds need a high-quality dog food that is appropriate for their age and breed size. It's critical that this breed not become overweight. In addition to other health concerns, any extra weight strains their long backs, potentially leading to disc problems.","care-grooming":"Longhaired Dachshunds are a clean breed, with little or no smell. Brushing requirements depend on coat thickness: Thicker coats need more frequent brushing to keep hair free from tangles and control the moderate shedding.\n\nYou should trim your Dachshund's nails every month to keep them at an appropriate length. Overgrown nails can cause pain or lead to issues walking.","care-exercise":"Due to their build, not every activity is appropriate or safe for Longhaired Dachshunds. Long runs, hurdling fences, and vigorous swims are out of the question. That said, this active breed is always ready to get moving.\n\nDoxies need regular exercise to stay in shape and build the muscles needed to protect their backs. To prevent injuries, avoid activities that involve stair climbing or jumping.","care-training":"Because of their strong hunting instinct and independent nature, Longhaired Dachshunds may not always follow instructions. With their keen sense of smell and strong prey drive, they may choose instead to pick up a scent and follow it. Patience is a virtue while training a Doxie. A kind tone and positive, reward-based approach are the best tools for training these sensitive dogs.\n\nLonghaired Dachshunds can be quite protective of their family and territory. [Socializing them as puppies](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) will ensure they develop into well-mannered adult dogs.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/dachshund/","reviewed-by":"Annette Louviere, DVM","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":5.9,"weight-range-pet-max":14.5,"weight-range-show-min":4.5,"weight-range-show-max":13.6,"height-range-min":20.0,"height-range-max":28.0,"life-span-range-min":12.0,"life-span-range-max":16.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":88,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":54,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":40},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2bb0727a-75e0-53f4-a8a3-6b0cef18ad5b/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2bb0727a-75e0-53f4-a8a3-6b0cef18ad5b/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2bb0727a-75e0-53f4-a8a3-6b0cef18ad5b/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2bb0727a-75e0-53f4-a8a3-6b0cef18ad5b/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2bb0727a-75e0-53f4-a8a3-6b0cef18ad5b/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2bb0727a-75e0-53f4-a8a3-6b0cef18ad5b/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2bb0727a-75e0-53f4-a8a3-6b0cef18ad5b/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2bb0727a-75e0-53f4-a8a3-6b0cef18ad5b/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2bb0727a-75e0-53f4-a8a3-6b0cef18ad5b/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2bb0727a-75e0-53f4-a8a3-6b0cef18ad5b/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2bb0727a-75e0-53f4-a8a3-6b0cef18ad5b/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2bb0727a-75e0-53f4-a8a3-6b0cef18ad5b/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2bb0727a-75e0-53f4-a8a3-6b0cef18ad5b/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2bb0727a-75e0-53f4-a8a3-6b0cef18ad5b/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2bb0727a-75e0-53f4-a8a3-6b0cef18ad5b/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2bb0727a-75e0-53f4-a8a3-6b0cef18ad5b/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2bb0727a-75e0-53f4-a8a3-6b0cef18ad5b/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2bb0727a-75e0-53f4-a8a3-6b0cef18ad5b/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"2be29a1b-2067-502f-8e69-3796e86fb2ef","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2be29a1b-2067-502f-8e69-3796e86fb2ef"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"big-cats","name":"Big Cats","plural-name":null,"published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"cat","history":"The mysterious origins of Big Cats continue to unfold to this day. Until recently, the oldest Big Cat fossils—dating back 3.8 million years—came from Africa. However, in 2013 researchers discovered a fossil believed to be 5.95 million years old in the Himalayas, suggesting Big Cats actually originated in Asia.\n\nThe Big Cat family includes Lions, Tigers, Leopards, Jaguars, and Clouded Leopards. The first four are members of the genus **Panthera**, whereas the Clouded Leopard is part of the larger subfamily of **Pantherinae**. Their habitats span regions in Asia, Africa, and North and South America.\n\nToday, Siberian Tigers are the most endangered Big Cat. But all are under threat due to environmental factors, poaching, and human-animal conflict.","facts":"Big Cats are some of the most breathtaking animals on the planet. Though their individual characteristics vary, they share a common ability to captivate humans with their beauty, grace, and mystique.","traits-appearance":"Big Cats vary in size and appearance. Siberian Tigers are the biggest of the group, topping out at 660 pounds. On the other hand, the smallest—Clouded Leopards—can reach 50 pounds.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Big Cats come in various coat colors and patterns. Jaguars, Leopards, and Clouded Leopards all have spotted coats. All three also have ground colors that come in shades of yellow—though the Jaguar also comes in a black variation.\n\nTigers have tawny or white-colored coats and black vertical stripes. Both male and female lions have tawny-colored coats that provide camouflage. Male lions also have trademark shaggy manes that come in blond, reddish, or black.","traits-physical":"Though features vary by species, all Big Cats have muscular bodies, powerful teeth and jaws, and sharp retractable claws.","temperament":"Lions are the only Big Cat species that live in groups. Known as prides, these groups include related females, their offspring, and some adult males. The rest of the Big Cats are solitary animals that live and hunt independently (unless it's mating season).\n\nIf kept in captivity, Big Cats require large outdoor enclosures where they can roam freely. These spaces should have covers over the top and sides that extend several feet below the surface. In addition to space for physical exercise, Big Cats need plenty of mental stimulation to keep them from getting bored.\n\nIt's also important to remember that all Big Cats are predators. Even if they do not act overly aggressive, their sheer size and strength can pose a fatal threat to humans.","care-nutrition":"Like all felines, Big Cats are carnivores, and their diets consist mainly of meat. Depending on their location, they eat everything from antelopes and baby elephants to birds and lizards.","care-grooming":"Big Cats groom themselves to keep clean and remove their scent—which helps keep potential prey from detecting them.","care-exercise":null,"care-training":null,"care-health":"In captivity, Big Cats need many of the same vaccines as domestic cats to protect them from common feline diseases. However, they require a veterinarian trained and licensed in exotic animal

Ocelot, Pampas Cat, Rusty-spotted Cat, Tigrina, Caracal, Canada Lynx, Andean Mountain Cat, and African Golden Cat. Though they may not all share the same genus, they all belong to the **Felinae** subfamily.\n\nThe Felinae subfamily originated in Eurasia about 10 million years ago. This grouping of wild cats now primarily inhabits parts of Central and South America. However, some live in other parts of the world. For example, the Marbled Cat resides in Southeast Asia, and the Caracal resides in Africa.\n\nThese days, habitat loss, hunters, poachers, and other human influences all pose a risk to many Small Wild Cats populations.","facts":"Small Wild Cats include tiny species, such as the Kodkod, and medium-sized wild cats, such as the Ocelot and Caracal.","traits-appearance":"Small Wild Cats vary in size and appearance. Ocelots are the largest species and can weigh up to 35 pounds, whereas Rusted Spotted Cats—the world's smallest wild cat—weigh just three pounds.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"These wild cats come in assorted colors, patterns, and coat lengths.

Bred as livestock guardians, Kuvaszok (the plural of Kuvasz) moved across wide expanses of rugged terrain, watching their flocks and defending against predators.\n\nThe fierce protectors attracted the attention of Hungarian King Matthias I, who appreciated their strength, skill and courage, and made them a fixture of his palace. Legend says that the monarch trusted his Kuvaszok more than his palace guards.","facts":"The Kuvasz is a fearless livestock guardian that makes a vigilant watchdog. These fierce protectors are energetic, alert, and powerful but also sweet-natured with their families.","traits-appearance":"Kuvaszok are large, muscular dogs that are strong, agile, and quick on their feet. These medium-boned dogs show no hint of bulkiness.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Kuvaszok have double coats, composed of fine undercoats and medium-coarse outer coats with guard hairs that range from straight to wavy. Their hair is short and smooth on their heads, muzzles, ears, front of the forelegs and hindlegs, and paws; it is longer on their necks, forming a mane that covers the chest. The backs of their forelegs and tails have significant feathering that can grow up to six inches long. The length of the coat changes with the seasons; Kuvaszok tend to lose most of their long hair during hot weather.\n\nKuvaszok have white coats. Their skin is heavily pigmented with the breed standard favoring slate gray or black pigmentation.","traits-physical":"Kuvaszok are large dogs with a rectangular shape; their withers are higher than their backs, their shoulders are muscular and long, and their thighs are muscular and strong, allowing them to move with a free, easy gait.\n\nKuvaszok have beautiful heads with elongated skulls, lean muzzles, V-shaped ears with slightly rounded tips, and almond-shaped, dark brown eyes set well apart.","temperament":"The same traits that made Kuvaszok prized livestock guardians also make them devoted watchdogs. These pups are intelligent, determined, courageous, and have strong protective instincts. Kuvaszok will do anything to keep their homes and families safe. They are especially protective of children.\n\nThanks to their strong protective instincts, the breed can be standoffish with strangers. Kuvaszok take cues from their owners and will be polite with accepted strangers.\n\nKuvaszok might not be overly affectionate but these dogs develop intense bonds with their families.","care-nutrition":"Feed Kuvaszok a high-quality dog food that is appropriate for their life stage (puppy, adult, senior) and consider a diet formulated for active breeds. Portion out their food with a measuring cup and limit treats to no more than 10% of their daily calories to avoid overfeeding. Kuvaszok, like other large breed dogs, are at higher risk for bloat. Offering several small meals per day (as opposed to a single large meal) could reduce the risk.","care-grooming":"Brush Kuvasz coats at least once per week to remove dead hair. These dogs will shed during semi-annual “shedding seasons” and daily brushing is essential to remove all of the dead hair. Occasional baths will keep Kuvaszok clean and smelling fresh.\n\nRegular ear cleaning and nail trimmings to prevent cracking, splitting, and painful overgrowths are important and regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) that includes at-home teeth brushing","care-exercise":"Kuvaszok were bred as working dogs and thus require daily exercise. These dogs love spending time with their owners and will see exercise as a bonding experience. Invite them along on hikes or bike rides. Regular walks or games of fetch or hide and seek in a fenced backyard are also a great way to provide the mental and physical stimulation that Kuvaszok need to be healthy and happy.","care-training":"Kuvaszok mature slowly and require consistent training, starting when they are puppies, to help them grow into well-mannered dogs. The smart, eager-to-please breed requires patient owners willing to use positive reinforcement and rewards, not harsh training techniques, to help them master basic commands and learn new tricks. Socialization is essential to help these dogs temper their guarding instincts and feel more comfortable with strangers.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/kuvasz/\n\nhttp://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/Kuvasz.pdf","reviewed-by":"Cindy Elston, DVM, MPH","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":27.7,"weight-range-pet-max":55.3,"weight-range-show-min":29.9,"weight-range-show-max":52.2,"height-range-min":66.0,"height-range-max":76.0,"life-span-range-min":10.0,"life-span-range-max":12.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":100,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":63,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":41},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2dde500b-674e-561a-bea0-63b8e30bd17c/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2dde500b-674e-561a-bea0-63b8e30bd17c/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2dde500b-674e-561a-bea0-63b8e30bd17c/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2dde500b-674e-561a-bea0-63b8e30bd17c/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2dde500b-674e-561a-bea0-63b8e30bd17c/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2dde500b-674e-561a-bea0-63b8e30bd17c/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2dde500b-674e-561a-bea0-63b8e30bd17c/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2dde500b-674e-561a-bea0-63b8e30bd17c/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2dde500b-674e-561a-bea0-63b8e30bd17c/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2dde500b-674e-561a-bea0-63b8e30bd17c/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2dde500b-674e-561a-bea0-63b8e30bd17c/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2dde500b-674e-561a-bea0-63b8e30bd17c/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2dde500b-674e-561a-bea0-63b8e30bd17c/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2dde500b-674e-561a-bea0-63b8e30bd17c/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2dde500b-674e-561a-bea0-63b8e30bd17c/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2dde500b-674e-561a-bea0-63b8e30bd17c/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2dde500b-674e-561a-bea0-63b8e30bd17c/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2dde500b-674e-561a-bea0-63b8e30bd17c/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"2df72f06-0c86-5cd2-92d5-3d450f2fda54","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2df72f06-0c86-5cd2-92d5-3d450f2fda54"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"khaomanee","name":"Khaomanee","plural-name":null,"published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"cat","history":"The Khaomanee is one of several breeds that originated in ancient Thailand. Early references to the breed—whose name translates to \"white gem\"—exist in The Cat Book of Poems written in the 14th century.\n\nWhile other Thai cat breeds (e.g., Siamese, Burmese, Korat) gained global notoriety, the Khaomanee lived in relative obscurity to the outside world. But interest in the breed began to grow starting in 1999—when Colleen Freymouth imported a pair of Khaomanee to the United States and bred the first North American litter.\n\nToday, this rare breed is working toward full recognition with both the Cat Fanciers Association and The International Cat Association.","facts":"Khaomanee cats are intelligent, social, and known for entertaining their humans with silly antics. According to people in their native Thailand, they also bring good luck to those who share their home. What more could you ask for from a loyal companion?","traits-appearance":"The Khaomanee is a medium-sized breed built for Thailand's warm climate. These cats have lithe bodies, medium-length noses (that handle hot air better than short noses), and short white coats.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Khaomanee cats come primarily in pure white. Other colors are possible, but they're not allowed under the breed standard. Their eyes are shades of blue, gold, green, or odd-eyed (two different colors). And their fine, medium-short coat is smooth enough to see muscles beneath the hair and has a somewhat sparse undercoat.","traits-physical":"Other prominent features of the Khaomanee include a heart-shaped head, high cheekbones, large, upright ears, and a medium-length, tapering tail.","temperament":"Khaomanee cats are known for their playful, mischievous personalities. They're very people-oriented and take it upon themselves to greet all visitors that come to the house. They also make devoted family members and willing playmates for kids.\n\nThese curious, intelligent cats like to explore their surroundings and excel at games of fetch. They tend to be vocal and aren't shy about letting their humans know what they're thinking. But they also know how to relax and enjoy taking breaks on a nearby couch or—better yet—a lap.","care-nutrition":"Khaomanee require a high-quality diet. Because nutritional needs vary for kittens, adults, and senior cats, opt for a formula that's age-appropriate for your pet.\n\nTo keep your cat at a healthy weight, measure out meals and reduce portions if necessary. And don't forget to account for treats. As a guideline, they should make up no more than 10% of a cat's calories.\n\nFinally, all cats need access to fresh, clean water around the clock.","care-grooming":"The Khaomanee's short coat is relatively low maintenance. Weekly brushing to remove dirt and loose fur will keep it shining white.\n\nMost cats' nails require monthly trimming to prevent them from getting too long. Long nails are more likely to snag on something and become torn or damaged. They can even grow into your cat's paw pads, leading to pain or infection. In addition to clipping, providing a scratching post will allow your cat to do some nail maintenance themselves (thanks to their instinct to scratch).\n\nNo grooming routine is complete without a little dental hygiene. To support your Khaomanee's overall health, brush their teeth daily and schedule visits with your veterinarian for professional dental cleanings and exams.","care-exercise":null,"care-training":null,"care-health":"Roughly one out of every three cats in the United States is overweight or obese. And those extra pounds can contribute to other health risks—such as arthritis, diabetes, and heart problems.

Terrier","plural-name":"Boston Terriers","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The Boston Terrier can trace its history back to 1865-era Boston, Massachusetts. Coachmen for the wealthy residents of Boston would crossbreed their employers' dogs for pit-fighting purposes. The cross of an English Bulldog with an English White Terrier (now extinct) resulted in the first iteration of what would become the Boston Terrier.\n\nAs dogfighting became illegal and unpopular, people began to consider the Boston Terrier as a companion animal because it exhibited a notable devotion to its master.\n\nNowadays, Boston Terriers make wonderful family dogs. They've grown popular in the United States and abroad. Because of their rather small size, they're particularly well-suited for smaller homes or apartments. Though the breed had been established and loved for quite some time, the American Kennel Club officially recognized the Boston Terrier in 1893.","facts":"Boston Terriers are lively and clever dogs that make excellent pets and devoted companions. They are gentle and friendly to children, other pets, and strangers.","traits-appearance":"Boston Terriers are small, sturdy, muscular little dogs—compactly built, short-tailed, and well-balanced. They have a broad, flat-nosed face without wrinkles and a slightly arched, prominent neckline with a full chest, similar to the [Boxer](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/boxer).","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Boston Terrier has a sleek, fine coat with markings that resemble a stylish tuxedo. The breed's white paws and chest are complemented by black, brindle, or seal (i.e., black with a red cast when viewed in the sun or bright light).","traits-physical":"Boston Terriers have square heads, upright ears, short, broad muzzles, and large, round eyes.","temperament":"The Boston Terrier gets along with just about everyone. In fact, the breed's nickname is \"The American gentleman\" because of its tender disposition.\n\nBoston Terriers are also very affectionate and love receiving attention from their human family. Though they can be a bit stubborn, they're very friendly to other pets and people.","care-nutrition":"Boston Terriers need a high-quality dog food that is age-appropriate. As you should with any dog, be sure to monitor the amount of food your Boston Terrier consumes and reduce the portions if your pup gains weight. Also, remember that giving too many treats in addition to regular meals can contribute to obesity.","care-grooming":"The Boston Terrier sheds somewhat frequently. Weekly brushing with a soft-bristle brush, rubber grooming mitt/tool, or hound glove will remove loose hair while promoting new hair growth. Doing this also distributes skin oils throughout the coat to keep it healthy.\n\nBaths are only needed occasionally unless your dog gets particularly dirty. But regular nail trimming is a must because overly long nails can cause the dog pain—as well as problems walking and running.","care-exercise":"Active and playful to the point of rambunctious, Boston Terriers enjoy activities that test their agility, tracking, and obedience skills, such as flyball and rally.\n\nExercise needs vary from dog to dog. Some need only a brisk walk a couple of times per day, whereas others want time to run and play. But if left for long periods or deprived of the opportunity to let out some energy, all Boston Terriers have the potential to get flustered and develop unwanted behaviors.","care-training":"The Boston Terrier is very intelligent and relatively easy to train. They love to learn and respond well to vocal instructions.

Shepherd","plural-name":"Pyrenean Shepherds","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"Pyrenean Shepherds trace their origins back to the Pyrenees Mountains along the border between France and Spain. There, the dogs earned their name, navigating rugged terrain to move sheep between grazing areas.\n\nAccording to local lore, Pyrenean Shepherds were the original dogs of cavemen who lived in the mountainous region. Historical accounts cite Pyrenean Shepherds and shepherds working side-by-side throughout Medieval times.\n\nThe dogs often worked in tandem with Great Pyrenees; the Great Pyrenees guarded flocks, and then the Pyrenean Shepherds moved them. During World War I, the small, surefooted breed worked in the military as couriers and search and rescue dogs.\n\nThanks to their skills during the war, Pyrenean Shepherds and Great Pyrenees lovers founded a club dedicated to the breeds' preservation: Reunion des Amateurs des Chiens Pyreneens. The French Kennel Club recognized the Pyrenean Shepherd as a breed in 1926.","facts":"The Pyrenean Shepherd is an affectionate, enthusiastic breed. These bundles of energy are always ready for outdoor adventures.","traits-appearance":"Pyrenean Shepherds are small, lean, sinewy dogs. These dogs are energetic, athletic dogs that move with flowing gaits and a mischievous attitude to match their stamina.\n\nPyrenean Shepherds are always on alert and ready for action.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"There are two different varieties of Pyrenean Shepherds: rough-faced and smooth-faced. Both varieties have hair that's almost flat or slightly wavy; their hair's texture is harsh and described as being between the wool of a sheep and the hair of a goat.\n\nRough-faced dogs have long or demi-long coats. Dogs with long hair have more furnishings, and their woollier hair may cord, especially on the elbows, rump, and thighs. Dogs with demi-long hair have culottes on their backsides.\n\nOn smooth-faced dogs, short, fine hairs cover the muzzle. It grows longer on the sides of the head, blending into a modest ruff. Smooth-faced Pyrenean Shepherds have fine, soft hair on their bodies that grows to a maximum of three inches long on the ruff and culottes and two inches long on the back.\n\nPyrenean Shepherds come in various shades of fawn from tan to copper, shades of grey from charcoal to silver to pearl grey, and merles of diverse tones. Their coats can also be brindle, black, and black with white markings (though the white should not cover more than 30 percent of their bodies).","traits-physical":"These small dogs have long bodies with level backs; short, rounded loins; and sinewy forelegs. Their tails may be docked, natural bob, or long.\n\nPyrenean Shepherds have straight, narrow muzzles and can have cropped or uncropped ears that are wider at the base and stand erect. They have dark brown, almond-shaped, expressive eyes that lend an intelligent, alert, mischievous expression.","temperament":"Pyrenean Shepherds love to work. These intelligent, curious dogs have such strong herding instincts that they can often manage flocks without training from a shepherd or guidance from an experienced dog.\n\nIn the absence of work, Pyrenean Shepherds need other opportunities to channel their energy and owners must be prepared to provide plenty of exercise.\n\nPyrenean Shepherds develop strong attachments to their owners and want to be part of all activities; it's not a breed that wants to be left home while their families are out having fun.\n\nThey are loving, cheerful, and affectionate with those they know, but these dogs are also wary of strangers, making them ideal watchdogs.","care-nutrition":"Feed Pyrenean Shepherds a high-quality dog food that is appropriate for their life stage (puppy, adult, senior). Consider a diet formulated for active breeds.\n\nPortion out their food with a measuring cup and limit treats to no more than 10 percent of their daily calories to avoid overfeeding your Pyrenean Shepherd.","care-grooming":"Pyrenean Shepherds require regular grooming. Brush them once per week to keep their hair free of mats and tangles. Use a pin brush to remove dead undercoat, reduce shedding, and keep their coats looking their best.\n\nPyrenean Shepherds also need regular nail trims, ear cleanings, and a regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) routine that includes at-home teeth brushing and professional cleanings.","care-exercise":"These on-the-go dogs require a lot of exercise. In the absence of work, Pyrenean Shepherds enjoy walking, hiking, swimming, and other outdoor adventures that will help them burn off their abundant energy. Exercise is essential for their mental and physical health.\n\nPyrenean Shepherds also do well in dog sports such as obedience competitions, agility, and lure coursing.","care-training":"Pyrenean Shepherds are smart, active, and eager to please. They respond well to clicker training and other rewards-based training.\n\nTeaching Pyrenean Shepherds basic commands and new tricks will provide mental stimulation that helps keep the breed happy and healthy.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/pyrenean-shepherd/\n\nhttp://www.pyrshepclub.org/breed-info/history/\n\nhttps://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/PyreneanShepherd.pdf","reviewed-by":"Cindy

Chuvach","plural-name":"Slovakian Chuvaches","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The Slovakian Chuvach has a history that begins with Arctic wolves. Preserved remains of these wolves have appeared in mountainous regions of Europe, including the Balkans, the Carpathians, the northern slopes of the Caucasus, the Pyrenees, the northern slopes of the Abruzzi, and the Alps.\n\nThe Slovakian Chuvach (or Tatra Chuvach, as they were called back in the day), protected sheep and other animals for Slovak alpine farmers. They acted as watch and guard dogs for their mountain-dwelling people, in both herding and military capacities. Besides their ability to keep a watchful eye, the Slovakian Chuvach proved to be excellent companions, and they were able to work the cattle and drive poultry, as well.\n\nEventually the breed started to gain popularity, as visitors took notice of thsee beautiful and useful dogs. This is how the Slovakian Chuvach was introduced from the mountains to the lowlands. In the early 1900s, the Stud Book for the Tatra Chuvach in Czechoslovakia was founded, and the club for Tatra Chuvach breeders continues to keep records and show the dogs all throughout the region.","facts":"Bred in harsh mountainsides, the Slovakian Chuvach is ready for anything. This breed is alert and fearless, courageous, and ready to fight off anyone (or any animal) that comes into their territory. They are fiercely loyal and protective of their people, and can be wary of strangers, but when they are with people they know, Slovakian Chuvachs are faithful and lively.","traits-appearance":"The Slovakian Chuvach appears similar to a mountain dog, with a large, muscular body and thick coat. It is strong-boned and lively, with a broad forehead and low-set tail.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"This breed has a thick and dense coat with short, close hair on the head and legs, and slightly longer hair on the rear side of the legs. The hair is wavy mostly on the mane. Its undercoat is made of dense, fine hair. This breed is solid white in color.","traits-physical":"The Slovakian Chuvach has traits that are similar to a typical mountain dog, with its big-boned, muscular structure, but its striking white coat sets it apart.","temperament":"If you’re looking for an excellent guard dog, the Slovakian Chuvach has its roots in watchmanship. They are suspicious of strangers, and aggressive when they feel like they need to be, although with their own family they are loyal and loving. When given the proper amount of room to roam and explore, and the right amount of exercise, they make excellent family pets. They continue to excel as livestock guardians.","care-nutrition":"Slovakian Chuvachs require a high-quality dog food that is age-appropriate—whether it’s commercially manufactured or homemade (with a veterinarian’s supervision and approval). It’s important to monitor the amount of food you give your Slovakian Chuvach. Reduce the portions or restrict calories if your pup gains weight. Your veterinarian is always a good source to provide you with appropriate nutrition and feeding guidelines.","care-grooming":"The Slovakian Chuvach has a glorious white coat that is dense and wavy, and requires a little bit of extra care. Weekly grooming can help keep stray hairs at bay, but the breed also should get regular baths to help its coat remain in top shape.\n\nAll dogs require regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care), including at-home teeth brushing and professional dental cleanings, and the Slovakian Chuvach is no exception. Maintaining good dental hygiene is important for its overall long-term health.","care-exercise":"Although the Slovakian Chuvach was bred as a working dog, and they are apt at chasing and wrangling livestock, they are less energetic than many similar breeds. Daily exercise that they might enjoy could include time with their pet parents in the yard, chasing balls or Frisbees, swimming, or taking walks. This is an intelligent breed that would also do well with dog sports like agility and rally.","care-training":"Slovakian Chuvachs are smart, but they can be independent. They tend to bark, and they are highly suspicious of strangers; they may even become aggressive as they feel uncertain or uncomfortable. Early and proper training and socialization is very important with this breed. Unfortunately, training may be difficult with this dog, so working with a professional is often necessary. They tend to learn best with positive reinforcement training methods.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/slovensky-cuvac/\n\nhttps://www.forloveoflivestock.com/blog/slovensky-cuvac-livestock-guardian-dog-breed\n\nhttp://www.fci.be/Nomenclature/Standards/142g01-en.pdf","reviewed-by":"Cindy Elston, DVM, MPH","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":30.8,"weight-range-pet-max":44.0,"weight-range-show-min":30.8,"weight-range-show-max":44.0,"height-range-min":58.0,"height-range-max":70.0,"life-span-range-min":11.0,"life-span-range-max":13.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":85,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":54,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":39},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2f3d9f78-a5cd-5207-b27f-b675672bb844/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2f3d9f78-a5cd-5207-b27f-b675672bb844/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2f3d9f78-a5cd-5207-b27f-b675672bb844/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2f3d9f78-a5cd-5207-b27f-b675672bb844/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2f3d9f78-a5cd-5207-b27f-b675672bb844/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2f3d9f78-a5cd-5207-b27f-b675672bb844/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2f3d9f78-a5cd-5207-b27f-b675672bb844/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2f3d9f78-a5cd-5207-b27f-b675672bb844/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2f3d9f78-a5cd-5207-b27f-b675672bb844/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2f3d9f78-a5cd-5207-b27f-b675672bb844/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2f3d9f78-a5cd-5207-b27f-b675672bb844/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2f3d9f78-a5cd-5207-b27f-b675672bb844/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2f3d9f78-a5cd-5207-b27f-b675672bb844/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2f3d9f78-a5cd-5207-b27f-b675672bb844/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2f3d9f78-a5cd-5207-b27f-b675672bb844/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2f3d9f78-a5cd-5207-b27f-b675672bb844/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2f3d9f78-a5cd-5207-b27f-b675672bb844/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2f3d9f78-a5cd-5207-b27f-b675672bb844/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"2f499544-ab9a-5d82-a019-54cc764930ce","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/2f499544-ab9a-5d82-a019-54cc764930ce"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"alapaha-blue-blood-bulldog","name":"Alapaha Blue Blood Bulldog","plural-name":"Alapaha Blue Blood Bulldogs","published-at":"2023-09-19T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The exact origins of the Alapaha Bulldog are undocumented. However, dogs resembling this breed have existed in the southern United States since the 1700s. Like the American Bulldog, the Alapaha is believed to be descended from the extinct Old Southern White Bulldog and other English Bulldog derivatives brought to America by the early settlers. The Alapaha gets its name from the Alapaha river in southern Georgia. These dogs primarily served as working dogs tasked with herding cattle and semi-wild hogs, guarding, and other farm duties.\n\nIn the late 1970s, a group of dedicated breeders set out to preserve the dwindling breed. The foundational dogs were derived from a few prominent lines developed by stockmen and women in southern Georgia and Florida, namely the Otto, Silver Dollar, Cowdog and Catahoula Bulldog lines. The breed still goes by the nickname of \"Otto\" for this reason. \n\nToday, Alapahas are bred throughout the United States and abroad.","facts":"The Alapaha Bulldog is an intelligent, alert breed from the working dog group. This American-developed breed is often family-oriented, great with children, and naturally protective.","traits-appearance":"The Alapaha is a medium-to-large dog with a powerful, athletic build and square head.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Alapahas have short, glossy coats that are stiff to the touch. A coat that's white with color patches is preferred. Color patches can be merle, brindle, tri-colored or solid.","traits-physical":"Notable traits of the Alapaha Bulldog include:\n- A medium, square muzzle with a strong underjaw\n- V-shaped ears high and wide on the head, giving a square appearance\n- Muscular neck and body\n- Strong, heavy-boned legs\n- Movement should give impression of power and agility, with no clumsiness","temperament":"Alapahas are devoted, hardworking dogs with protective instincts. These pups typically get along great with children and are loyal family members. They make wonderful watchdogs, though their vigilant nature can make them wary of strangers. Due to their strong prey drive, keeping them on a leash or confined when small animals are around is best.","care-nutrition":"The Alapaha Bulldog does well on high-quality dog food formulated for their age, size, and activity level. To help them maintain a healthy weight, measure their meals to avoid overfeeding and keep treats to 10% or less of their daily calories.","care-grooming":"Alapahas are average shedders. Brush their coats regularly to remove loose fur, especially during seasonal shedding periods. It's important to check their ears regularly and clean them when needed to remove wax build-up and debris. Additionally, nail trims and [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) should be part of their grooming routine.","care-exercise":"These athletic dogs have great stamina and energy. Daily walks, long hikes, and play sessions in a fenced backyard are great ways to keep them physically and mentally fit.","care-training":"Alapahas are intelligent dogs that respond best to consistent training using positive reinforcement techniques. \n\nIn addition to obedience training, this breed will benefit from [early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization). Getting them comfortable with different people and environments when they're young will help them grow into well-adjusted adult dogs.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.alapahabluebloodbulldog.org/history/\n\nhttp://www.iabbr.com/\n\nhttps://www.vetstreet.com/dogs/alapaha-blue-blood-bulldog\n\nhttps://www.ffalapahafarm.com/1e0.html","reviewed-by":"Casey

Lowland Sheepdog","plural-name":"Polish Lowland Sheepdogs","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"In 1514, Polish merchant Kazimierz Grabski traveled to Scotland, where he traded a shipment of grain for sheep. Grabski knew it would be difficult to move the sheep on his own. So, he brought six Polish Lowland Sheepdogs along to help with the task.\n\nImpressed with their herding skills, the Scottish shepherd traded a ram and ewe for three of Grabski’s Polish Lowland Sheepdogs. From there, the breed's popularity quickly grew among shepherds.\n\nThe Polish Lowland Sheepdog, known as Polish Owczarek Nizinny (PON) in Poland, might have descended from a Hungarian herding dog called the [Puli](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/puli).","facts":"The Polish Lowland Sheepdog is a clever and self-confident working breed. With consistent training, these adorable, fluffy dogs make faithful watchdogs and companions.","traits-appearance":"Polish Lowland Sheepdogs are medium-sized, compact, strong dogs with bright, perceptive personalities and a penetrating gaze.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"A soft, dense undercoat and a long, shaggy outer coat comprise the Polish Lowland Sheepdog's double coat. In the show ring, Polish Lowland Sheepdogs must have their natural, unkempt/ungroomed hair.\n\nAll coat colors are acceptable under the breed standard. Some of the most common are black, gray, beige, brown, black and white, chocolate and white, gray and white, and tri-colored. Different coat colors have different textures. For example, Polish Lowland Sheepdogs with black coats have little or no coarse outer coat and less undercoat than dogs of other colors.","traits-physical":"Polish Lowland Sheepdogs are medium-sized, rectangular-shaped dogs. They have level toplines, deep chests, muscular fore- and hindquarters, and full-length or natural bobbed tails.\n\nThe breed's head is in proportion to the body and features heart-shaped, high-set dropped ears and a large black or brown nose. The Polish Lowland Sheepdog's medium-sized, oval brown eyes convey a lively expression and penetrating gaze.","temperament":"Polish Lowland Sheepdogs are energetic, active working dogs that fearlessly defend their flocks. But they have also become popular as pets. At home, these gentle, affectionate dogs make excellent playmates. And Polish Lowland Sheepdogs are generally accepting of other animals. But because of their strong herding instincts, they may attempt to corral and control them.\n\nAccustomed to working solo, Polish Lowland Sheepdogs are comfortable making decisions independent of their owners. This makes them effective in their work. But it can also give them dominating and stubborn tendencies. Fortunately, consistent training can help.\n\nThis adaptable breed will quickly adjust to a range of living conditions—from urban apartment or suburban yard to rural acreage. Regardless of where they live, Polish Lowland Sheepdogs require a lot of exercise to be happy and healthy. And they may be wary of strangers, but this makes them excellent watchdogs.","care-nutrition":"Polish Lowland Sheepdogs need a high-quality dog food formulated for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). To avoid overfeeding, measure out meals, and limit treats to no more than 10% of their daily calories.","care-grooming":"To stay looking their best, Polish Lowland Sheepdogs require a lot of maintenance. The double-coated breed needs thorough grooming every week to remove dead hair and prevent mats and tangles. Some pet parents take their Polish Lowland Sheepdogs to the groomer for a puppy cut. But even dogs with shorter coats require regular brushing and bathing.\n\nTrimming nails, cleaning ears, and [brushing teeth](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) should also be part of every dog's grooming routine, regardless of breed.","care-exercise":"As an active breed, the Polish Lowland Sheepdog needs regular exercise. In addition to brisk walks, these dogs appreciate trips to the park and playing games like fetch in large, fenced areas.\n\nPolish Lowland Sheepdogs also excel at dog sports—such as agility, obedience, dock diving, and herding. To keep this breed happy, opt for activities that provide both mental and physical stimulation, such as hide-and-seek or puzzle toys.","care-training":"Because Polish Lowland Sheepdogs can be stubborn and independent, training is a must. This breed responds best to a consistent training routine that incorporates positive reinforcement and rewards.\n\n[Early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) is important, too. Be sure to introduce your Polish Lowland Sheepdog puppy to new people, pets, and places to help them become a well-mannered, well-adjusted dog.","care-health":null,"references":"http://www.aponc.org/history%20of%20the%20breed.htm\n\nhttp://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/PolishLowlandSheepdog.pdf\n\nhttps://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/polish-lowland-sheepdog/","reviewed-by":"Cindy

of the oldest dog breeds, the Saluki may date back to 7000 B.C. But beyond that, we don't know much about the breed's origins.\n\nWe do know, however, that noblemen and kings throughout history favored the breed. In fact, experts think Egyptian pharaohs and Alexander the Great were Saluki owners.\n\nIn England, organized breeding began in 1895. And within three decades, the Saluki gained its brand standard—as well as recognition from the Kennel Club of England. Today, these sleek, beautiful dogs continue to draw people.","facts":"The beautiful and exotic Saluki has an adoring fan base and mysterious beginnings. Though they may not be the best fit for every household, Salukis can be loving and warm companion pets with the proper training.","traits-appearance":"This sleek breed exudes speed. Salukis' smooth, silky coats have slight feathering on the legs and backs of the thighs. Their silky, hair-covered long ears hang close to the head. And dark hazel eyes suggest the breed is always ready for adventure.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Saluki's coat may be feathered or smooth. The main difference is that the smooth variety has no feathering. This breed comes in cream, white, golden, fawn, red, grizzle and tan, tricolor (tan, black, and white), or tan and black.","traits-physical":"The Saluki is a graceful and agile breed with a streamlined body and smooth, silky hair.","temperament":"The Saluki is a pack animal breed that desires attention and struggles when left alone for long periods. These dogs are gentle and loving. But they require socialization and training because they're also independent and strong-willed. You should always supervise your Saluki when they're around small kids.\n\nAn active breed, the Saluki requires plenty of space to run and exercise. But because of their strong instinct to hunt, Salukis should never be allowed off-leash when outside unless they are in a very secure area.","care-nutrition":"Salukis thrive on an age-appropriate, high-quality diet. It's important to monitor how much your Saluki eats since some dogs are prone to gaining excess weight as they age. If this happens to your pup, consider cutting back on portions (or treats). Appetites vary among Salukis. So, check with your veterinarian if you're worried about how much your dog is eating.","care-grooming":"Whether feathered or smooth, the Saluki coat is easy to groom. A weekly brushing should keep it looking healthy and shiny. Feathering along the ears or tail might require more frequent care to prevent matting and remove dirt. A device called a \"snood\" may also help keep ear feathering away from food bowls.\n\nTrimming nails, cleaning ears, and [brushing teeth](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) should also be part of every dog's grooming routine, regardless of breed.","care-exercise":"The Saluki is an energetic, active breed that requires daily exercise to stay healthy.

Wheeler assumed the hair type resulted from a recessive gene, and the American Kennel Club (AKC) registered these dogs as long-haired Whippets. But the American Whippet Club later determined a recessive gene wasn't to blame. More likely, the long hair resulted from crossing Whippets with [Shetland Sheepdogs](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/shetland-sheepdog).\n\nThe AKC removed the breed from their studbook and currently considers the dogs to be a mixed breed. However, kennel clubs in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary recognize them as Windsprites.\n\nSilken Windhounds came about in the 1980s when Frances Stull began breeding [Borzois](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/borzoi) with Windsprites and Whippets. The United Kennel Club recognized this new breed in 2011.","facts":"Silken Windhounds and Windsprites are graceful, intelligent dogs.

The hair is longer on the neck, and there is feathering on the chest, legs, and tail. These pups come in all colors and coat patterns.","traits-physical":"Notable traits of these breeds include a long, lean head, slim waist, muscular back legs, and a long, tapered tail.","temperament":"Silken Windhounds and Windsprites are friendly, affectionate dogs that make excellent family pets. They form tight bonds with their humans and are gentle and playful with children.\n\nThough they need opportunities to run and explore, they're more than happy to relax in the house (preferably on a comfy couch) once they burn off energy. Both breeds have a strong prey drive. So, it's best to keep them in enclosed spaces. Otherwise, small animals might tempt these speedy hunters.","care-nutrition":"These breeds thrive on a high-quality diet formulated for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). To help your dog maintain their slender physique, measure portions to avoid overfeeding and keep an eye on how many treats you're giving. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of a dog's daily calories.\n\nBoth Windsprites and Silken Windhounds have deep chests that may make them more prone to bloat (also known as twisted stomach). To minimize the risk of bloat, break their food up into several meals a day, and use a food bowl designed to slow their eating. Also, avoid feeding immediately before or after vigorous activity. These are just a few ways you can help prevent this life-threatening condition. Consult your veterinarian about other methods, including surgical options.","care-grooming":"To maintain these dogs' silky coats, brush them a few times a week and bathe them every couple of months.

They enjoy spending time with their people and often get along well with other dogs. But they may be wary of strangers.\n\nThough their protective nature makes them good guard dogs, Pungsans should be properly trained and socialized for the safety of all.

To keep loose fur under control, brush your dog a couple of times a week. When they blow their coats (twice a year), more frequent grooming sessions can help keep tufts of fluff from decorating your floor.\n\nTo reduce your pup's chance of ear infections, check their ears regularly and clean them as needed to remove wax build-up and debris. Nail trims should also be part of every dog's grooming routine since overly long nails can cause pain or even lead to problems running or walking.\n\nLastly, good [dental hygiene](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) will support your dog's overall health.

If they can't release pent-up energy, they may turn to digging, chewing, or other destructive behaviors.\n\nFun activities for this breed include long walks, hikes, and games. A fenced backyard will give your pup space to run around while also preventing them from chasing after unsuspecting critters.","care-training":"[Early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) and obedience training are essential for this breed.

Once considered an ancient breed, Beardies may have actually descended from Central European breeds—such as the [Komondor](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/komondor) and [Polish Lowland Sheepdogs](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/polish-lowland-sheepdog)—that arrived in Scotland in the 1500s.\n\nKnown to spend long hours working cattle in the pasture and driving them to market, these herding and droving dogs have a strong work ethic. As a result, Bearded Collies were particularly popular among farming families throughout history. But upper classes also owned the breed. In fact, Reynolds, Gainsborough, and other artists featured Bearded Collies in portraits of their well-to-do clients.\n\nThe population of Bearded Collies fell after World War I. Fortunately, devoted British breeders have since helped restore their numbers. Despite the Beardie's prevalence and popularity in Europe, the United States did not record its first litter of the breed until 1967.","facts":"Independent, strong, and agile, the Bearded Collie is an active working breed. But these long-haired dogs are also softies with their families and love playing with other pets and children.","traits-appearance":"Medium-sized dogs, Bearded Collies have long, lean bodies, medium-length coats, and bright, enquiring expressions.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Bearded Collie has a double coat. The undercoat is soft, furry, and close, whereas the outer coat is flat, harsh, strong, shaggy, and free from wooliness and curl. Beardies' coats part and fall to either side of their bodies, but they should not be artificially parted.\n\nThe Bearded Collie's name comes from the longer, beard-like hair on the cheeks, lower lips, and chin. In competitions, these dogs must be shown naturally—no trimming of their coats is allowed.\n\nBearded Collies come in four colors: black, blue, brown, or fawn with or without white markings. The breed standard allows tan markings below the base of the tail, on the eyebrows, cheeks, or legs (where white joins the main color), or inside the ears. Puppies are often darker, and their coats may lighten as they mature into adulthood.","traits-physical":"Bearded Collies are long and lean with level backs, deep chests, well-sprung ribs, and powerful, muscular hindquarters. The breed also has a strong, full muzzle and medium-sized, hair-covered ears that hang down.\n\nThe Beardie's large, wide-set eyes have an expressive, soft, and affectionate gaze with pigmentation corresponding to the coat colors. (Black Bearded Collies have black eye rims, noses, and lips. Blue Bearded Collies have pigmentation in a blue-grey color. And so on.)","temperament":"Bearded Collies were bred to work and appreciate having jobs to do. These outgoing, active dogs willingly lead the way on hikes, runs, and other fast-paced outings.\n\nBeardies also typically get along with other pets and children. But because of their strong herding tendencies, they may try to corral kids or herd other animals.","care-nutrition":"Bearded Collies require a high-quality, age-appropriate (e.g., puppy, adult, senior) diet. Dog foods formulated for active breeds are a good option.\n\nLike all dogs, Bearded Collies can become overweight if allowed to eat as much as they want. Measuring out your dog's meals and limiting treats to no more than 10% of their daily calories can help keep your Beardie fit and trim.","care-grooming":"It takes effort to keep the Bearded Collie's coat at its best. Daily brushing helps remove any dirt and debris that these dogs might have picked up outdoors and prevents painful mats from forming. A weekly session with a pin rake and some detangling spray helps remove dead hair and leaves a Beardie's coat looking pristine.\n\nTrimming nails, cleaning ears, and [brushing teeth](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) should also be part of every dog's grooming routine, regardless of breed.","care-exercise":"Bearded Collies love to be on the move and enjoy regular walks, hikes, trips to the dog park, and games in the backyard. Natural athletic prowess means the Bearded Collie also excels at dog sports—including rally, agility, competitive obedience, and herding.\n\nMental stimulation is important, too. Puzzle toys and games like hide-and-seek can keep your pup's mind engaged.","care-training":"Bearded Collies love spending time with their owners. And that means yours will likely see training as a bonding experience. Beardies benefit from a consistent (but varied) training routine. These intelligent dogs get bored easily.

Today, the Mountain Cat group inhabits regions in North, Central, and South America, as well as Europe, Africa, and Asia. Though many of these cats reside in mountainous areas, some—like the Cheetah—can thrive at all elevations.\n\nIberian Lynx are the world's most endangered feline species, with a population of just over 400.

The Croats who settled the land brought their dogs, believed to be descendants of the Pfahlbauhund, to herd cattle and sheep in the plains of Slavonia. The Croatian Shepherd, also known as the Croatian Sheepdog, spread across Croatia and then throughout the rest of Europe.\n\nIn 1935, a Croatian professor began the first systematic breeding program for the Croatian Shepherd. It took more than three decades for a breed standard to be published.","facts":"The Croatian Shepherd is a tireless herding dog that is active, agile, courageous, and has a boundless enthusiasm for work.","traits-appearance":"The Croatian Shepherd is a medium-sized, compact, Spitz-type dog with a rustic appearance.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Croatian Shepherds have dense, compact, and soft undercoats their topcoats are profuse, dense, and soft with stand-off wavy to curly hair that can grow up to five-and-a-half inches long. Their hair is longer on the neck, back, croup, ribs, backs of the forearms and hindlegs with the longest part of their coats at the culottes near the root of their tails. It is shorter on their foreheads, on the muzzle, forehead, ears, around the eyes, on the cheeks, and on the front part of the forelegs. Males have longer, more profuse coats than females.\n\nCroatian Shepherds are black. A few (almost invisible) white hairs spread across their bodies and white markings on the chest are permitted. Their undercoats are black except during shedding season when the color might turn greyish or have a slightly brown tinge; neither is a fault.","traits-physical":"Croatian Shepherds have rectangular-shaped bodies with horizontal, muscular backs; short, well-muscled loins; deep, broad chests; and tails that are strong at the root, tapered toward the tip, and carried above the topline when the dogs are alert. These dogs also have oval eyes; triangular ears with rounded tips that are carried either pricked or semi-pricked; and tapered muzzles; their facial features give Croatian Shepherds a fox-like expression.","temperament":"While Croatian Shepherds exhibit traits such as alertness, intelligence, courage, and endurance that make them excellent working dogs, the breed is also patient and levelheaded, which are qualities that have endeared it to families as a loyal companion. The breed is known for being devoted to its owners and should be invited to participate in activities; left on their own, Croatian Shepherds could become unhappy and destructive.\n\nCroatian Shepherds are bundles of energy and love participating in outdoor activities but are also calm and relaxed in the house. A yard with a tall fence is a must as Croatian Shepherds are excellent jumpers and can easily scale a fence in search of adventure (and mischief).\n\nTheir working dog tendencies remain strong, making Croatian Shepherds excellent watchdogs.","care-nutrition":"Feed Croatian Shepherds a high quality dog food that is appropriate for their life stage (puppy, adult, senior) and consider a diet formulated for active breeds. To keep Croatian Shepherds fit and trim, portion out their food with a measuring cup and limiting treats to no more than 10 percent of their daily calories.","care-grooming":"Croatian Shepherds have low maintenance coats. An occasional bath and brushing to remove dead hair are all it takes to keep this breed looking its best.\n\nCroatian Shepherds also require regular ear cleanings, nail trims, and a [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) routine that includes at-home teeth brushing and professional cleanings. Start these grooming essentials when Croatian Shepherds are puppies to ensure they are part of a regular routine.","care-exercise":"Croatian Shepherds might be calm and relaxed in the house but that doesn’t mean they are couch potatoes. The highly energetic breed enjoys running, hiking, swimming, and trips to the dog park. Croatian Shepherds are also notorious diggers and appreciate a spot to engage in the behavior without getting in trouble. Croatian Shepherds also excel in dog sports such as agility, obedience, rally, dock diving, and herding. Plenty of exercise and mental stimulation are the key to ensuring Croatian Shepherds are tired and will not go looking for trouble.","care-training":"Croatian Shepherds are smart, energetic, and eager to please, which makes them easy to train. Use positive reinforcement and rewards to help Croatian Shepherds master basic commands and learn new skills. Keeping activities fast paced and avoiding repetition will help keep these intelligent dogs interested in training.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/croatian-sheepdog/\n\nhttp://www.fci.be/Nomenclature/Standards/277g01-en.pdf","reviewed-by":"Annette Louviere, DVM","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":13.2,"weight-range-pet-max":19.5,"weight-range-show-min":13.2,"weight-range-show-max":19.5,"height-range-min":41.0,"height-range-max":53.0,"life-span-range-min":13.0,"life-span-range-max":14.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":97,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":57,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":41},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/320af560-5802-5fff-ab99-6c18e04efda9/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/320af560-5802-5fff-ab99-6c18e04efda9/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/320af560-5802-5fff-ab99-6c18e04efda9/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/320af560-5802-5fff-ab99-6c18e04efda9/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/320af560-5802-5fff-ab99-6c18e04efda9/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/320af560-5802-5fff-ab99-6c18e04efda9/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/320af560-5802-5fff-ab99-6c18e04efda9/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/320af560-5802-5fff-ab99-6c18e04efda9/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/320af560-5802-5fff-ab99-6c18e04efda9/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/320af560-5802-5fff-ab99-6c18e04efda9/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/320af560-5802-5fff-ab99-6c18e04efda9/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/320af560-5802-5fff-ab99-6c18e04efda9/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/320af560-5802-5fff-ab99-6c18e04efda9/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/320af560-5802-5fff-ab99-6c18e04efda9/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/320af560-5802-5fff-ab99-6c18e04efda9/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/320af560-5802-5fff-ab99-6c18e04efda9/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/320af560-5802-5fff-ab99-6c18e04efda9/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/320af560-5802-5fff-ab99-6c18e04efda9/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"322d1223-19e1-5a6e-a178-46f96a90f5a9","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/322d1223-19e1-5a6e-a178-46f96a90f5a9"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"schapendoes","name":"Schapendoes","plural-name":"Schapendoezen","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The breed, also known as Nederlandse Schapendoes, became a favorite of Dutch shepherds thanks to its speed and endurance.

Even in their home country, the Border Collie often overshadowed the native breed, and their numbers dwindled.\n\nLike other European herding dogs, the Schapendoes almost disappeared during World War II. However, P.M.C. Toepoel, a founder of the breed, helped restore flagging populations. A national breed club formed in 1954 and created a breed standard for the Schapendoes.\n\nThe number of registered dogs has since increased but remains small to this day.","facts":"The “shaggy sheepdog of Holland” is a friendly, affectionate, cheery dog that excels as a pet for active families looking for a spirited companion.","traits-appearance":"Schapendoes are medium-sized dogs with long coats, effortless movements, and open-minded expressions.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"These double-coated dogs have sufficient undercoats and long, slightly wavy overcoats with fine, dry hair.\n\nOn the hindquarters, their coats can be two-and-a-half inches long (or longer) and stand in tufts, giving Schapendoes the appearance of a large girth. Schapendoes also have large top knots, mustaches, and beards.\n\nThe breed standard permits all colors, but it prefers for Schapendoes with blue-grey to black coloring.","traits-physical":"Schapendoes have fine-boned bodies that are slightly more long than tall. These dogs have deep chests, muscular hocks, and strong necks. Their large, broad feet with tightly bunched toes and thick, springy pads allow Schapendoes to move with a light-footed gallop.\n\nSchapendoes also have high-set ears that hang free and large, round eyes with a lively, honest expression.","temperament":"Schapendoes are herding dogs that moved flocks between pastures. The job required attentiveness and courage—traits that remain hallmarks of the breed; these are also characteristics that make Schapendoes excellent watchdogs.\n\nWith their families, Schapendoes are outgoing, high spirited, and friendly. They develop a strong sense of loyalty to their human packs and enjoy spending time together, especially outdoor activities.\n\nBut remember, these are herding dogs so they may attempt to corral children or other pets.","care-nutrition":"Feed Schapendoes a high-quality dog food that is appropriate for their life stage (puppy, adult, senior). Portion out their food with a measuring cup and limit treats to no more than 10 percent of their daily calories to avoid overfeeding.","care-grooming":"Although the Schapendoes has long hair, their grooming needs are minimal. An occasional bath and weekly brushing are all it takes to keep their hair free of mats, tangles, and debris.\n\nSchapendoes also benefit from a regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) routine that includes at-home teeth brushing and professional cleanings.","care-exercise":"The Schapendoes is an active breed that relied on endurance and speed to herd their flocks; thus, they need regular exercise to be healthy, happy pets.\n\nIn addition to regular walks, swimming, hiking, and trips to the dog park, Schapendoes also do well in dog sports such as obedience, agility, and rally. Games of fetch in a fenced yard can also help Schapendoes burn off some of their abundant energy.\n\nSchapendoes are extraordinary jumpers and could easily clear a fence, so it's essential to supervise them during outdoor activities.","care-training":"Schapendoes are both intelligent and independent, which means they're quick learners but may need some incentive to stick with their training. Keep training sessions short and upbeat and use motivational tools such as treats and favorite toys to help Schapendoes master basic commands and learn new tricks.\n\n[Socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) is important for all breeds, including Schapendoes. Start early, exposing these dogs to new people, pets, and places to help them mature into well-adjusted pets.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/schapendoes/\n\nhttp://www.fci.be/Nomenclature/Standards/313g01-en.pdf\n\nhttp://schapendoesclub.ca/health/introduction-2/","reviewed-by":"Cindy Elston, DVM, MPH","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":11.8,"weight-range-pet-max":24.9,"weight-range-show-min":11.8,"weight-range-show-max":24.9,"height-range-min":41.0,"height-range-max":51.0,"life-span-range-min":12.0,"life-span-range-max":15.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":97,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":57,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":41},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/322d1223-19e1-5a6e-a178-46f96a90f5a9/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/322d1223-19e1-5a6e-a178-46f96a90f5a9/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/322d1223-19e1-5a6e-a178-46f96a90f5a9/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/322d1223-19e1-5a6e-a178-46f96a90f5a9/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/322d1223-19e1-5a6e-a178-46f96a90f5a9/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/322d1223-19e1-5a6e-a178-46f96a90f5a9/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/322d1223-19e1-5a6e-a178-46f96a90f5a9/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/322d1223-19e1-5a6e-a178-46f96a90f5a9/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/322d1223-19e1-5a6e-a178-46f96a90f5a9/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/322d1223-19e1-5a6e-a178-46f96a90f5a9/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/322d1223-19e1-5a6e-a178-46f96a90f5a9/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/322d1223-19e1-5a6e-a178-46f96a90f5a9/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/322d1223-19e1-5a6e-a178-46f96a90f5a9/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/322d1223-19e1-5a6e-a178-46f96a90f5a9/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/322d1223-19e1-5a6e-a178-46f96a90f5a9/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/322d1223-19e1-5a6e-a178-46f96a90f5a9/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/322d1223-19e1-5a6e-a178-46f96a90f5a9/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/322d1223-19e1-5a6e-a178-46f96a90f5a9/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"3260bad5-ee02-5391-ade9-10ec30f9f4d6","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3260bad5-ee02-5391-ade9-10ec30f9f4d6"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"chinese-crested","name":"Chinese Crested","plural-name":"Chinese Cresteds","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"Experts debate the origin of these energetic dogs. Most agree that the Chinese Crested is a long-established breed, dating back to 16th-century China. But while some insist that the breed shares a common ancestry with the Mexican Hairless dogs, others believe it originated in Africa.\n\nThough the origins of the Chinese Crested may be questionable, the breed's popularity is not. Famous entertainers like Gypsy Rose Lee and her sister, actress June Havoc, have owned and promoted the breed.\n\nThe Chinese Crested received official American Kennel Club recognition in 1991.","facts":"The Chinese Crested is a sweet, devoted, and affectionate dog. Cresteds do well in apartments and other small-space dwellings thanks to their petite size. And their unusual appearance often earns the attention of strangers on walks.","traits-appearance":"The Chinese Crested makes for a small companion with a graceful and elegant look. These dogs have pointed muzzles and Poodle-like faces.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Chinese Crested comes in two varieties: powderpuff (i.e., soft, straight coat) and hairless (i.e., silky hair on the head, tail, and feet). The breed may be a wide range of colors—including apricot, black, chocolate, white, silver, pink, and red. Cresteds may also have white or palomino markings.","traits-physical":"A delicate bone structure and fluid movements distinguish both varieties of the Chinese Crested. They have slightly rounded but lengthy heads, carved cheeks, and long, narrow, close-toed feet.","temperament":"The Chinese Crested is a feisty, attentive breed with a warm personality. These dogs are incredibly loyal to their people and excellent with children. Still, small kids must be supervised in the company of any dog (for mutual safety). This breed is usually friendly toward other pets, too.\n\nThough Cresteds generally don't bark much, they do love digging. They also crave attention and cuddling, so it's best not to leave Chinese Cresteds alone for long periods.","care-nutrition":"The Chinese Crested needs a high-quality pet food that is age-appropriate and formulated for small or toy breeds.\n\nGiven that this breed is prone to obesity, it's important to monitor the amount of food you give your Chinese Crested. Reduce portions or restrict calories if your pup gains weight. Also, remember that giving too many treats in addition to regular meals can contribute to obesity and other health issues.","care-grooming":"The Chinese Crested's skin is prone to irritations, allergies, and even sunburn. So, gentle grooming—using skin products specifically designed for the breed—is necessary.\n\nDaily brushing will keep the powderpuff Chinese Crested's coat fluffy. But understand that the breed's coat is not like that of most other dogs. The undercoat is shorter than the overlay, which is the opposite of most breeds with hair. On the upside, this trait makes brushing easier. On the downside, the coat mats quickly.","care-exercise":"You can satisfy the Chinese Crested's need for physical activity with daily short walks and playtime in the backyard. Outdoor exercise is good for this breed, but remember that the hairless variety has exposed skin. So, either apply sunscreen or dress your dog in protective clothing. If you use sunscreen, be mindful of ingredients, and observe your Chinese Crested for allergic reactions.\n\nCresteds excel in dog sports such as agility, flyball, and obedience training—all of which provide physical and mental stimulation. These resilient little dogs enjoy challenges and can be very competitive in canine sports.","care-training":"Though Chinese Cresteds are highly intelligent, they require gentle handling, positive reinforcement, and patience when training. Use treats as a steady motivator, and your dog will cooperate with the lesson.\n\n[Early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) and puppy training will reduce timid or aggressive behavior. As a result, your Chinese Crested will be more comfortable around strangers and other animals.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/chinese-crested/","reviewed-by":"Annette Louviere, DVM","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":3.2,"weight-range-pet-max":7.3,"weight-range-show-min":3.6,"weight-range-show-max":5.4,"height-range-min":23.0,"height-range-max":33.0,"life-span-range-min":13.0,"life-span-range-max":18.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":71,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":44,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":36},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3260bad5-ee02-5391-ade9-10ec30f9f4d6/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3260bad5-ee02-5391-ade9-10ec30f9f4d6/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3260bad5-ee02-5391-ade9-10ec30f9f4d6/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3260bad5-ee02-5391-ade9-10ec30f9f4d6/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3260bad5-ee02-5391-ade9-10ec30f9f4d6/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3260bad5-ee02-5391-ade9-10ec30f9f4d6/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3260bad5-ee02-5391-ade9-10ec30f9f4d6/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3260bad5-ee02-5391-ade9-10ec30f9f4d6/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3260bad5-ee02-5391-ade9-10ec30f9f4d6/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3260bad5-ee02-5391-ade9-10ec30f9f4d6/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3260bad5-ee02-5391-ade9-10ec30f9f4d6/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3260bad5-ee02-5391-ade9-10ec30f9f4d6/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3260bad5-ee02-5391-ade9-10ec30f9f4d6/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3260bad5-ee02-5391-ade9-10ec30f9f4d6/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3260bad5-ee02-5391-ade9-10ec30f9f4d6/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3260bad5-ee02-5391-ade9-10ec30f9f4d6/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3260bad5-ee02-5391-ade9-10ec30f9f4d6/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3260bad5-ee02-5391-ade9-10ec30f9f4d6/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"3289a122-e3af-574c-ae4c-fcea2b4735cc","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3289a122-e3af-574c-ae4c-fcea2b4735cc"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"american-staffordshire-terrier","name":"American Staffordshire Terrier","plural-name":"American Staffordshire Terrier","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The American Staffordshire Terrier (or AmStaff, for short) dates back to 19th-century England—when various terriers were crossed with the [Bulldog](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/bulldog-standard). The courageous and powerful dogs that resulted excelled in the fighting pit. But they also showed great talent as guard dogs and livestock herders.\n\nThese pit bulls came to America in the late 1800s. And though some were used for fighting, many became fixtures both on the frontier and at home—thanks to their hard-working, gentle nature. Still, most kennel clubs were hesitant to recognize dogs associated with fighting.\n\nThough the American Pit Bull Terrier received United Kennel Club recognition at the turn of the century, breeders in the U.S. set out to develop a related but distinct breed. They focused their breeding programs on increasing the pit bull's size and weight.\n\nThis effort led to the Staffordshire Terrier, which the AKC recognized in 1936. When the AKC later recognized the Staffordshire Bull Terrier from England in 1972, they decided to add “American” to the Staffordshire Terrier’s name to clearly delineate between the two breeds.\n\nToday, most AmStaffs live as peaceful, gentle family members. They've earned a great reputation and excel in many roles—including guarding, police work, and agility.","facts":"Though known as a courageous and powerful breed, the American Staffordshire Terrier is also affectionate and loyal. Loving toward family members and excellent with children, these pups make calm, fun-loving household companions when responsibly bred and properly cared for.","traits-appearance":"American Staffordshire Terriers are sturdy, agile, and highly aware of their surroundings. The breed exudes strength with a muscular body, broad skull, and powerful jaw.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The AmStaff's coat is short, shiny, and stiff to the touch. This breed can be any color with solid, parti-color, or patched black, brown, tan, brindle (black and brown striped), liver, red, or fawn. Black or blue mask and brindle are common in American Staffordshire Terriers. Dogs that are all white, more than 80% white, black and tan, and liver are not encouraged in the breed standard.","traits-physical":"American Staffordshire Terriers are known for their well-defined, strong jaws. Their eyes are round, set far apart on the face, and typically dark. And their uncropped ears are short and held half prick or rose (an ear shape that resembles the petals of a rose).\n\nAmStaffs have a stocky build and are heavy for their size. They have relatively short, low-set tails that taper to a point.","temperament":"American Staffordshire Terriers are very loyal to their families and usually good with children.\n\nKnown as intelligent, hard-working, and stoic, AmStaffs make excellent guard dogs. Though they're good-natured, they may be protective of their families. That said, they're not aggressive unless provoked.\n\nAmerican Staffordshire Terriers can be suspicious of people they don't know. And they may not get along well with unfamiliar dogs or small pets. [Early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) and training can help them be friendly toward other animals and strangers.","care-nutrition":"American Staffordshire Terriers thrive on a high-quality diet that's appropriate for their life stage. Feeding a large-breed puppy formula can help keep your AmStaff pup from growing too fast and developing painful hip dysplasia later in life.\n\nTake care to monitor how much your dog eats and reduce portions if they gain too much weight. And remember to count calories from treats. As a general rule, they should make up no more than 10% of a dog's caloric intake.","care-grooming":"The American Staffordshire Terrier's short coat and light shedding make it a very low-maintenance breed in terms of grooming. Weekly brushing with a soft-bristled brush and an occasional bath is usually all these dogs need.\n\nKeep in mind that all pups require regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care)—including at-home teeth brushing and professional dental cleanings.","care-exercise":"American Staffordshire Terriers need daily exercise, whether that's a leashed walk, short run, or backyard game of fetch. But when exercising your AmStaff outdoors in the winter, be sure to keep your sessions relatively brief. Their short coats are not suited for chilly weather. (That said, fashionable sweaters can help!)\n\nStrong and athletic, AmStaffs also seem to enjoy dog sports—such as agility, flyball, and rally. Competitive [obedience training](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-obedience-training) is another great option that not only reinforces desired behaviors but also provides your dog with mental exercise.","care-training":"Obedient and relatively easy to train, AmStaff Terriers benefit from firm, dedicated training to temper their guarding tendencies. But remember: They can be stubborn and may not respond well to forceful training methods. So, positive, reward-based training is the best way to help this intelligent breed learn quickly.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.rover.com/blog/american-staffordshire-terrier-fun-facts-and-myths-vs-reality/\n\nhttps://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/american-staffordshire-terrier/\n\nhttps://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/dog-breeds/american-staffordshire-terrier\n\nhttp://www.fci.be/Nomenclature/Standards/286g03-en.pdf\n\nhttps://www.akc.org/expert-advice/dog-breeds/american-staffordshire-terrier-history-amstaff/","reviewed-by":"Cindy Elston, DVM, MPH","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":17.2,"weight-range-pet-max":30.8,"weight-range-show-min":18.1,"weight-range-show-max":27.2,"height-range-min":43.0,"height-range-max":48.0,"life-span-range-min":12.0,"life-span-range-max":16.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":92,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":55,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":37},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3289a122-e3af-574c-ae4c-fcea2b4735cc/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3289a122-e3af-574c-ae4c-fcea2b4735cc/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3289a122-e3af-574c-ae4c-fcea2b4735cc/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3289a122-e3af-574c-ae4c-fcea2b4735cc/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3289a122-e3af-574c-ae4c-fcea2b4735cc/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3289a122-e3af-574c-ae4c-fcea2b4735cc/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3289a122-e3af-574c-ae4c-fcea2b4735cc/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3289a122-e3af-574c-ae4c-fcea2b4735cc/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3289a122-e3af-574c-ae4c-fcea2b4735cc/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3289a122-e3af-574c-ae4c-fcea2b4735cc/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3289a122-e3af-574c-ae4c-fcea2b4735cc/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3289a122-e3af-574c-ae4c-fcea2b4735cc/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3289a122-e3af-574c-ae4c-fcea2b4735cc/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3289a122-e3af-574c-ae4c-fcea2b4735cc/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3289a122-e3af-574c-ae4c-fcea2b4735cc/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3289a122-e3af-574c-ae4c-fcea2b4735cc/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3289a122-e3af-574c-ae4c-fcea2b4735cc/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3289a122-e3af-574c-ae4c-fcea2b4735cc/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"328f3d1c-9828-58cf-ac4e-2a0703eff9ce","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/328f3d1c-9828-58cf-ac4e-2a0703eff9ce"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"selkirk-rex","name":"Selkirk Rex","plural-name":null,"published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"cat","history":"The Selkirk Rex originated in Montana in 1987 when a stray cat gave birth to a kitten with an unusual wavy coat. A Persian breeder named Jeri Newman adopted the kitten and called her Miss DePesto.\n\nAfter a little investigating, Jeri concluded that there were no other curly cats in the area. Suspecting Miss Depesto had a new rex mutation—a genetic variation that results in curly hair—Jeri decided to breed her with one of her Persian males. The resulting litter had six kittens. Three of them had normal coats, and three had curly coats, proving that the rex gene was dominant.\n\nBreeders worked to develop a standard for these curly-coated cats, and in 1990 TICA accepted the Selkirk Rex into their new breed program. Four years later, they granted it Championship status.","facts":"The Selkirk Rex is a curly-coated cutie with a mellow personality and loving nature.

Known for their patience and tolerance, they're an excellent fit for homes with other pets or kids.\n\nThis breed has a playful nature but isn't overly energetic or hyper.\n\nSelkirks like to keep themselves entertained by stalking their toys and interacting with food puzzles.\n\nAnd if you feel an urge to cuddle with these teddy bear lookalikes, good news: Selkirks like to hang out in their human's lap or snuggle under the covers in bed.","care-nutrition":"The Selkirk Rex requires a high-quality diet. Because nutritional needs vary for kittens, adults, and senior cats, opt for a formula that's age-appropriate for your pet.\n\nObesity is on the rise in cats. Since extra pounds can contribute to other serious health issues, it's important to watch your cat's weight. Avoid overfeeding by measuring out meals and reducing portions if necessary. And be sure to account for treats. As a guideline, they should make up no more than 10% of a cat's calories.\n\nLastly, all cats need access to fresh, clean water around the clock.","care-grooming":"Regardless of coat length, Selkirks need to be brushed once a week with a wide-toothed comb to help keep their curls intact. These cats don't typically require frequent baths. But when you do bathe them, blot them dry with a towel instead of blow-drying. As any human with curly hair can attest, hairdryers contribute to frizziness.\n\nEar cleaning and nail trims should also be part of your cat's grooming routine. Check their ears monthly to clear out wax buildup or debris. And trim their nails every few weeks to keep them at an appropriate length. Long nails are more likely to snag on something and become torn or damaged. They can even grow into your cat's paw pads, leading to pain or infection. In addition to clipping, providing a scratching post will allow your cat to do some nail maintenance themselves (thanks to their instinct to scratch).\n\nAnd don't forget about those teeth. Dental care is essential to a Selkirk Rex's lifelong health. Starting in kittenhood, get your cat comfortable with at-home teeth brushing and professional exams and cleanings.","care-exercise":null,"care-training":null,"care-health":"Some breeds are more susceptible to certain health conditions. Selkirks may be prone to developing Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy—which decreases the heart's efficiency and can lead to other issues.

They were a common part of human culture before writing and record keeping became prolific. There are depictions of them spread across ancient Europe and the Middle East. Evidence has been found they existed in Turkey during 6000 BC, in Egypt around 1350 BC, and in Greece in 500 BC.\n\nThey were officially documented in the UK in 1210. The documentation indicates they were regularly used by nobility in large hunting packs, used to hunt almost all of the available quarry in England including hare, fox, boar, bear, deer, and stags. The breed standard was introduced in 1370, which is also when hare coursing started to become a popular sport. Hare coursing was sanctioned as an official sport in 1650 by Queen Elizabeth, this meant there was always a need for Greyhounds to be bred and refined.\n\nIt was these hare coursing Greyhounds from the UK that make up the ancestry of all Greyhounds in North America. The AKC recognized the Greyhound in 1885, included in their 2","facts":"The mold for all coursing hounds, the Greyhound has been a part of human culture for at least 8,000 years. They are the very picture of speed and grace. Greyhounds own the title as the fastest dog, which is easy to understand given their powerful, aerodynamic build.","traits-appearance":"The Greyhound’s lithe frame, deep chest, and slim waist create an elegant inverted S that is instantly recognizable. They are the template that has forged the many variations of sighthounds throughout history","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Smooth and soft to the touch, the Greyhounds’ short coat can come in almost any color. It is one of the few dogs whose color is immaterial when being judged at a dog show.","traits-physical":"A sleek, muscular dog that is the very definition of a sighthound. Their tall frames are both powerful and agile. Absolutely built for speed, Greyhounds exude their ability to run faster than any other dog.","temperament":"The Greyhound is a supreme athlete with a dignified and sweet temperament. Used by nobility for hunting and entertainment throughout history, they make wonderful companions.\n\nGreyhounds are a gentle, sweet, and devoted dog. They have quiet grace and nobility about them and don’t love to be flashy or the center of attention. They understand their speedy potential and need to be exercised often. Greyhound’s have developed such a keen sense for the chase that it is impossible to call their attention back when they see something cross their path. This means it is vital they stay on a leash in any open space.","care-nutrition":"Like their athletic nature indicates, they may require a higher caloric and protein rich diet to maintain their health. This is provided they are getting the exercise necessary to burn off any extra food.\n\nGreyhounds require a high-quality dog food that is age-appropriate—whether it’s commercially manufactured or homemade (with a veterinarian’s supervision and approval). It’s important to monitor the amount of food you give your Greyhound. Reduce the portions or restrict calories if your pup gains weight.\n\nAs with any dog, it’s important to monitor the amount of food and treats that you give your Greyhound, especially since some dogs may be prone to gaining weight as they age. Your veterinarian is always a good source to help provide you with appropriate nutrition and feeding guidelines.","care-grooming":"The Greyhound requires moderate grooming maintenance, including brushing their teeth daily if possible. With adequate exercise, their rapidly growing nails should stay worn down, but they need to be inspected regularly as the overgrown nails can cause discomfort. A weekly brushing, as well as a recurring bath, is all that is needed to keep their short coat in good condition.\n\nAll dogs require regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care), including at-home teeth brushing and professional dental cleanings, and Greyhound is no exception. Maintaining good dental hygiene is important for their overall long-term health.","care-exercise":"Greyhounds need to be able to unleash their incredible speed and love doing so by chasing after a ball or coursing lure. To remain in top form, these dogs require daily, vigorous exercise. As with all athletes, once spent, they enjoy nothing more than plopping down on the couch and relaxing next to their beloved humans.","care-training":"Greyhounds are a sensitive and affectionate dog that doesn’t do well with harsh training methods. They adore their family but are reserved around strangers. Greyhounds should be socialized with young children and small animals as a puppy. Keep them on a leash at all times when not in an enclosed area, as they cannot restrain their desire to take chase should the opportunity present itself.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/greyhound/\n\nhttps://www.greyhoundclubofamericainc.org/greyhound-type/\n\nhttp://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/Greyhound.pdf\n\nhttp://www.greyhoundclubofamericainc.org/wp-content/uploads/Greyhound-_Study_Guide_FINAL_EDITION.pdf","reviewed-by":"Cindy

large Molosser breed from Denmark, the Broholmer was the result of crossbreeding English Mastiffs with local German dogs. The breed's numbers fell sharply during World War II. But since the 1970s, Broholmer populations have been steadily rising.\n\nAs with many of the Molosser breeds, the Broholmer's intended job was to guard homes of the wealthy. In present-day, however, these big pups more often serve as gentle companion dogs. That said, Broholmers still possess protective tendencies.","facts":"The Broholmer is a large dog with a resounding bark and confident walk. Intelligent, alert, and loyal, Broholmers love cuddling with their people. These mighty pups tend to be good with children and other dogs, making them great family companions.","traits-appearance":"Broholmers have solidly built, rectangular bodies that move in a composed yet powerful way.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Broholmer's short, dense coat is generally light-yellow, brownish-yellow, or black.","traits-physical":"A big, broad head and short drop ears are stand-out features of the Broholmer.","temperament":"Broholmers are calm, docile, and even-tempered. They may be wary of strangers, but they're loyal and affectionate to their family. Keep in mind, however, that Broholmers are best for families with older children who know how to approach and play with large dogs.\n\nDespite their large size, Broholmers often act as though they think they are lap dogs. They love to be around—or even on—members of their human pack.\n\nAs a big breed, the Broholmer requires a large home with a yard. And because Broholmers can also be stubborn or willful, training is a must.","care-nutrition":"Broholmers need a high-quality diet that is age-appropriate. And because the breed is prone to weight gain, you should carefully monitor your Broholmer's food intake. Also, remember that giving too many treats can contribute to obesity.","care-grooming":"Regular weekly grooming and the occasional bath will ensure your Broholmer stays neat and tidy. Trim their fast-growing nails regularly to keep them from growing too long, as this can create problems with walking.\n\nBroholmers also benefit from a consistent [dental care routine](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-health). Ans their ears should be checked frequently to avoid wax buildup and debris.","care-exercise":"Given its size, the Broholmer is surprisingly agile. Though not particularly high-spirited, Broholmers do love being outdoors where they can play. And if Broholmers don't get daily exercise, they sometimes develop behavioral problems.\n\nMost Broholmers enjoy playing hide-and-seek, retrieving balls, and catching frisbees. These activities both exercise and entertain your Broholmer's body and mind. Like camping, hiking, frolicking in the park, or strolling around the neighborhood? Your Broholmer will be an eager tagalong. If you limit outdoor activity to your yard, make sure the area is fenced and secure.","care-training":"Training Broholmers is relatively easy, as they are intelligent and eager to please.

Many intriguing stories surround its beginnings—including one that suggests the breed lost its tail when Noah accidentally slammed it in the door of the ark.\n\nBut experts believe the Manx emerged several hundred years ago from a population of shorthair cats on the Isle of Man in the Irish Sea. When a dominant genetic mutation began causing taillessness, the trait spread quickly among cats on the island.\n\nLater, the Norwegian Forest Cat's ancestor was introduced to the island's cat population—resulting in a longhaired version of the Manx. Now known as a Cymric, these longhaired cats share the same breed standard as the Manx.\n\nThough many people associate Manx with taillessness, some cats of the breed do have normal tails. If a Manx has a full-length tail, they’re called a \"longie.\" If they have a nub or stump, they’re called a \"stumpie.\" Completely tailless cats go by \"rumpie,\" and rumpies with a rise of bone at the end of their spine are called \"risers.\"\n\nManx were one of the original breeds represented in the first cat shows in England and one of the the Cat Fanciers Association founding breeds in 1906.","facts":"The Manx is best known for its lack of a tail, dog-like behaviors, and affectionate personality. These cats form tight bonds with their people and love to participate in all household activities.","traits-appearance":"The Manx is a medium-sized breed with an overall round appearance. They are heavy, muscular cats with a well-balanced, compact structure.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Manx have a short, dense double coat. Their outer guard hairs have a somewhat hard texture and glossy appearance. They come in all coat colors and combinations and often display dramatic markings.","traits-physical":"This breed has a large, round head and chubby cheeks. Manx medium ears are wide at the base and taper slightly to a point. The color of their round, full eyes corresponds with their coat color. Their back legs are much longer than their front legs, causing their rumps to be noticeably higher than their shoulders.","temperament":"Manx are people-oriented cats that bond closely with their humans. They get along well with other pets and kids, making them an excellent addition to most families. Because they're so social, they don't like being left alone for long periods. But the company of another cat helps keep them from feeling lonely when no one else is around.\n\nA clown-like personality is a trademark of this breed. Some Manx are even known to play practical jokes on their people. They're also quick studies and can learn to fetch or perform simple tricks. But they sometimes use their intelligence for their own purposes—such as figuring out how to open doors or cabinets if they feel something on the other side is worth the effort.\n\nManx are playful cats that enjoy puzzle toys, games of chase, and showing off their impressive high jumping abilities and high-speed racing moves. These natural hunters will also do an admirable job of keeping the house mouse-free.","care-nutrition":"Manx require a high-quality diet to meet their nutritional needs. Because those needs vary for kittens, adults, and senior cats, opt for a formula that's age-appropriate for your pet.\n\nTo keep your cat at a healthy weight, measure out meals and reduce portions if necessary. And remember to account for snacks—just one ounce of cheese can exceed up to half their recommended daily calories.\n\nIn addition to regular meals, easy access to fresh, clean water is essential for all cats.","care-grooming":"The Manx's short coat needs minimal grooming. Brushing once a week is typically enough to keep it looking its best.\n\nMonthly nail trims will help keep your cat's claws at an appropriate length. Nails that get too long are more likely to snag on something and become torn or damaged. And overgrown nails can even grow into their paw pads, leading to pain or infection. In addition to clipping, providing a scratching post will allow your cat to maintain their nails themselves (and satisfy their instinct to scratch).\n\nDental hygiene is another critical component of every cat's care. From a young age, start your Manx on a dental routine that includes at-home teeth brushing and professional exams and cleanings.","care-exercise":null,"care-training":null,"care-health":"The genetic mutation that causes taillessness can also cause other health complications—including spinal cord or nerve damage, bladder or bowels problems, and digestive issues.

So, he crossed two hybrid breeds—the Desert Lynx and the Jungle Curl—to create the Highland Lynx.\n\nThe Highland Lynx is currently registered with the Rare and Exotic Feline Registry but no major cat associations. As selective breeding continued, breeders changed the name to Highlander because \"lynx\" refers to wild cats or a description in markings.\n\nIn 2008, The International Cat Association recognized the Highlander for competition in the Preliminary New Breed class.","facts":"Highlanders have a powerful, wild appearance. But they are gentle giants at heart. They love to be the center of attention and are excellent entertainers, playmates, and—like most cats—nappers.","traits-appearance":"The Highlander is a medium-to-large cat with a muscular, powerful body. Most Highlanders have curled ears and a short bob-like tail, but some are born with straight ears, a long tail, or polydactyl feet (extra toes).","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Both longhaired and shorthaired Highlanders exist. And their coats come in various colors and patterns—including solid, tabby, mink, tortoiseshell, pointed, and smoke.","traits-physical":"Highlanders' ears are among their most unique features. They stand tall and have a wide base, and—for many Highlanders—the top third of the ear has a loose backward curl. When this breed has a naturally short tail, it ranges in length from one to six inches. Highlanders also have a long, sloping forehead and medium-to-large eyes shaped like a flattened oval.","temperament":"Torn between getting a dog or a cat? Some say a Highlander is the best of both worlds. This intelligent breed can easily learn to fetch, walk on a leash, and sit. And don't be surprised if they meet you at the door with a toy in their mouth.\n\nA very active, powerful breed, Highlanders like to run, play, and chase. They are patient and gentle with kids, who are often their preferred playmates. Cat trees and durable toys will help prevent these high-energy kitties from getting bored.\n\nHighlanders have an affectionate nature and get along with everybody—including dogs and other pets. They love to be the center of attention and will clown around and perform tricks to entertain their humans.","care-nutrition":"Despite having ties to wild cats, Highlanders are a domestic breed with no special food requirements. A high-quality, commercially prepared diet will meet their nutritional needs. But because food needs vary for kittens, adults, and senior cats, opt for a formula that's age-appropriate for your pet.\n\nTo keep your cat at a healthy weight, monitor their food intake and reduce portions if they start to pack on the pounds. And don't forget to account for treats. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of a cat's calories.\n\nIn addition to regular meals, easy access to fresh, clean water is important to every cat's health.","care-grooming":"To remove dirt and loose fur, shorthaired Highlanders should be brushed once a week, longhaired Highlanders up to three times a week. It's also wise to trim your cat's nails monthly to prevent them from digging into their paw pads. Plus, nails that get too long are more likely to snag on something and become torn or damaged.\n\nHighlanders' ears tend to get wax buildup and thus require regular cleaning.

But documents dating to the 4th or 5th century BC details a cross between the Segugio Italiano (Coursing Hound) and the Asiatic Mastiff. Regardless of its actual beginnings, the breed was well-established by the Middle Ages. During the Renaissance, the Bracco Italiano—often shortened to \"Bracco\"—thrived under the breeding practices of the Medici and Gonzaga families.\n\nIn terms of appearance, the Bracco Italiano loosely resembles a cross between a German Shorthaired Pointer and Bloodhound. The breed came to the United States in the 1990s. A versatile gun dog, Bracco Italianos are tireless in the field, yet gentle in the home.","facts":"Bracco Italianos are intelligent, friendly, inquisitive, loyal, and active family dogs. These big pups love people and thrive on human companionship.","traits-appearance":"Bracco Italianos have a robust and powerful appearance. Their lean limbs, well-developed muscles, defined lines, and sculpted heads contribute to the breed's distinctive look.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Braccos have a beautiful, short, and glossy coat. It comes in several color variations—including solid white, white with orange markings, and white with brown markings. The markings are of varied sizes (e.g., patches, ticking, or roan). The breed standard is white with patches of orange in various sizes, or orange roan (i.e., speckling).","traits-physical":"The Bracco Italiano has an angular head, with a soft fold of skin that starts at the outer corner of the eye and falls down the cheek. When the head is down and relaxed, there is a skin fold across the skull from ear to ear.\n\nTheir eyes are relatively large, oval-shaped, and close-fitting. They range in color from dark amber to orange or brown—depending on the color of the coat—and offer a gentle, intelligent expression.\n\nThe Bracco's ears are at least half as wide as they are long, reaching the tip of their nose without being stretched. And their equally floppy lips reach down to the lower jaw.","temperament":"Bracco Italianos are very affectionate and make great family pets. They bond very closely with their families and thrive as human companions.\n\nThey are good with children and make excellent family members and housemates, as long as they get enough exercise. They also typically get along with other dogs and pets.\n\nBecause they originated as hunting dogs, they may chase wildlife and bark. Bracco Italianos also have a great sense of smell. And when they catch a scent, they may not be able to resist the urge to investigate if they aren't in a fenced area or on a leash.","care-nutrition":"Bracco Italianos are big dogs that eat a lot. As such, they need a high-quality diet appropriate for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). To best meet your Bracco's specific nutritional needs, your veterinarian may recommend a formula made specifically for large-breed dogs.\n\nAll dogs have the potential to become overweight or obese, and the Braccos are no exception. Help them stay at a healthy weight by monitoring their food intake closely. You can avoid accidental overfeeding by using a standard measuring cup to measure out meals. And be sure to take treats into account when tracking their daily calorie intake. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of their calories each day.","care-grooming":"The Bracco Italiano's grooming needs are minimal. Their coats typically require only a few minutes of brushing each week.\n\nBecause their long ears can be more susceptible to ear infections, Braccos need them routinely checked and cleaned.\n\nAll dogs need regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care), including at-home teeth brushing and professional dental cleanings. Maintaining good dental hygiene is key to their overall long-term health.","care-exercise":"Typical of hunting breeds, Braccos tend to have plenty of energy and require a lot of daily activity. Without enough exercise, they may turn to destructive behaviors.\n\nAllowing them to run in an enclosed yard and taking them on long walks or jogs are great ways to meet their physical exercise needs.

Spanish traders introduced these dogs in the 1500s, offering them to Cubans as gifts to smooth trade relations between the countries.\n\nOver centuries in Cuba, the breed—once called the Blanquito de la Habana, or Havana Silk Dog—was believed to be crossed with other breeds, including the [Poodle](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/poodle-standard). Most Havanese belonged to aristocrats and other members of the upper classes. Writers Ernest Hemingway and Charles Dickens owned Havanese.\n\nAfter being exported to Europe, Havanese became a popular performing breed, thanks to their ability to quickly master new tricks. Known as White Cubans, Havanese often performed in the circus.\n\nDuring the Communist takeover of Cuba in 1959, Havanese owners fled their island nation. Though many dogs were left behind, some families found a way to bring their pets to the United States. Those dogs became the first registered Havanese.","facts":"The Havanese is the National Dog of Cuba. These smart, social, little dogs have relaxed attitudes, adaptable natures, and a downright adorableness that has made them one of the fastest-growing breeds in the nation.","traits-appearance":"Havanese are small, sturdy dogs with mischievous expressions and a spring in their steps.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"It takes one touch of their coats to understand why the Havanese had nicknames like Havana Silk Dog. Their coats are light in texture and silky to the touch. Long, abundant, wavy hair stands slightly off their bodies and flows with movement. Puppies have shorter coats with softer textures than adult Havanese.\n\nTheir coats can be black, black and silver, black brindle, chocolate, cream, fawn, red, silver, white, gold sable, and gold brindle.","traits-physical":"The Havanese is slightly longer than tall, with shorter front legs and a rectangular shape. Their large, dark brown, almond-shaped eyes lend them an intelligent, mischievous expression. They have dropped ears with distinct folds and full, rectangular muzzles with broad noses.","temperament":"Although Havanese might not be the first breed that comes to mind for a guard dog, these are alert and intelligent dogs. They notice and alert their owners when something is amiss, but are never aggressive and rarely bark. These petite, quiet pups make excellent apartment dwellers (and can even learn to use indoor potty systems).\n\nHavanese are true lap dogs and prefer having their owners around most of the time. If left alone for long periods, they can become unhappy or anxious.\n\nThis extroverted breed likes being around people, performing tricks, showing off their friendly dispositions, and turning strangers into friends. Havanese are great with children and will allow their gentle affections. And with their background as circus performers, they eagerly learn new tricks.","care-nutrition":"Havanese require a high-quality dog food that's appropriate for their age and small size. This breed is prone to becoming overweight, so it's important to keep an eye on food intake. Avoid over-feeding by using a measuring cup to portion out their meals and limit treats to no more than 10% of their daily calories.","care-grooming":"It takes some effort to help Havanese maintain their silky coats. Daily grooming is required to keep their hair free of mats and tangles. The hair on their feet and between the pads should be neatly trimmed.\n\nSome people choose to have their Havanese's coat clipped to cut down on grooming (something not permitted in the show ring). Putting bows in their hair and having their coats corded are other ways to reduce grooming time—and add to their adorable appearances. Regular ear cleanings and nail trims should also be part of the grooming routine.\n\n[Dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) is essential to all dogs' long-term health. Start an at-home dental care routine that includes teeth brushing as part of a lifelong dental hygiene program.","care-exercise":"Havanese have moderate exercise needs. They love going for walks and playing hide-and-seek or fetch with their people. A dog park is also a good option for these social pups—as long as they remain separate from larger dogs. This breed is known to enjoy activities like agility, competitive obedience, and canine musical freestyle.\n\nHavanese are not known for their stamina, so focus on short bursts of exercise and look for cues (like panting or falling behind on a walk) that signal it's time for a break. Games and tricks also provide much-needed mental stimulation.\n\nDespite having thick coats, these small dogs are vulnerable to the cold. They shouldn't spend long periods outside in cold temperatures.","care-training":"Use positive reinforcement and reward-based training to help Havanese learn basic commands and new tricks. This eager-to-please breed learns fast, but they can also be sensitive, so avoid harsh training methods.\n\nStart introducing Havanese to new people, pets, and places when they're puppies. Positive experiences are an essential part of [socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) and will help ensure these dogs keep their outgoing personalities.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/havanese/\n\nhttps://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/dog-breeds/havanese\n\nhttp://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/Havanese.pdf","reviewed-by":"Cindy Elston, DVM, MPH","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":3.2,"weight-range-pet-max":7.3,"weight-range-show-min":3.2,"weight-range-show-max":5.9,"height-range-min":20.0,"height-range-max":28.0,"life-span-range-min":14.0,"life-span-range-max":16.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":78,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":47,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":35},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/355c361f-0c34-52d3-8135-b9fbdcd39a45/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/355c361f-0c34-52d3-8135-b9fbdcd39a45/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/355c361f-0c34-52d3-8135-b9fbdcd39a45/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/355c361f-0c34-52d3-8135-b9fbdcd39a45/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/355c361f-0c34-52d3-8135-b9fbdcd39a45/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/355c361f-0c34-52d3-8135-b9fbdcd39a45/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/355c361f-0c34-52d3-8135-b9fbdcd39a45/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/355c361f-0c34-52d3-8135-b9fbdcd39a45/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/355c361f-0c34-52d3-8135-b9fbdcd39a45/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/355c361f-0c34-52d3-8135-b9fbdcd39a45/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/355c361f-0c34-52d3-8135-b9fbdcd39a45/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/355c361f-0c34-52d3-8135-b9fbdcd39a45/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/355c361f-0c34-52d3-8135-b9fbdcd39a45/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/355c361f-0c34-52d3-8135-b9fbdcd39a45/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/355c361f-0c34-52d3-8135-b9fbdcd39a45/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/355c361f-0c34-52d3-8135-b9fbdcd39a45/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/355c361f-0c34-52d3-8135-b9fbdcd39a45/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/355c361f-0c34-52d3-8135-b9fbdcd39a45/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"357c27ee-68e0-5ea4-85e8-78924f18928e","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/357c27ee-68e0-5ea4-85e8-78924f18928e"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"poodle-miniature","name":"Miniature Poodle","plural-name":"Miniature Poodles","published-at":null,"species":"dog","history":"As the name implies, the Miniature Poodle is a smaller version of the [Standard Poodle](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/poodle-standard). So, understanding the history of this breed begins with unpacking the story of the original Poodle.\n\nDespite their strong association with the country, Poodles didn't originate in France. And no one really knows the full story behind the breed's origins. Poodles are likely related to the [Portguese Water Dog](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/portuguese-water-dog) and [Irish Water Spaniel](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/irish-water-spaniel). Some experts believe they originated in Central Europe or Russia, while others think they got their start in Spain or Portugal. Another common theory is that German soldiers brought the Poodle to France during the 1400s.\n\nRegardless of the breed's exact beginnings, everyone agrees that Poodles were bred for bird hunting and water retrieval. And their love of water is how they got their name. \"Poodle\" has its roots in an old German word meaning \"to splash about.\"\n\nWhat's the deal with the famous Poodle haircut? Hunters knew that Poodles would be more efficient swimmers if they had less hair. But less hair would leave them more vulnerable to the cold water. So, creative Poodle owners had an idea. They shaved most of the dog's body but strategically left puffs of hair to protect joints and vital organs from the cold. Problem solved.\n\nIn the 1700s, Standard Poodles became Miniature Poodles through selective breeding for a smaller size. Though several different sizes now exist, all Poodle varieties share the same breed standard.\n\nToday, there's no question that these smart, fun-loving little pups have won over pet parents everywhere. The Miniature Poodle is always among the most popular dog breeds.","facts":"At first glance, Miniature Poodles may not look like natural-born athletes. But don't let their small size fool you. The Mini Poodle is every bit the running, jumping, swimming dog as other breeds in the sporting group. This breed just fits on your lap better after a full day of fun!","traits-appearance":"The Miniature Poodle is an elegant, well-proportioned, breed with a frizzy and curly coat.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Miniature Poodle's dense coat can be curly (frizzy curls over the whole body) or corded (even cords that hang in varying lengths). Poodle owners often give their pups stylized haircuts or a \"puppy clip\" that trims hair to an even length over the whole body.\n\nMini Poodles come in a wide range of colors—including solid blacks, grays, silvers, browns, apricots, creams, and shading variations.","traits-physical":"The Miniature Poodle has dark, oval-shaped eyes that offer an alert, intelligent expression. Covered in long, wavy hair, the ears are long enough to reach the corner of the lip when pulled forward.","temperament":"The Miniature Poodle is an incredibly smart, playful breed that's perfect for people wanting a \"big dog\" personality in a small (and adorable) package. They make great housemates and get along well with kids, dogs, and other pets.\n\nMini Poodles love people and form tight bonds with their families. And because of their sensitive nature, they even pick up on the moods of people they're close to. This intuitive nature—coupled with their willingness to please—makes the Miniature Poodle a great assistance and therapy dog.\n\nMiniature Poodles may bark, and some can be reserved around strangers. [Early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) can help prevent these and other undesirable behaviors.","care-nutrition":"Small dogs like Miniature Poodles have little stomachs that don't allow them to eat big meals. So, it's best to break their food up into several small meals throughout the day.\n\nMini Poodles also need a dog food formulated for their specific life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). And a diet created for small-breed dogs will have the appropriate blend of nutrients and a smaller kibble size that helps them properly chew and digest their food. Foods developed specifically for Poodles are another great option to consider.\n\nTo prevent your Mini Poodle from becoming overweight, keep a close eye on their food portions. And be sure to take treats into account when tracking their daily calorie intake. Even a couple treats can add up to a lot of extra calories for a Miniature Poodle. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of a dog's calories.","care-grooming":"Miniature Poodles have hair instead of fur. That means—unlike fur coats that grow to a point and then shed—a Poodle's hair keeps growing. Similar to human hair, their hair does still fall out. But it usually falls back into their coats (instead of all over the house). Because of this minimal shedding, Miniature Poodles are an excellent breed for people with allergies.\n\nThough Miniature Poodles don't shed a lot, their coats still need regular grooming. To keep their hair free from mats and tangles, brush a few times a week. And because their hair grows continuously, plan on haircuts every month or so.\n\nMiniature Poodles are particularly at risk for dental issues due to their small mouths and crowded teeth. All dogs require regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care)—including at-home teeth brushing and professional dental cleanings. But Mini Poodles may require more frequent cleanings beginning at an earlier age.","care-exercise":"The Miniature Poodle is a very athletic breed that enjoys all the same activities as other dogs in the sporting group. Long walks, jogs, agility, retrieving, rally, and swimming are fun ways for a Poodle to burn off energy. Or for something a little different, try musical canine freestyle—a mix of obedience training, dance, and tricks.","care-training":"Mini Poodles are very bright dogs, and therefore easy to train. Because they're so responsive and eager to please, reward-based training using treats or favorite toys is the best approach with these pups.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/lifestyle/10-facts-about-poodles/\n\nhttp://www.fci.be/Nomenclature/Standards/172g09-en.pdf\n\nhttp://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/Poodle.pdf\n\nhttps://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/dog-breeds/miniature-poodle\n\nhttp://www.allpoodleinfo.com/poodle-temperament","reviewed-by":"Annette Louviere, DVM","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":6.8,"weight-range-pet-max":12.7,"weight-range-show-min":5.9,"weight-range-show-max":11.8,"height-range-min":25.0,"height-range-max":38.0,"life-span-range-min":10.0,"life-span-range-max":18.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":98,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":58,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":40},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/357c27ee-68e0-5ea4-85e8-78924f18928e/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/357c27ee-68e0-5ea4-85e8-78924f18928e/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/357c27ee-68e0-5ea4-85e8-78924f18928e/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/357c27ee-68e0-5ea4-85e8-78924f18928e/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/357c27ee-68e0-5ea4-85e8-78924f18928e/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/357c27ee-68e0-5ea4-85e8-78924f18928e/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/357c27ee-68e0-5ea4-85e8-78924f18928e/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/357c27ee-68e0-5ea4-85e8-78924f18928e/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/357c27ee-68e0-5ea4-85e8-78924f18928e/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/357c27ee-68e0-5ea4-85e8-78924f18928e/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/357c27ee-68e0-5ea4-85e8-78924f18928e/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/357c27ee-68e0-5ea4-85e8-78924f18928e/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/357c27ee-68e0-5ea4-85e8-78924f18928e/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/357c27ee-68e0-5ea4-85e8-78924f18928e/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/357c27ee-68e0-5ea4-85e8-78924f18928e/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/357c27ee-68e0-5ea4-85e8-78924f18928e/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/357c27ee-68e0-5ea4-85e8-78924f18928e/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/357c27ee-68e0-5ea4-85e8-78924f18928e/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"35b740e4-3b84-5751-9f95-66601d652e92","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/35b740e4-3b84-5751-9f95-66601d652e92"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"ocicat","name":"Ocicat","plural-name":null,"published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"cat","history":"The Ocicat owes it beginning to a happy accident. In 1964, Breeder Virginia Daly began crossing Abyssinians with Siamese, hoping to create a Siamese with Aby color points. She didn't expect that the second litter would also include an ivory kitten with golden spots.\n\nDaly's daughter thought this kitten, named Tonga, resembled an ocelot and suggested he be called an Ocicat. Though Tonga was beautiful, Daly's intent was not to breed spotted cats. So, she sold Tonga as a pet under the pretext that the new owner would have the cat neutered.\n\nShortly after, Daly connected with geneticist Dr. Clyde Keeler. He wanted to develop a breed similar to the extinct Egyptian Spotted Fishing Cat and thought Daly's spotted cat would be an excellent start. Daly repeated her previous steps and produced another spotted male. She then introduced the American Shorthair into the mix for body substance and to bring in the silver color.\n\nOther breeders soon grew interested in Ocicats. But efforts to develop the breed slowed substantially when Daly had to step away from her work to care for a sick relative. After more than a decade, the program started back up. And in 1986, the Ocicat received its first championship status.","facts":"Ocicats may resemble small wildcats. But they're friendly, family-oriented cats at heart. These adorably spotted kitties are also impressive athletes, social butterflies, and devoted pets.","traits-appearance":"Ocicats are medium-sized cats with an athletic, muscular build. They have a wild but graceful appearance and spotted coat that comes in various colors.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Ocicat's short, sleek coat has a satiny texture. The breed may be 12 different colors: tawny (brown spotted), chocolate, cinnamon, blue, lavender (lilac), fawn, ebony silver, chocolate silver, cinnamon silver, blue silver, lavender silver, and fawn silver. All Ocicats have darker spots that contrast with their lighter primary color.\n\nExcept for on the tip of the tail, every hair on an Ocicat has several bands of color. The way these bands combine is what creates the thumbprint-shaped spots on their coats.","traits-physical":"Ocicats have wedge-shaped heads, broad muzzles, large, almond-shaped eyes, and alert, moderately large ears. Their legs are medium-length and strong, and their tails are relatively long—with a slight taper and dark tip.","temperament":"Confident and people-oriented, Ocicats make devoted family pets. They're smart and can adapt to different environments, as well as learn to follow commands. But because of their social nature and love of attention, they don't like to be left alone. If your schedule requires you to be gone for long hours, consider getting other \"sibling\" pets to keep them company.\n\nThis athletic, active breed has a lot of energy. Ocicats love to play, chase, pounce, and show off their high-jumping abilities. Just be mindful when it comes to games of tug-of-war that some Ocicats can get possessive of their toys.\n\nMany Ocicats have a dog-like disposition and, with training, can learn to fetch or do tricks. But when it's time to settle down, they're more than happy to curl up in the lap of their favorite person.","care-nutrition":"Ocicats don't have any particular dietary concerns, but they do require high-quality dry or wet food. Because nutritional needs vary for kittens, adults, and senior cats, opt for a formula that's age-appropriate for your pet. And remember to leave fresh, clean water out for your cat at all times.","care-grooming":"The Ocicat's coat is very low maintenance and doesn't require regular brushing. Their nails, however, should be trimmed monthly. Nails that grow too long can injure your cat's paw pads—leading to pain, infection, or difficulty walking or using the litter box.\n\nDental care is also core to any grooming routine. Beginning in kittenhood, accustom your Ocicat to regular at-home teeth brushing, as well as periodic exams and professional cleanings.","care-exercise":null,"care-training":null,"care-health":"Roughly one out of every three cats in the United States is overweight or obese.

Dating back to 1200 B.C., these working dogs are among the oldest British breeds. And their name comes from \"kergie,\" the Celtic word for dog.\n\nThroughout history, these small but powerful dogs made excellent herders. Their size puts them at the perfect height to nip at the heels of cattle—without being kicked. Cardigan Welsh Corgis also served as guardians. They moved cattle during the day and guarded them at night, barking to scare off predators and alert owners of trouble.\n\nThe first pair of breeding Cardigan Welsh Corgi arrived in the U.S. in 1931. Though this breed is well-known, it's not as popular as the [Pembroke Welsh Corgi](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/pembroke-welsh-corgi). (Cardigan Welsh Corgis often intermingled with Pembroke Welsh Corgis, but the two have been distinct breeds since the late 1800s.)","facts":"Cardigan Welsh Corgis are athletic working dogs with stamina to spare. Though small, these dogs have a big bark that makes them excellent watchdogs. And when not on the job, the Cardigan Welsh Corgi is an affectionate companion.","traits-appearance":"Cardigan Welsh Corgis are powerful, low-set, sturdy dogs with heavy bones and deep chests. The handsome breed moves with speed and endurance.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"This double-coated breed has a short, soft, thick undercoat and a longer, harsh outer coat that lies smooth. Cardigan Welsh Corgis have short hair on their ears, head, and legs. The hair on their bodies is a little longer, and thick hair around their necks, chests, shoulders (creating a ruff), back of thighs, and underside of their tails is the longest of all.\n\nCardigan Welsh Corgis come in all shades of red, sable, and brindle—as well as black with or without tan or brindle points—and blue merle, defined as black and gray, marbled. White on the neck, chest, legs, muzzle, underparts, tip of tail, and head (as a blaze) is possible. But white should never be the predominant color.","traits-physical":"Cardigan Welsh Corgis are low-set dogs that are much longer than tall. These dogs have firm and level toplines, broad chests, strong, well-muscled hindquarters, and tails that are set low and reach well below the hock. The Cardigan Welsh Corgi's large and prominent ears are slightly rounded at the tips. Its medium-to-large, widely set eyes convey an alert, gentle, watchful expression.","temperament":"Cardigan Welsh Corgis are active, affectionate dogs. Despite having short legs, these canines are quick and agile. And a history of cattle herding has also given the rugged breed a love for the outdoors.\n\nCardigan Welsh Corgis adore their families and are generally great with other pets and children. They're adaptable—comfortable living in an apartment or on a ranch (or somewhere in between), as long as they get the mental and physical exercise they crave.","care-nutrition":"Cardigan Welsh Corgis need a high-quality dog food formulated for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). These dogs can easily become overweight, and excess weight strains their long backs—potentially leading to disc problems. To avoid this, measure out your dog's meals, and limit treats to no more than 10% of their daily calories.","care-grooming":"Regular grooming will keep your Cardigan Welsh Corgis looking their best. A good brushing at least once per week removes cast-off hair and minimizes shedding. During spring and summer—when these dogs are shedding more than usual—regular baths and daily brushing with an undercoat rake will help loosen excess hair.\n\nTrimming nails, cleaning ears, and [brushing teeth](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) should also be part of every dog's grooming routine, regardless of breed.","care-exercise":"Cardigan Welsh Corgis are little dogs with large exercise needs. Besides herding cattle or sheep, the energetic breed enjoys walks, hikes, and trips to the dog park. Due to their short legs and bulky bodies, Cardigan Welsh Corgis are not great swimmers and cannot keep up on a fast run.\n\nThese highly intelligent dogs also excel in dog sports, such as agility, obedience, rally, and tracking. But keep in mind, the Cardigan Welsh Corgi's long back is injury-prone. So, you should avoid activities that require a lot of jumping or stairs.","care-training":"Stubborn and sensitive, Cardigan Welsh Corgis require consistent, gentle training that focuses on positive reinforcement and rewards. When they get it, they master basic commands and learn new tasks quickly.\n\n[Early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) is also essential for this breed. When your Cardigan Welsh Corgi is a puppy, introduce them to activities that allow them to engage with others—even if it's simply interacting with neighbors during a walk around the block. This will help them grow into a well-adjusted adult dog.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/cardigan-welsh-corgi/\n\nhttp://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/Cardigan_Welsh_Corgi.pdf","reviewed-by":"Annette Louviere, DVM","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":10.4,"weight-range-pet-max":19.1,"weight-range-show-min":11.8,"weight-range-show-max":15.0,"height-range-min":25.0,"height-range-max":33.0,"life-span-range-min":12.0,"life-span-range-max":15.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":96,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":59,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":40},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3626e349-d381-553f-9068-5f08fabe2153/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3626e349-d381-553f-9068-5f08fabe2153/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3626e349-d381-553f-9068-5f08fabe2153/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3626e349-d381-553f-9068-5f08fabe2153/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3626e349-d381-553f-9068-5f08fabe2153/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3626e349-d381-553f-9068-5f08fabe2153/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3626e349-d381-553f-9068-5f08fabe2153/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3626e349-d381-553f-9068-5f08fabe2153/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3626e349-d381-553f-9068-5f08fabe2153/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3626e349-d381-553f-9068-5f08fabe2153/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3626e349-d381-553f-9068-5f08fabe2153/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3626e349-d381-553f-9068-5f08fabe2153/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3626e349-d381-553f-9068-5f08fabe2153/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3626e349-d381-553f-9068-5f08fabe2153/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3626e349-d381-553f-9068-5f08fabe2153/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3626e349-d381-553f-9068-5f08fabe2153/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3626e349-d381-553f-9068-5f08fabe2153/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3626e349-d381-553f-9068-5f08fabe2153/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"36c37d94-3f22-59d0-b5ff-8ff967cd5612","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/36c37d94-3f22-59d0-b5ff-8ff967cd5612"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"greenland-dog","name":"Greenland Dog","plural-name":"Greenland Dogs","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"One of the oldest dog breeds, the Greenland Dog likely descended from dogs the Thule people used for transportation in Siberia more than 1,000 years ago. And genetic testing revealed that Greenland Dogs share genetic similarities with the now-extinct Taimyr wolf.\n\nInuit people brought the dogs to Greenland 850 years ago, where they remained isolated from other breeds. Today, efforts are underway to preserve the breed's purity and cultural history.","facts":"Greenland Dogs are hardy, stoic working dogs that love spending time outdoors. If you're looking for a hiking buddy that's happy to carry your gear, the Greenland Dog is the breed for you.","traits-appearance":"The Greenland Dog is a muscular, spitz-type breed built for endurance and strenuous work in arctic conditions. These pups have short, rectangular bodies, powerful legs, and big, rounded feet with strong nails and pads.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"A thick double coat consisting of a dense undercoat and straight, coarse outercoat protects the Greenland Dog from harsh weather. The hair is short on the head and legs and longer on the body. Thick fur on their ears protects these dogs from frostbite.\n\nThe breed standard permits all coat colors and patterns except merle markings and albinos.","traits-physical":"Greenland Dogs have broad, wedge-shaped heads, triangular pointed ears, and a thick, bushy tail that they carry in a curve or curled over the back.","temperament":"This active, tireless breed is a great choice for outdoorsy families that love adventures. These pups get along with most people but don't tend to attach themselves to any one person.\n\nGreenland dogs don't bark, but they do howl and often serenade their humans (and their neighbors). They also make a screaming sound that is typically joyful, though it may not seem that way to those unfamiliar with the breed.\n\nThese pups form close bonds with other dogs in their \"pack\" but can be territorial around new dogs. [Socializing them when they're young](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) will curb this behavior and help them develop into well-mannered adult dogs.","care-nutrition":"These dogs thrive on a high-quality diet formulated for their life stage. Working Greenlands need their diets adjusted seasonally. (More protein during the winter months when they're pulling sleds, and less in the summer when they're not as active.)\n\nTo help your dog maintain a healthy weight, measure their portions to avoid overfeeding and keep an eye on how many treats you're giving them. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of a dog's calories.","care-grooming":"For most of the year, weekly brushing is enough to keep the Greenland's coat in good shape. But when they blow their coats (once a year), more frequent brushing can help remove all the loose fur—and spare your furniture.\n\nTo reduce your pup's risk of ear infections, check their ears regularly and clean them as needed to remove wax build-up and debris. Nail trims should also be part of the grooming routine since overly long nails can cause pain and potentially lead to problems running or walking.\n\nLastly, good [dental hygiene](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) will support your dog's overall health. Dental disease is one of the most common health conditions in adult dogs. Left untreated, it can contribute to other serious issues. In addition to professional cleanings, establish an at-home dental care program that includes regular teeth brushing and veterinarian-recommended dental chews.","care-exercise":"These energetic pups need a lot of daily exercise. They make great hiking companions and running buddies. They're also happy to pull their people in sleds or wagons. Dog sports, such as agility and tracking, are also a fun way for this breed to burn energy.","care-training":"The Greenland is typically obedient and eager-to-please. But it's important to establish yourself as the pack leader and set clear boundaries.

Inside the temple stood a statue of a golden goddess with sapphire eyes. When raiders attacked the temple, mortally wounding a priest, one of the cats came to his master and stood on his chest as he died.\n\nAs the story goes, the priest's soul entered the cat's body and transformed its appearance into what we now know as a seal point Birman—with pure white paws and sapphire eyes like the goddess. The day after the cat's passing, the other 99 cats also transformed, leading to the belief that when a Birman cat dies, a priest's soul escorts it to heaven.\n\nLegends aside, the Birman breed—or \"the Sacred cat of Burma\"—first gained recognition in France in the 1920s. England then acknowledged the breed in 1966, and the United States followed suit in 1967.\n\nThe Birman has since earned a place on the list of most popular cat breeds in the world—which isn't surprising, given their mystique, charming personalities, and striking looks.","facts":"Birmans are an ancient breed, but their beauty never gets old.

They're known for their \"gloves\" and \"laces\"—pure white paws with white fur that extends up the back of their hocks.\n\nAll Birman kittens are born white, and color comes in as they mature. With 20 different colors possible, they can range from shades of light ivory to warm gold. And all pointed colors are allowed under the breed standard.\n\nPopular colors are seal point (warm cream with dark brown points), blue point (bluish-white with slate blue points), chocolate point (ivory with milk chocolate points), and lilac point (almost white with pinkish grey points). Birmans also come in red point and assorted tabby and parti-color points.","traits-physical":"One notable trait of Birmans is their Roman nose, which has a prominent bridge that appears curved when viewed from the side. They also have strong chins and somewhat rounded muzzles. Their medium-length ears are almost as wide as they are tall. And their round, vivid, blue eyes give them a sweet expression. Medium-length legs, round, large paws, and a medium-length tail round out their appearance.","temperament":"Birmans are an excellent cat breed for families. They are laid back, adapt well to various home environments, and tend to get along with other cats, cat-friendly dogs, and kids.\n\nKnown for having affectionate, loyal personalities, Birmans love to follow their humans around (or meet new ones) and enjoy relaxing on a warm lap. Their gentle, quiet, social nature makes them a great pet for seniors.\n\nBirmans also have a playful streak and enjoy chasing balls or playing with interactive toys. However, they never get too hyper or demanding. They're a low-maintenance cat that rarely causes trouble and fits into just about any family dynamic.","care-nutrition":"Birmans require high-quality cat food. Because nutritional needs vary for kittens, adults, and senior cats, take care to choose a formula that's age-appropriate for your pet.\n\nTo help keep their weight in a healthy range, measure out meals and reduce portions if your cat gains weight. Also, keep an eye on how many treats you give them. Just one ounce of cheese can account for half their recommended daily calories. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of a cat's calories.\n\nIn addition to daily meals, be sure to provide plenty of fresh, clean water.","care-grooming":"Despite their longish hair, Birmans' coats are relatively easy to maintain. Because they have a single coat, they shed minimally throughout most of the year. Brushing once a week with a comb is typically sufficient to keep their coats looking their best. That said, you may need to brush more frequently in the spring—when they shed their winter coats.\n\nBirmans also need their claws trimmed regularly. If left too long, claws may dig into your cat's paws and cause pain or infection. Nails that get too long are more likely to snag on something and become torn or damaged, as well. In addition to clipping, providing a scratching post will help keep their nails in good shape and satisfy their instinct to scratch.\n\nFinally, dental care is essential to any cat's lifelong health. So from a young age, start your cat on a dental routine that includes at-home teeth brushing and professional exams and cleanings.","care-exercise":null,"care-training":null,"care-health":"Roughly one of every three cats in the United States is overweight or obese. And that extra weight can contribute to other health risks—such as arthritis, diabetes, and heart problems. Your veterinarian is the best resource for tips on keeping your cat at a healthy weight.","references":"http://www.birmancatclub.co.uk/origins.html\n\nhttps://cfa.org/birman/\n\nhttps://www.tica.org/breeds/browse-all-breeds?view=article&id=1186:the-birman-breed&catid=48\n\nhttps://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/cat-breeds/birman\n\nhttps://cfa.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/birman-standard.pdf\n\nhttp://www.birmancatclub.co.uk/thebirman.html\n\nhttps://www.banfield.com/pet-healthcare/pet-healthcare-resources/nutrition/food-amounts-and-helping-prevent-obesity\n\nhttps://www.banfield.com/pet-healthcare/additional-resources/article-library/conditions-illnesses/understanding-the-health-risks-of-obesity\n\nhttps://www.humanesociety.org/resources/cats-destructive-scratching","reviewed-by":"Annette

Siberian Laika","plural-name":"East Siberian Laikas","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The East-Siberian Laika is one of several Laika breeds found in Russia and Siberia. As their name suggests, they originated from the eastern part of Siberia, east of the Jenisej river. The breed belongs to the Spitz family of dogs—the group most closely related to wolves.\n\nSiberian hunters couldn't afford specialized dogs for different types of prey. So, East-Siberia Laikas hunted everything from forest birds to furred animals to big game. Before it was outlawed, they even hunted Siberian tigers. These powerful dogs also pull sleds during long hunting expeditions.\n\nLaikas bark to alert the hunter when they locate game. That's how they got their name—the Russian word \"laika\" is a noun derived from the verb \"layat,\" which means \"barker.\"\n\nThe UKC recognized the East-Siberian Laika in 1996.","facts":"East-Siberian Laikas are intelligent, energetic, and watchful dogs. They have strong hunting instincts, fast reactions, and an incredible sense of direction.","traits-appearance":"The East-Siberian Laika is the largest of the Russian Laika breeds. These strong dogs have a heavy bone structure and a square or slightly rectangular body.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"This breed has a medium-length, double coat consisting of a coarse, straight outer coat and a soft, dense undercoat. The fur forms a collar around the neck and shoulders, and male dogs have a mane over the withers.\n\nStandard colors include salt and pepper, white, grey, black, red, and brown. Some coats have patches and ticking.","traits-physical":"Laikas have a wedge-shaped head, dark, oval eyes, prick ears, and a tail that curls over the back.","temperament":"The Laika is a courageous, affectionate, highly versatile breed. These dogs are protective of their people and make excellent guard dogs. But they have a territorial nature and may act aggressively toward dogs of the same sex that approach their property.\n\nMale Laikas are typically friendly toward strangers, whereas females tend to be more aloof. It's essential to [socialize](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) these pups so they learn to respond appropriately to different people and situations.","care-nutrition":"East-Siberian Laikas thrive on a high-quality diet formulated for their activity level, medium size, and life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). To help your dog maintain a healthy weight, monitor their food intake—including treats. As a rule, treats should make up no more than 10% of a dog's calories.","care-grooming":"Laikas are naturally clean dogs that don't produce much (if any) smell. But their thick coats do need regular brushing to remove loose hair and prevent mats and tangles.\n\nMost of the year, brushing with a pin brush once or twice a week will suffice. But during seasonal shedding periods, daily brushing is needed to keep the hair from getting out of control.\n\nBeyond that, regular nail trims, ear cleanings, and teeth brushing should also be part of a well-rounded grooming routine.","care-exercise":"This active breed needs a lot of daily exercise to be happy and healthy. Long walks, hikes, and games within a fenced backyard will provide an outlet for their boundless energy.","care-training":"Laikas are intelligent and very responsive to training. A gentle and varied (to keep things interesting) approach is the best way to teach these pups.","care-health":null,"references":"https://russkaja-laika.jimdofree.com/laika-breeds/east-siberian-laika/\n\nhttps://russkaja-laika.jimdofree.com/laika-breeds/\n\nhttps://www.ukcdogs.com/east-siberian-laika","reviewed-by":"Laura

modern recreation of the Calupoh began in the mid-90’s, inspired by the ancient “loberro,” or Mexican wolfdog. Remains of at least 70 loberros dating from 100 BC - 1500 AD have been found and studied by archaeozoologists. These dogs were concentrated in temples, caves and burials in central Mexico, suggesting they were the second most common “breed” at that time. \n\nIn the pre-Hispanic culture of Teotihuacan, as well as later cultures, dogs were purposefully hybridized with wolves to create revered animals bearing the dual spiritual significance of the wolf as a symbol of war, night, the underworld and power, and the dog, a symbol of rain, agriculture, good fortune and fertility. These hybrids were used as special sacrifices in rituals to communicate with the gods, as symbols and gifts of the elite, and as emblems of protection by warriors. Appropriately, the modern Calupoh was chosen to be primarily black in color, as early domestic dogs are thought to be the source of this coloration in wolves. The Calupoh is a symbol and celebration of ancient Mexican cultures’ esteem for these wolfdog hybrids.\n\nIn 1999, the Federación Canófila Mexicana recognized the Calupoh as the third Mexican dog breed (after the [Chihuahua](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/chihuahua) and [Xoloitzcuintli](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/xoloitzcuintli)).","facts":"The Calupoh is a large, noble dog with wolf-like characteristics. This breed makes an excellent companion for families and adventure seekers.","traits-appearance":"The Calupoh has many wolf-like traits, including a powerful head and skull, a strong neck, and a thick mane. This large breed is agile, balanced, and powerful.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"This breed has a medium-length, weather-resistant double coat that's rough on the outside with a soft inner layer. Their coats are primarily black or smoky black, though some turn silver in adulthood. White spots on the chest and feet are permitted in the breed standard.","traits-physical":"Notable traits of the Calupoh include yellow or orange eyes, large, erect ears, and an elegant but strong body.","temperament":"Calupohs are noble dogs known for their loyalty and stable personality. They are tolerant dogs that are well-suited for family life and are particularly good around kids. They typically get along well with other dogs, though they may be shy around strangers. ","care-nutrition":"The Calupoh does well on high-quality dog food formulated for their age, size, and activity level. In particular, puppies may benefit from a large-breed growth diet. These specially formulated diets help prevent large breed dogs from growing too fast, which may decrease the likelihood or severity of hip dysplasia as they age.\n\nTo help Calupohs maintain a healthy weight, measure their meals to avoid overfeeding and keep treats to 10% or less of their daily calories.","care-grooming":"The Calupoh's double coat requires frequent brushing to remove loose hair and keep it looking its best. During seasonal shedding, daily brushing will help keep the fur tumbleweeds at bay.\n\nAdditionally, regular ear checks, nail trims, and [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) should be part of their grooming routine.","care-exercise":"The Calupoh is always up for adventure. Daily brisk walks, long hikes, and dog sports are great outlets for their energy.","care-training":"These pups are always eager to please their people and respond well to consistent training using positive reinforcement techniques.\n\nIn addition to obedience training, all breeds benefit from [early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization). Helping them feel comfortable with different people and environments when they're young will help them grow into well-adjusted adult dogs.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.arba.org/PDF%20Files/Group1/calupoh.pdf\n\nhttp://www.calupoh.com/","reviewed-by":"Casey Knox, DVM","date-reviewed":"2023-07-11T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":27.0,"weight-range-pet-max":54.0,"weight-range-show-min":27.0,"weight-range-show-max":54.0,"height-range-min":58.0,"height-range-max":75.0,"life-span-range-min":10.0,"life-span-range-max":14.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":null,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":null,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":null},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/37df7374-653f-50da-979d-207f91317e36/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/37df7374-653f-50da-979d-207f91317e36/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/37df7374-653f-50da-979d-207f91317e36/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/37df7374-653f-50da-979d-207f91317e36/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/37df7374-653f-50da-979d-207f91317e36/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/37df7374-653f-50da-979d-207f91317e36/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/37df7374-653f-50da-979d-207f91317e36/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/37df7374-653f-50da-979d-207f91317e36/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/37df7374-653f-50da-979d-207f91317e36/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/37df7374-653f-50da-979d-207f91317e36/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/37df7374-653f-50da-979d-207f91317e36/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/37df7374-653f-50da-979d-207f91317e36/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/37df7374-653f-50da-979d-207f91317e36/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/37df7374-653f-50da-979d-207f91317e36/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/37df7374-653f-50da-979d-207f91317e36/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/37df7374-653f-50da-979d-207f91317e36/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/37df7374-653f-50da-979d-207f91317e36/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/37df7374-653f-50da-979d-207f91317e36/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"38dde1b6-f189-5b1c-9241-25a8fd60750a","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/38dde1b6-f189-5b1c-9241-25a8fd60750a"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"icelandic-sheepdog","name":"Icelandic Sheepdog","plural-name":"Icelandic Sheepdogs","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"Despite its name, the Icelandic Sheepdog is not from Iceland. To anyone's knowledge, there were no dogs on the uninhabited island of Iceland when Norse settlers arrived in 874 AD. The settlers brought their dogs—now known as Icelandic Sheepdogs—to help create a new Scandinavian nation.\n\nThe spitz-type dogs (with potential relations to [Karelian Bear Dogs](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/karelian-bear-dog)) were used to herd sheep, cattle, and horses and retrieve puffins from their underground burrows. Reportedly, the Danish Army used Icelandic Sheepdogs in the field, taking advantage of their stamina to deliver orders between units. Nowadays, the dogs perform search and rescue—and are still used for herding and searching for lost sheep.\n\nIn the mid-1500s, the British began exporting Icelandic Sheepdogs from Iceland. These herding dogs became faithful companions to the upper classes—but it was not just the wealthy who fell in love with the breed. English shepherds also coveted Icelandic Sheepdogs for their skill and work ethic and put them to work herding sheep in the countryside.\n\nIts intelligence, devotion, and big \"smile\" have made the Icelandic Sheepdog a highly coveted breed. No longer just farm dogs, they are treasured family pets.","facts":"The Icelandic Sheepdog is an alert, active breed. Their vocal (but not aggressive) natures make them excellent guard dogs. And their outgoing and devoted personalities make them ideal family pets.","traits-appearance":"Icelandic Sheepdogs are just under medium-size with confident, lively bearings and gentle, intelligent expressions.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Icelandic Sheepdog can have two distinct coat types: short-haired or long-haired. Both are double-coated and have thick, soft undercoats and coarse outercoats. The long-haired Icelandic Sheepdogs, as their names suggest, have much longer hair. The short-haired Icelandic Sheepdogs have medium-length hair on their outer coats. The tails of both are bushy with lengths appropriate to their coat lengths.\n\nTheir coats can come in several colors. These include various shades of tan (ranging from cream to reddish-brown), chocolate brown, grey, and black. White is mixed with all of these colors, though it shouldn't be the predominant color. The most common white markings include a blaze on the face, collar, chest, socks, and the tip of the tail. Icelandic Sheepdogs with tan and grey coloring often have black masks and black tips on their tails. Black tri-color dogs have black coats with white and tan markings.","traits-physical":"Icelandic Sheepdogs have a strong, almost rectangular build. They have short, tapered muzzles, medium, almond-shaped eyes with black rims, and erect ears with slightly rounded tips. Their bodies are long and muscular with no loose skin, and their tails are high set and curled over, touching their backs.","temperament":"Icelandic Sheepdogs are cheerful, outgoing, curious, and playful dogs. They get along well with people and other animals and, though they will bark if strangers approach, they're not aggressive. These devoted dogs bond closely with their people and want to be part of all activities. Leave them alone too long, and they will become stressed and sad.\n\nIcelandic Sheepdogs have strong herding instincts, and they tend to be vocal. Though these are excellent skills for moving livestock between pastures, they may not be ideal for families with small children (who the dogs will likely herd) or apartment life.\n\nIcelandic Sheepdogs have great speed and stamina and require regular exercise. Due to their roots, the breed prefers cold weather and can overheat in high temperatures.","care-nutrition":"Icelandic Sheepdogs require high-quality dog food that's appropriate for their age and activity level.","care-grooming":"Due to their thick double coats, Icelandic Sheepdogs are profuse shedders that require regular grooming. Brush their coats at least once a week—and once a day during spring and fall shedding seasons—to remove dirt and prevent matting. Trim their nails and clean their ears to keep the breed looking and feeling its best.\n\nA [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) routine, including at-home teeth brushing and professional dental cleanings, should be a regular part of their grooming. Start when Icelandic Sheepdogs are young to ensure good oral hygiene throughout their lives.","care-exercise":"Herding is a fast-paced activity that requires a lot of endurance, and Icelandic Sheepdogs are perfect for the job. In the absence of livestock to herd, these dogs need a lot of exercise to burn off their abundant energy. Icelandic Sheepdogs make excellent running or hiking partners and will gladly keep pace for miles. But even walks and play sessions can go a long way toward tiring out this energetic breed.\n\nIcelandic Sheepdogs are smart, agile, and eager to please. These qualities make them naturals for dog sports such as competitive obedience, tracking, agility, rally, and, of course, herding. Their favorite activities are the ones they get to share with their people.","care-training":"Their laidback natures and eager-to-please personalities make Icelandic Sheepdogs easy to train. Sign them up for obedience classes when they're young to get off to a good start. It's best to focus on positive, rewards-based training—the breed does not respond well to harsh criticism. In no time, they'll master basic commands and learn new

Hound","plural-name":"Swiss Hounds","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The Swiss Hound's origin can be traced back to Roman times—when depictions of the breed appeared in mosaics from Avenches, Switzerland. In the 15th century, Italian dog lovers commonly sought after the breed.\n\nIn the 18th century, Swiss Hounds made their way into French hunters' hearts, thanks to their talented noses and exceptional aptitude for hunting hare.\n\nMercenaries brought French scent hounds to Switzerland, and these dogs influenced the Swiss Hound's breed lines. The United Kennel Club recognized the Swiss Hound in 2006. Today, the breed remains a talented hunting companion in Switzerland (though it's uncommon outside of Europe).","facts":"The Swiss Hound is a natural-born hunter. These energetic, intelligent dogs possess a keen sense of smell. Though known to be lively when hunting, they make docile, loyal companions when home with their people.","traits-appearance":"The Swiss Hound is a medium-sized dog with great strength and endurance. The breed's overall appearance suggests an air of nobility.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Swiss Hounds have a short, smooth, and dense coat with very fine hair on the head and ears. Their coats come in four color varieties.\n\nThe Bernese variety is white with black patches and tan markings around the face. Jura Swiss Hounds are tan with a black blanket and black or tan markings on the face. Lucernes are \"blue,\" with a combination of black and white hairs and heavy speckling, black patches or saddle, and tan markings on the face. And Schwyz Swiss Hounds are white with orange patches or saddle.","traits-physical":"The Swiss Hound's head shape is long, lean, and slightly rounded. Like most hounds, this breed's ears are set low and narrow, often reaching the top of the nose. Swiss Hounds have medium-length tails that curve slightly upward.","temperament":"Swiss Hounds are passionate, confident, agile hunting companions. But when not engaged in a hunt, they make loving, even-tempered pets. These sensitive dogs grow very attached to their humans. They're usually friendly and easy to train—a great fit for many families.\n\nThe hunting and tracking instinct is powerful in Swiss Hounds. For this reason, they may be unpredictable around small animals. (They often can't help chasing any little critter that crosses their paths.)\n\nSwiss Hounds can be very vocal. Some people consider their musical baying a source of entertainment. But in an apartment with shared walls, noise-sensitive neighbors may be less fond of their singing skills.","care-nutrition":"Swiss Hounds do best on a diet formulated for their activity level, medium breed size, and life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior).\n\nAll dogs are at risk for obesity if they overeat. So, keep a careful eye on your pup's food intake, including treats. As a rule, treats should make up no more than 10% of their calories.","care-grooming":"Thanks to their short coats, the Swiss Hound's grooming needs are relatively minimal. Still, these dogs do require regular brushing to keep their coats free of loose hair and dirt.\n\nWith long ears, Swiss Hounds may be more prone to ear infections. Check your dog's ears regularly for dirt or wax build-up, and clean them as needed. Nail trims and dental care—including at-home teeth brushing and professional dental cleanings—should also be part of their routine care.","care-exercise":"Swiss Hounds have a lot of energy and stamina. When hunting, they can follow a scent for hours. So, if they're not serving as hunting companions, these dogs need plenty of daily exercise and mental stimulation.\n\nThey seem to enjoy hiking, jogging, and long walks. True to their hound dog heritage, they also appreciate canine sports that allow them to use their powerful sense of smell—such as tracking and nose work.","care-training":"Swiss Hounds are intelligent, eager-to-please pups. These qualities make them very trainable. They respond best to positive reinforcement techniques and short training sessions that keep them from becoming bored.\n\nEarly socialization is also essential for Swiss Hounds. Introducing them to many different people, places, and pets from a young age will help them develop into well-mannered adult dogs.","care-health":null,"references":"http://www.fci.be/Nomenclature/Standards/059g06-en.pdf\n\nhttps://www.eukanuba.co.uk/breeds/swiss-hound-(schweizer-laufhund)#breed-history\n\nhttps://www.ukcdogs.com/swiss-hound\n\nhttps://www.dogtemperament.com/swiss-hound-temperament\n","reviewed-by":"Annette Louviere, DVM","date-reviewed":"2020-09-05T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":8.2,"weight-range-pet-max":18.1,"weight-range-show-min":8.2,"weight-range-show-max":18.1,"height-range-min":47.0,"height-range-max":58.0,"life-span-range-min":10.0,"life-span-range-max":12.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":null,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":null,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":null},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3a3224c3-61a0-53f7-8968-56228ed57c9e/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3a3224c3-61a0-53f7-8968-56228ed57c9e/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3a3224c3-61a0-53f7-8968-56228ed57c9e/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3a3224c3-61a0-53f7-8968-56228ed57c9e/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3a3224c3-61a0-53f7-8968-56228ed57c9e/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3a3224c3-61a0-53f7-8968-56228ed57c9e/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3a3224c3-61a0-53f7-8968-56228ed57c9e/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3a3224c3-61a0-53f7-8968-56228ed57c9e/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3a3224c3-61a0-53f7-8968-56228ed57c9e/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3a3224c3-61a0-53f7-8968-56228ed57c9e/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3a3224c3-61a0-53f7-8968-56228ed57c9e/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3a3224c3-61a0-53f7-8968-56228ed57c9e/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3a3224c3-61a0-53f7-8968-56228ed57c9e/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3a3224c3-61a0-53f7-8968-56228ed57c9e/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3a3224c3-61a0-53f7-8968-56228ed57c9e/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3a3224c3-61a0-53f7-8968-56228ed57c9e/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3a3224c3-61a0-53f7-8968-56228ed57c9e/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3a3224c3-61a0-53f7-8968-56228ed57c9e/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"3a71a8e3-6966-5366-a5ad-5246472c3174","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3a71a8e3-6966-5366-a5ad-5246472c3174"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"siberian","name":"Siberian","plural-name":null,"published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"cat","history":"References to Siberian cats date back as far as 1000 AD. Designed to withstand harsh climates, this native Russian breed acted as rodent control for farmers in the Siberian forest. They also served as beloved house cats to Russian families, who praised them for their loyalty and loving personalities.\n\nSiberians appeared as one of three longhair breeds in the first cat show in London in 1871. By the 1980s, the cat fancy had gained momentum in Russia, and people began keeping records about the breed. The first cat show in Leningrad in 1987 marked the official beginning of the Siberian breeding program in Russia.\n\nAfter the Cold War ended in 1990, the first Siberians arrived in America. The next year, more cats followed, and the United States breeding program was soon up and running. Cat associations began accepting the breed in the early 1990s, but it wasn't until 2006 that the CFA granted Siberians Championship status.","facts":"The Siberian is a robust and fearless breed with an affectionate nature and sweet expression. These cats enjoy companionship of all kinds, but many have an affinity for children, in particular. When you bring a Siberian into your life, you are adding a devoted friend to the family.","traits-appearance":"Siberians are medium-to-large cats that exude power, balance, and strength. This hefty breed can take up to five years to fully mature. In general, their body structure is round rather than angular.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Siberians have a thick, water-resistant triple coat (perfect for protecting them during harsh Russian winters). Their hair is moderately long with a full ruff around the collar. Thick curls may develop on their belly and britches, though the coat itself is not wavy overall. Siberians come in all coat color and pattern combinations.","traits-physical":"Siberians have a wedge-shaped head with rounded corners. Their ears are medium-sized and rounded, with furnishings that cover the base. These cats have medium-sized round eyes that are alert and expressive. Their bodies are sturdy, well-muscled, and solid. Toe tufts and a bushy tail complete their winter-proof appearance.","temperament":"Siberians have an easygoing, unflappable nature. They are well-suited to busy households and love being around other pets and kids. In fact, Siberians don't like to be alone and prefer to live in a two-cat home. The buddy system is the way to go for these friendly felines.\n\nAcrobatic by nature, Siberians regularly wow their families with their impressive leaps, agile maneuvers, and balancing acts. It's not uncommon to find them on top of the refrigerator or tiptoeing across a cluttered shelf. They're also very playful and will turn any available object into a toy. But they like their downtime, too. Siberians make excellent couch buddies and snuggle partners.\n\nThis intelligent breed is a skilled problem solver and can learn how to open doors or cabinets—especially if they know there is something of interest on the other side. Siberians are famous for their emotional intelligence, as well. They often sense if someone needs moral support and take it upon themselves to be there for their humans.","care-nutrition":"Siberians require a high-quality diet. Because nutritional needs vary for kittens, adults, and senior cats, opt for a formula that's age-appropriate for your pet.\n\nTo prevent overfeeding, monitor your cat's food intake and reduce portions if they start to gain weight. And remember to count treats. As a guideline, they should make up no more than 10% of a cat's daily calories.\n\nBesides regular meals, easy access to fresh, clean water is a must for any cat.","care-grooming":"Despite their thick triple coat, Siberians don't shed very much. Brushing once or twice a week is usually enough to prevent tangles. However, these cats do molt twice a year. During such periods—which last about 10 days—they require daily brushing to remove loose fur and prevent matting.\n\nRoutine nail clipping is also important, as nails that get too long are more likely to snag on something and become torn or damaged. Overgrown nails can also grow into your cat's paw pads, leading to pain or infection. In addition to clipping, providing a scratching post will help keep their nails in good shape and satisfy their instinct to scratch.\n\nFinally, dental hygiene is an essential component of every cat's care. The sooner you start your Siberian on a routine that includes at-home teeth brushing, the better. They should also regularly see a veterinarian for exams and professional cleanings.","care-exercise":null,"care-training":null,"care-health":"Roughly one out of every three cats in the United States is overweight or obese. And those extra pounds can contribute to other health risks, such as arthritis, diabetes, and heart problems. Besides keeping your Siberian's weight in check, screening for Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy is also wise. This condition decreases the heart's efficiency and can lead to other issues. Your veterinarian is your best resource for discussing these and other health concerns for your cat.","references":"https://cfa.org/siberian/siberian-article/\n\nhttps://cfa.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/siberian-standard.pdf\n\nhttps://tica.org/breeds/browse-all-breeds?view=article&id=878:siberian-breed&catid=79\n\nhttps://tica.org/breeds/browse-all-breeds?view=article&id=1919\n\nhttps://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/cat-breeds/siberian\n\nhttps://www.banfield.com/state-of-pet-health/obesity","reviewed-by":"Annette Louviere, DVM","date-reviewed":"2021-02-23T00:03:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":4.5,"weight-range-pet-max":9.1,"weight-range-show-min":null,"weight-range-show-max":null,"height-range-min":null,"height-range-max":null,"life-span-range-min":12.0,"life-span-range-max":15.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":null,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":null,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":null},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3a71a8e3-6966-5366-a5ad-5246472c3174/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3a71a8e3-6966-5366-a5ad-5246472c3174/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3a71a8e3-6966-5366-a5ad-5246472c3174/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3a71a8e3-6966-5366-a5ad-5246472c3174/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3a71a8e3-6966-5366-a5ad-5246472c3174/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3a71a8e3-6966-5366-a5ad-5246472c3174/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3a71a8e3-6966-5366-a5ad-5246472c3174/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3a71a8e3-6966-5366-a5ad-5246472c3174/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3a71a8e3-6966-5366-a5ad-5246472c3174/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3a71a8e3-6966-5366-a5ad-5246472c3174/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3a71a8e3-6966-5366-a5ad-5246472c3174/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3a71a8e3-6966-5366-a5ad-5246472c3174/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3a71a8e3-6966-5366-a5ad-5246472c3174/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3a71a8e3-6966-5366-a5ad-5246472c3174/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3a71a8e3-6966-5366-a5ad-5246472c3174/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3a71a8e3-6966-5366-a5ad-5246472c3174/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3a71a8e3-6966-5366-a5ad-5246472c3174/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3a71a8e3-6966-5366-a5ad-5246472c3174/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"3a74519f-4ec2-5348-b724-e772f2392546","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3a74519f-4ec2-5348-b724-e772f2392546"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"manchester-terrier","name":"Manchester Terrier","plural-name":"Manchester Terriers","published-at":null,"species":"dog","history":"The Manchester Terrier hails from Manchester, England, where it historically hunted rats and rabbits. During the 19th century, England needed a solution for its massive rat problem. So, John Hulme crossed a [Whippet](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/whippet) and a dark brown terrier.\n\nThe resulting terrier breed was extremely popular among tavern owners. After closing, the owners would let the dogs roam their taverns to clear out the rats. The breed's supreme skill for this job earned it the nickname \"Rat Terrier.\" The name \"Manchester Terrier\" didn't arise until the 1860s—when Manchester became the dogs' breeding center.\n\nManchester Terriers arrived in the United States in the late 1860s. And the American Kennel Club recognized the Manchester Terrier in 1887.","facts":"Manchester Terriers are energetic, intelligent, and alert dogs. They're also loyal, loving, and protective of family and territory. There are two varieties of the Manchester Terrier: the Standard and the Toy. Except for different sizes and ear carriage standards, there are no major distinctions between the two types.","traits-appearance":"A small, black, short-coated dog, the Manchester Terrier has a sleek yet substantial and refined appearance.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Manchester Terrier is jet black and rich mahogany tan. The tan markings are on similar locations on every Manchester Terrier.","traits-physical":"A spirited and athletic breed, the Manchester Terrier has a long, wedge-shaped head and attractive pointy ears.","temperament":"Small, clever, and confident dogs, Manchester Terriers can move at great speeds. They have amazing agility skills, too. But they aren't the best lap dogs.\n\nThat said, Manchester Terriers are usually affectionate with adults and children. In fact, they often demand attention and enjoy lots of love, bonding quickly with people. With a bright and charming personality, the Manchester Terrier is a fine companion for any family.\n\nThis breed may be wary around strangers. Its loud bark will warn of possible danger, making it an excellent watchdog.","care-nutrition":"Manchester Terriers need high-quality food appropriate for their age and size.\n\nIt's important to monitor the amount of food you feed your Manchester Terrier and reduce portions if your pup gains weight. Also, remember that giving too many treats in addition to regular meals can contribute to obesity.","care-grooming":"Grooming is easy with the Manchester Terrier—occasional baths are typically all they need to stay clean.\n\nEvery couple of weeks, you should also trim your dog's nails to prevent splitting. Likewise, aim to check your Manchester Terrier's ears regularly to avoid a buildup of wax and debris.","care-exercise":"Quick and lively, the Manchester Terrier is an athletic dog that needs a good walk a few times a day to support its mental and physical well-being.\n\nThough these pups may enjoy life as couch potatoes some of the time, they're usually eager to chase a ball or run in the great outdoors. Manchester Terriers also enjoy dog sports such as agility, tracking, flyball, and both rally and competitive obedience.","care-training":"Manchester Terriers are easy to train and inquisitive—eager learners that like to show off their abilities. Your pup's training should start early and be firm yet gentle and consistent.\n\nThough Manchester Terriers are stubborn, they will thrive in a reward-based training environment. Treats and favorite toys can provide excellent motivation.\n\nAll dogs benefit from [early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization), as it helps them be more comfortable around strangers and other animals.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Australian_Terrier/08IKBgAAQBAJ\n\nhttps://www.google.com/books/edition/Medical_Genetic_Behavioral_Risk_Factors/wU5tBgAAQBAJ\n\nhttps://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/manchester-terrier-standard/","reviewed-by":"Cindy

Terrier","plural-name":"Sealyham Terriers","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"Captain John Edwards developed the Sealyham Terrier between 1850 and 1891 at his estate in Wales. He wanted to create a breed that would excel at hunting small game—such as badgers, otters, and foxes—above and below ground.\n\nExperts think Edwards bred the [Basset Hound](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/basset-hound), [Bull Terrier](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/bull-terrier-standard), [Fox Terrier](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/fox-terrier-smooth), [West Highland White Terrier](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/west-highland-white-terrier), and [Dandie Dinmont Terrier](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/dandie-dinmont-terrier) to produce the Sealyham Terrier. The breed came to the United States in 1910 and earned recognition from the American Kennel Club a year later. Today, Sealyham Terriers are most popular in England and South Africa.","facts":"Sealyham Terriers are high-spirited, affectionate, and loyal to those they love. Though brave, alert, and independent, they're friendly toward other pets and children. As a result, the Sealyham Terrier makes a wonderful family dog.","traits-appearance":"Low to the ground, the Sealyham Terrier has short legs that allow it to be fast and agile while hunting small game.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Sealyham Terrier has a wiry double coat and is generally white. But black, lemon, tan, and badger-colored markings on the head and ears are possible.","traits-physical":"Notable features of the Sealyham Terrier include a slightly domed head and long bangs.","temperament":"Sealyham Terriers are hardy souls full of character and spunk. Seeming to have a sense of humor, they can also sometimes be a bit stubborn.\n\nBecause of their size and personality, they're well-suited for both city and country life. Sealys are good with children, too. But all interactions between kids and dogs require adult supervision.\n\nSealys may be reserved or suspicious around strangers, and they often don't get along well with other dogs. Because of the breed's hunting background, they may bark, dig, and chase wildlife.","care-nutrition":"Sealyham Terriers need a high-quality, age-appropriate (e.g., puppy, adult, senior) diet. To keep your Sealy at a healthy weight, monitor how much they eat, measure out meals, and reduce portions if necessary. Also, remember that giving too many treats can contribute to obesity.","care-grooming":"The Sealyham Terrier's double coat doesn't shed. But the abundant hair on the dog's legs and body tends to mat easily. Combing and brushing every few days can help prevent this.\n\nTrimming nails, cleaning ears, and [brushing teeth](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) should also be part of your Sealy's grooming routine.","care-exercise":"Sealyham Terriers may be less energetic than other terriers. But they still need moderate exercise. Walking down the block, fetching a ball, and playing tug-of-war are all acceptable ways to get your Sealyham off the couch.\n\nThe breed also seems to enjoy dog sports—such as agility, earthdog trials, tracking, flyball, and obedience.

The breed traces its origins to the Border Collie, which breeders then crossed with smaller longhaired breeds to create a small dog to herd sheep, ponies, and chickens.\n\nShetland Sheepdogs worked on local farms, called “toons,” leading to the slang nickname Toonie Dog. Their small size proved to be a significant benefit: The diminutive dogs ate less than larger breeds, an essential trait on a remote island where food was scarce.\n\nTheir geographic isolation meant that Shetland Sheepdogs, also known as Shelties, lived in isolation.\n\nShelties remained virtually unknown outside of the Shetland Islands until the early 1900s. Recognized as the Shetland Collie when the breed gained admission to the Kennel Club in England in 1909, the breed soon became named the Shetland Sheepdog.","facts":"The Shetland Sheepdog is a small, alert, working dog. Though it bears a striking resemblance to the rough-coated Collie, this is a breed all its own, prized for its intelligent, obedient, and affectionate nature.","traits-appearance":"Shetland Sheepdogs are small, longhaired dogs that move with effortless speed and a trotting gait and appear to have alert, gentle, intelligent expressions.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Shetland Sheepdogs have double coats: their short undercoats are so dense that it causes the outer coat to “stand off” of their bodies; the outer coat is long, straight hair with a harsh texture. A smooth coat is considered a serious fault.\n\nShetland Sheepdogs have smooth hair on their faces, tips of their ears, and feet, and abundant hair on their mane and frill, which are more pronounced in males. The breed standard allows excess hair on ears, feet, and on hocks to be trimmed for the show ring.\n\nThe breed comes in three colors: black, blue merle, and sable (with colors ranging from light golden through mahogany) and marked with varying white or tan.","traits-physical":"These are small dogs with muscular backs, deep chests, and broad, strong thighs. Their tails are long and carried straight down or in a slight upward curve at rest.\n\nShelties have well-rounded muzzles; small ears set high and carried three-quarters erect; and almond-shaped dark eyes (with blue or merle eyes allowed in dogs with blue merle coloring).","temperament":"Shetland Sheepdogs are loyal, affectionate family pets. Shelties will adapt to life in the city as long as they get regular exercise. Their herding instincts could lead Shetland Sheepdogs to chase moving cars or other animals, so a fenced yard is a good idea.\n\nTheir tendency to bark may not endear Shetland Sheepdogs to the neighbors, but the breed does make an excellent watchdog.","care-nutrition":"Feed Shetland Sheepdogs a high-quality dog food appropriate for their life stage (puppy, adult, senior). Portion out their food with a measuring cup and limit treats to no more than 10 percent of their daily calories to prevent overfeeding.","care-grooming":"Shetland Sheepdogs need regular attention to keep their hair free of mats, tangles, and debris. Weekly brushing with a pin brush will remove dead undercoat and keep their coats looking sleek. Pay special attention to the areas around the ears, under the elbows on each front leg, and the “pants” under the tail, which are more prone to matting.\n\nShetland Sheepdogs require almost-daily grooming during shedding season to remove dead hair and keep up with excess shedding. Their coats protect against the elements, so shaving their coats is not recommended.\n\nShetland Sheepdogs benefit from a regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) routine that includes at-home teeth brushing and professional cleanings. Start these grooming practices when Shetland Sheepdogs are puppies to ensure they become a habit.","care-exercise":"Like other herding breeds, Shetland Sheepdogs require moderate amounts of exercise to be happy and healthy.\n\nIn addition to walks, hikes, and trips to the dog park, Shetland Sheepdogs also enjoy dog sports such as obedience competitions, agility, tracking, herding, and other activities that allow the breed to show off speed and stamina and spend time with their owners.\n\nMental stimulation is important, too. Provide puzzle toys or engage Shetland Sheepdogs in games like fetch or hide and seek to engage their minds and their bodies.","care-training":"Shelties are intelligent, eager to please, and trainable. With positive reinforcement and rewards, Shetland Sheepdogs can master basic commands and learn new tricks. Consistent training can also help teach these vocal dogs to stop barking.\n\n[Early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) can help make Shetland Sheepdogs feel more comfortable with strangers.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/shetland-sheepdog/\n\nhttp://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/ShetlandSheepdog.pdf","reviewed-by":"Laura Inman,

Newfoundland originated in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador. Though one of the older dog breeds, its exact roots are a matter of debate.\n\nSome say there’s evidence of a large dog similar to the Newfoundland in the archeological records of the early Algonquin and Sioux Indians. Other stories suggest European fishermen bred their dogs with native dogs found on the island. And according to one legend, a dog resembling the Newfoundland accompanied Leif Erikson when the Vikings landed on the coast of Newfoundland over 1,000 years ago.\n\nThe history of the Newfoundland became clearer in the late 1700s when the first document stories of the breed started to appear. The breed officially got its name in 1775, when a man by the name of George Cartwright gave the name to his dog. Fans of the breed, however, refer to them affectionately as “Newfies.”\n\nThe first Newfoundland club started in England in 1886. People bred the dogs for their considerable strength and their ability to cart and haul. In particular, fishermen used the dogs to pull their full nets out of the water. They also made exceptional water rescue dogs, thanks to their excellent swimming skills. Stories of the breed’s bravery and heroics are documented throughout history.","facts":"The Newfoundland is a loyal, devoted breed with a loving personality. They may be massive, but their patience and gentle, sweet-tempered nature have earned them the nickname of “nanny dog.”","traits-appearance":"The most noticeable element of the Newfoundland’s appearance is its sheer size. The breed is large and muscular, with a massive head, heavy coat, and broad, strong tail.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Newfie has a flat, water-resistant double coat. The coarse outer coat is moderately long, while the undercoat is dense and soft. The coat comes in gray, brown, black, and white and black.","traits-physical":"Despite its size, the Newfoundland is agile and relatively athletic. The breed has a massive head, dark brown, expressive eyes, and a smooth, effortless gait.","temperament":"Newfoundlands are known for their sweet dispositions. Add to that their social, patient, and loyal nature, and it’s easy to see why these dogs make great family pets. Newfies are intelligent and relatively easy to train. And they’re never shy or aggressive.","care-nutrition":"Newfoundlands require high-quality dog food suited for their particular age—as well as any health concerns.\n\nNewfoundlands are at risk for a dangerous condition called bloat. To help prevent bloat, break their food up into several meals a day, and use a specially designed food bowl to slow their eating. When timing meals, avoid feeding them immediately after any kind of vigorous activity—and wait at least an hour after meals before exercising them. These are just a few ways you can help prevent this life-threatening condition. A veterinarian is the best resource for other recommendations—including surgical options—for preventing bloat.\n\nAs with any dog, it’s important to monitor the amount of food and treats that you give your Newfoundland—especially since some dogs are prone to weight gain as they age. Your veterinarian is a good source for nutrition and feeding guidelines.","care-grooming":"A Newfie’s heavy coat requires regular grooming. Brush them at least once a week with a long-toothed comb and slicker brush to keep their coats healthy and mat-free. During periods of seasonal shedding, their coats need daily brushing.\n\nAll dogs need regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care), including at-home teeth brushing and professional dental cleanings. Maintaining good dental hygiene is important for their overall long-term health.","care-exercise":"Newfoundlands need at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise a day to stay healthy and happy. They enjoy outdoor activities and spending time with their people, so walks and hikes with the family are fun options. Or, take advantage of their love of water and head to the lake for a swim. They also enjoy dog sports, such as tracking and agility.","care-training":"Newfoundlands are smart and eager-to-please. Although they aren’t generally aggressive or shy, [early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) and training are important to help them be well-adjusted pups.\n\nObedience training is also essential because of their large size.

Hunters crossed bird and water dogs with scent hounds to develop the breed. In 1897, Baron von Schorlemer wrote the first standard for the breed, thus laying the foundation for the modern purebred program.\n\nThe German Longhaired Pointer's adaptability to work in the field, water, or forest makes the breed adept at tracking a variety of game in different settings.\n\nFun fact: German Longhaired Pointers are among the few major gun dog breeds for which black is not an acceptable coat color.\n\nThough the American Kennel Club does not currently recognize the breed, it has been a member of the Foundation Stock Service since 2010.","facts":"German Longhaired Pointers are calm, intelligent, and hardworking dogs. This breed has a unique ability to switch from relaxed household pet to tenacious hunter.","traits-appearance":"German Longhaired Pointers have strong, muscular, low-set bodies, and flowing lines.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The coat of the German Longhaired Pointer is precise—not too long and not too short. On the back and sides of the body, the hair is close-fitting. On the neck, chest, and belly, the coat may be longer. The hair on the head is much shorter, whereas hair on the ears is wavy and feathered. Feathering on the back of front and hind legs forms breeches.\n\nThe German Longhaired Pointer's coat is a rich brown, sometimes with white or roan speckling.","traits-physical":"German Longhaired Pointers have slightly rounded heads with a gently rising stop. Their folded ears turn forward slightly, and they carry their tails horizontally—with the last third curving slightly upwards.","temperament":"German Longhaired Pointers are calm and sweet-natured—very affectionate and people-oriented. These characteristics make them an ideal breed for families, provided they can be part of an active household where they get plenty of physical and mental exercise.\n\nGerman Longhaired Pointers are usually good with children and get along with other dogs. But due to their background as hunters, they may chase or hunt small animals, including cats or wildlife.","care-nutrition":"German Longhaired Pointers need a high-quality food that's appropriate for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior) and activity level. To prevent them from becoming overweight, monitor the amount of food and treats they eat each day. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of a dog's calories.","care-grooming":"Brush German Longhaired Pointers occasionally to remove loose hair and dirt from their coats. Additional upkeep may be required after these dogs hunt in heavy cover, as their long coats can attract burs.\n\nLong ears can make German Longhaired Pointers more susceptible to ear infections. Routinely check and clean their ears to prevent infections from developing. And as you should with all dogs, clip nails regularly to prevent splitting or cracking.\n\nIn addition to professional dental cleanings, establish an at-home dental care routine that includes regular teeth brushing. Maintaining good [dental hygiene](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) is essential for the overall long-term health of all dogs.","care-exercise":"German Longhaired Pointers have a higher exercise requirement than most dogs. Since they have a very strong prey drive, hunting and retrieving are their preferred ways to stay active.\n\nThat said, other excellent options include long daily walks, running in enclosed yards, hiking, and swimming. Activities such as agility, competitive obedience, and rally are also great ways to provide exercise and mental stimulation.","care-training":"The German Longhaired Pointer is an extremely intelligent, trainable breed. Positive reinforcement and a firm, consistent approach help keep stubborn tendencies at bay.\n\nAs with all breeds, German Longhaired Pointers benefit from [Early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) to help them develop into well-adjusted adult dogs.","care-health":null,"references":"http://www.germanlonghairpointers.com/breedinformation.html\n\nhttp://www.fci.be/Nomenclature/Standards/117g07-en.pdf\n\nhttps://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/german-longhaired-pointer/\n\nhttps://www.petguide.com/breeds/dog/german-longhaired-pointer/","reviewed-by":"Cindy

Van","plural-name":null,"published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"cat","history":"The Turkish Van originated in a mountainous region of Eastern Turkey in the Middle Ages. The breed got its name—and likely its swimming skills, too—from nearby Lake Van. Vans have a unique coat texture that makes their fur water-resistant, allowing them to happily splash around in the water. In fact, locals dubbed them the \"swimming cats.\"\n\nIn 1955, two British women traveling in Turkey discovered the Van's love of water after someone gifted them a male and female pair. One hot day, they stopped at a stream for a swim and were surprised to see the two cats join them. They decided to bring the cats home to England, where they began promoting the rare breed.\n\nThe first Van arrived in the United States in 1982—when a couple traded their award-winning Balinese to a French breeder for a Turkish Van. But the breed remains extremely rare, with few cats available for export from their native land.","facts":"The Turkish Van is an intelligent, high-energy breed that likes to run, play, and—believe it or not—swim. Devoted and affectionate, these felines have a quiet voice and sound more like sheep than cats.","traits-appearance":"Turkish Vans are large, agile cats with a sturdy build. Their well-developed chests and substantial legs give them a strong, powerful overall appearance.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Vans have semi-long hair with a cashmere-like texture. The length varies by season, with a shorter coat in the summer and a longer, thicker coat in the winter. These cats also have feathering on their ears, legs, feet, and belly and a ruff of fur around their necks.\n\nThe Van's coat is either solid white or van-patterned (a term used to describe white cats with colored heads and tail markings). The most common color for their markings is auburn. But they can be any traditional color.","traits-physical":"Turkish Vans have broad, wedge-shaped heads, prominent cheekbones, and rounded muzzles. Their moderately large ears sit high and slightly rounded at the tip. Acceptable eye colors include blue, amber, or odd-eyed (one of each color). Vans often hold their long, plumed tails erect and wave them when they run.","temperament":"If the Turkish Van had a motto, it would be: why walk when you can run? These high-energy cats are always on the go. Favorite activities include jumping, climbing, racing around the room, and fetching toys. They also genuinely love water. Though other cat breeds know how to swim, they typically do so only when necessary (a literal \"sink or swim\" situation). Turkish Vans are the only cat breed known to swim simply because they want to.\n\nLoyal cats that want to be with their humans, Vans often follow people around and rub up against their legs as a sign of affection. But they don't usually like to be picked up or cuddled for long periods. That said, they will sometimes curl up in a lap—but only when it's their idea.\n\nVans tend to get along well with dogs and older kids. Because they play a bit rough, these cats do best in homes without small children.","care-nutrition":"Turkish Vans are high-energy cats that require a quality diet to meet their nutritional needs. Because those needs vary for kittens, adults, and senior cats, opt for a formula that's age-appropriate for your pet.\n\nEven though Vans are active, they are still at risk for obesity if they overeat. To keep your cat at a healthy weight, measure out meals and reduce portions if necessary. And don't forget to account for calories from treats in their daily totals. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of a cat's calories.\n\nFinally, all cats need access to fresh, clean water around the clock.","care-grooming":"The Turkish Van's coat isn't prone to mats or tangles. Still, they require regular brushing to remove loose fur and help prevent hairballs.\n\nMost cats' nails require monthly trimming to prevent them from getting too long. Long nails are more likely to snag on something and become torn or damaged. They can even grow into your cat's paw pads, leading to pain or infection. In addition to clipping, providing a scratching post will allow your cat to do some nail maintenance themselves (thanks to their instinct to scratch).\n\nGood dental hygiene is also essential to a Van's overall health.

Originally bred to hunt badgers, Dachshunds also successfully hunted larger game.\n\nThe shorthaired (or smooth) variety is the original breed in the Dachshund family. But breeders later focused on creating wirehaired and longhaired types, as well as miniaturized sizes of all three.\n\nTo develop the wirehaired type, breeders likely crossed shorthaired Dachshunds with hard-coated terriers and wirehaired pinschers—such as the [Schnauzer](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/schnauzer-standard), [Dandie Dinmont Terrier](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/dandie-dinmont-terrier), [German Wirehaired Pointer](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/german-wirehaired-pointer), and [Scottish Terrier](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/scottish-terrier).\n\nThe origin of the longhaired type is less clear. Some experts speculate that shorthaired Dachshunds occasionally produced puppies with longer hair. Another theory proposes that the longhaired variant came from crossing shorthaired Dachshunds, various small land and water spaniels, and the German Stoberhund.\n\nThe Dachshund came to the United States in 1885 and received American Kennel Club recognition that same year.","facts":"The Dachshund is an alert, lively, and active breed. These beautiful, spunky dogs tend to be protective of their families, making them vigilant watchdogs. And though they may be small, Doxies have big personalities.","traits-appearance":"The Dachshund's famously long body and short legs earned the breed the humorous nicknames \"hot dog\" and \"wiener dog.\" But the elegance and beauty of these little dogs are no joke.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Dachshund has three coat types: shorthaired, longhaired, and wirehaired. The shorthaired coat is sleek and shouldn't be too thick. The hair of the longhaired type is longest on the ears, chest, and tail. The wirehaired variety has a short, rough, tightly uniform outer coat with a finer, somewhat softer undercoat. The wired hair covers the whole body and creates distinctive facial furnishings.\n\nThe breed comes in various colors—including solid or bicolor combinations of light and dark black, red, and tan shades. Brindle and dapple patterns are also possible, with some dapple Doxies having blue eyes.","traits-physical":"It's easy to recognize Dachshunds by their long-backed bodies, pointy noses, and short (but powerful) legs.","temperament":"The Dachshund is a friendly, affectionate breed that loves to be surrounded by family. These pups prefer to be in on the action rather than left alone outdoors.\n\nThanks to their hunting dog lineage, Doxies often bark, scratch at the ground, dig, or chase wildlife. They're also sometimes suspicious or fearful of strangers—especially if they're trying to avoid being picked up, which can cause discomfort to their long bodies if not done properly.","care-nutrition":"Dachshunds thrive on a high-quality dog diet formulated for their age and size. Take care not to overfeed these pups, as any excess weight strains their backs—potentially leading to disc problems.","care-grooming":"The Dachshund is a clean breed, with little or no smell.\n\nThe shorthaired variety needs only occasional brushing, whereas brushing requirements for a longhaired Dachshund depend on coat thickness. Thicker coats benefit from more frequent brushing to keep hair free from tangles and control the moderate shedding. Lastly, wirehaired Doxies do best when their coats are combed a couple of times a week and hand-stripped several times a year.\n\nTo reduce your dog's chance of ear infections, check their ears regularly and clean them as needed to remove wax build-up and debris. Nail trims should also be part of every pup's grooming routine.\n\nAnd don't forget those teeth. Good [dental hygiene](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) will support your dog's overall health. So, in addition to professional cleanings, establish an at-home dental care program that includes regular teeth brushing and veterinarian-recommended dental chews.","care-exercise":"Not every activity is appropriate or safe for Dachshunds due to their unique build. For instance, you should avoid long runs, hurdling fences, and vigorous swims. That said, this active breed is always eager to get out and have some fun in other ways.\n\nIn fact, Doxies need regular exercise to stay in shape and build the muscles needed to protect their backs. Just steer clear of activities that involve jumping or climbing stairs to prevent injuries.","care-training":"With their keen sense of smell and strong prey drive, Dachshunds may choose to pick up a scent and follow it rather than obey instructions. So, patience is a virtue when training this independent breed. A kind tone and positive, reward-based approach are the best tools for training these sensitive dogs.\n\nDachshunds tend to be protective of their family and territory. [Socializing them as puppies](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) will ensure they develop into well-mannered adult dogs.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/dachshund/","reviewed-by":"Annette Louviere, DVM","date-reviewed":"2021-07-09T19:21:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":2.3,"weight-range-pet-max":14.5,"weight-range-show-min":1.8,"weight-range-show-max":13.6,"height-range-min":13.0,"height-range-max":28.0,"life-span-range-min":12.0,"life-span-range-max":16.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":null,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":null,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":null},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3d5e9b34-7b8f-565f-b2eb-6d2d0d84fb93/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3d5e9b34-7b8f-565f-b2eb-6d2d0d84fb93/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3d5e9b34-7b8f-565f-b2eb-6d2d0d84fb93/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3d5e9b34-7b8f-565f-b2eb-6d2d0d84fb93/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3d5e9b34-7b8f-565f-b2eb-6d2d0d84fb93/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3d5e9b34-7b8f-565f-b2eb-6d2d0d84fb93/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3d5e9b34-7b8f-565f-b2eb-6d2d0d84fb93/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3d5e9b34-7b8f-565f-b2eb-6d2d0d84fb93/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3d5e9b34-7b8f-565f-b2eb-6d2d0d84fb93/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3d5e9b34-7b8f-565f-b2eb-6d2d0d84fb93/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3d5e9b34-7b8f-565f-b2eb-6d2d0d84fb93/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3d5e9b34-7b8f-565f-b2eb-6d2d0d84fb93/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3d5e9b34-7b8f-565f-b2eb-6d2d0d84fb93/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3d5e9b34-7b8f-565f-b2eb-6d2d0d84fb93/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3d5e9b34-7b8f-565f-b2eb-6d2d0d84fb93/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3d5e9b34-7b8f-565f-b2eb-6d2d0d84fb93/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3d5e9b34-7b8f-565f-b2eb-6d2d0d84fb93/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3d5e9b34-7b8f-565f-b2eb-6d2d0d84fb93/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"3dad05f5-442a-5de6-9c00-e0e43634079d","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3dad05f5-442a-5de6-9c00-e0e43634079d"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"dogue-de-bordeaux","name":"Dogue de Bordeaux","plural-name":"Dogues de Bordeaux","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"An ancient French breed, the Dogue de Bordeaux was originally bred in the 12th century to be a hunting dog. Over the years, it's also been used for guarding, herding, animal-baiting, and dogfighting.\n\nInitially, there were three types of Dogues: Toulousain, Parisian, and Bordelais. The last of these is the ancestor of today's Dogue De Bordeaux. The breed's exact origins are unclear. A host of breeds—including various Mastiff- and Molossus-type guard dogs—likely contributed to the Dogue de Bordeaux as we know it today. In 1863, the breed officially earned its name after winning a competition in the first canine exhibition at the Jardin d'Acclimatation in Paris.\n\nThough the number of Dogue de Bordeauxs dropped significantly during the French Revolution and two World Wars, it ultimately survived. And by the early 1990s, the breed's popularity in America began to rise—likely due, in part, to the film Turner and Hooch. The movie starred Tom Hanks as Officer Turner and a Dogue de Bordeaux as the always slobbering (yet adorable) Hooch. The American Kennel Club formally recognized the breed in 2008.","facts":"Dogue de Bordeauxs are intelligent and alert dogs. They bond closely with their people and are eager to please. This breed yearns for attention and companionship. So, if you're looking for a pup you can pamper with cuddles and kisses, the Dogue de Bordeaux might be right for you.","traits-appearance":"A powerful and muscular dog, the Dogue de Bordeaux is built like an athlete. The breed is strong, as well as relatively compact—ideal qualities for working dogs.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Dogue De Bordeaux's short coat comes in a range of fawns, from a pale fawn to a deep, reddish mahogany. White patches are also possible. A black or brown mask is a common trait in this breed, but even without a true mask, the muzzle may appear more reddish than the rest of the coat.","traits-physical":"The Dogue de Bordeaux has a huge head and neck, prominent jaw, alert eyes, and an endearingly wrinkled brow. This is also a brachycephalic (a.k.a. short-snout breed).","temperament":"Despite their considerable size, Dogue de Bordeauxs are friendly dogs with a warm, teddy bear-like disposition. They're remarkably calm with family and children. That being said, you should always supervise your dog when kids are around.\n\nThe Dogue de Bordeaux's personality ranges from a little distant to uninhibited, or even downright entertaining. Serious and self-assured with strangers, this breed is courageous enough to take action if something's gone awry—often barking to alert their owner.","care-nutrition":"Dogue de Bordeauxs require a high-quality dog food that is age-appropriate. Be sure to keep an eye on the amount of food you give your Dogue de Bordeaux, and reduce portions if your pup gains weight. Also, remember that treats add up and, in excess quantities, can contribute to obesity.","care-grooming":"The Dogue de Bordeaux is an exceptional drooler. So, the dog's wrinkled face requires weekly (and sometimes daily) care to keep it clean and dry. Though short, this breed's coat sheds throughout the year. Regular brushing with a rubber curry or shedding blade can help keep loose hair under control.\n\nAs most dogs do, Dogue de Bordeauxs need their ears checked for debris or signs of infection, and nails trimmed about once a month. Similarly, one bath per month is usually sufficient unless your pup gets into something that makes them particularly dirty.","care-exercise":"To prevent developmental problems, you shouldn't allow your Dogue de Bordeaux to engage in excessive or high-impact exercise until at least 18 months old. So, no running up and down stairs or jumping from high surfaces. That being said, physical activity is important. Walks and playtime in the backyard are good options.\n\nWhen they reach adulthood, Dogue de Bordeauxs may enjoy a range of dog sports. These could include agility, carting, rally and competitive obedience, weight pull, water rescue, and tracking.","care-training":"Because Dogue de Bordeauxs have historically been used to guard people and property, they require dedicated obedience training and [early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) to be well-mannered companions.\n\nSometimes described as stubborn, Dogue de Bordeauxs are sensitive dogs that may resist rough or forceful disciplinary measures. But they do respond well to [reward-based techniques](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-obedience-training).","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/dogue-de-bordeaux/","reviewed-by":"Annette Louviere,

Shorthair","plural-name":null,"published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"cat","history":"American Shorthairs made a name for themselves as hardy, working-class cats. They accompanied settlers traveling from Europe to North America and were responsible for hunting rats on the ships. Historical records show that some of these cats even set sail on the Mayflower in 1620.\n\nPioneers instantly adored American Shorthairs for their hunting prowess. But it wasn't until the late 19th century that people started to appreciate their beautiful and varied coats. Around this time, breeders decided to develop and show a shorthair that looked like the working cats that had been in North American for centuries. The Cat Fancier Association (CFA) recognized the breed (then known as the Domestic Shorthair) as one of its inaugural breeds in 1906.\n\nBreeders then used the best specimens of the widely varied Domestic Shorthair to develop a breed with a specific set of traits. The CFA changed the breed name to American Shorthair in 1966—distinguishing these purebred cats from the many random-bred cats found on the streets.\n\nToday, the American Shorthair is among the most popular cat breeds.","facts":"American Shorthairs make excellent all-around pets. They're playful, intelligent, sweet-natured cats that fit right into any family. And if you have a mouse problem you'd like taken care of, the American has you covered.","traits-appearance":"The American Shorthair is a medium-sized, strong breed. These well-balanced and symmetrical cats have a body type that suggests power and agility.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"As you might imagine, American Shorthairs have short, hard-textured coats. The coat's thickness can vary based on region and season but is always dense enough to provide some protection from moisture and cold.\n\nThe American's coat comes in more than 80 different colors and patterns—including silver tabby, bi-color, calico, and tortoiseshell.","traits-physical":"The American has a large head and a full-cheeked face with a sweet expression. Their eyes are large and alert, with upper lids shaped like half almonds. A strong neck, well-developed chest, and muscular legs add to their overall athletic appearance. Their tails are medium-long and thick at the base, tapering to a blunt end.","temperament":"American Shorthairs are a playful, adaptable breed well suited to everything from quiet apartments to busy households. They're typically patient with kids and get along with dogs and other pets, making them an excellent breed for families.\n\nIn general, Americans are independent cats that can keep themselves entertained. They enjoy following their humans from room to room but aren't too demanding of their attention. Though males and females are both good-natured, the guys tend to be the most easygoing.\n\nTrue to their working cat backgrounds, Americans are hardy, athletic cats. Since their hunting instincts remain strong, they do their part to keep the house free of rodents and insects.","care-nutrition":"American Shorthairs require a high-quality diet. Because nutritional needs vary for kittens, adults, and senior cats, be sure to choose an age-appropriate formula.\n\nTo help your cat maintain a healthy body weight, monitor food intake and reduce their portions if they start to gain extra pounds. Also, keep an eye on the number of treats you give them. Calories can add up fast for cats of this size. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of their daily calories.\n\nIn addition to their daily meals, ensure your cat has access to fresh, clean water at all times.","care-grooming":"American Shorthairs are excellent self-groomers. Still, their thick coats need weekly brushing to look their best. Regular nail clipping is also required, as nails that get too long are more likely to snag on something and become torn or damaged. Overgrown nails may also grow into your cat's paw pads, leading to pain or infection. A scratching post can help keep their nails in good shape and satisfy their instinct to scratch.\n\nDental hygiene is an essential part of every cat's overall care.

Owner Nina Ennismore took the cat (named Kallibunker) to the veterinarian, who immediately knew Kalli was special.\n\nAt the vet's urging, Ennismore contacted British geneticist A.C. Jude. Hoping to produce more curly-coated kittens, Dr. Jude suggested Ennismore breed Kallibunker back to his mother. The resulting litter had two more curly kittens. Further outbreeding breeding confirmed that the gene mutation that produced the curly coat—known as the Rex mutation—was recessive.\n\nInterest in the Cornish Rex took off in 1956 when Life magazine published an article about Kallibunker and one of his kittens. The following year, a breeder in California imported two Cornish cats. The male was sterile, but the female (who was bred to her father before being exported) gave birth to two curly cats. Those cats became the foundation for the Cornish Rex breed in North America.\n\nTo expand and strengthen the gene pool, breeders in the United States crossed the Cornish Rex with Siamese, Havana Browns, American Shorthairs, and Burmese. The CFA began registering the breed in 1962 and granted it Champion status two years later.","facts":"Cornish Rex are active, people-oriented cats with outgoing, playful personalities. A happy Cornish is one that's curled up next to (or, better yet, on) their favorite human.","traits-appearance":"Cornish Rex are medium-sized cats with soft, wavy coats that make them resemble small lambs. They have strong muscle tone and a graceful, slender appearance.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Cornish's coat is short, velvety, and relatively dense. It lies close to the body and has a uniform marcel wave that's most prominent on the back and sides. The hair on the chin, chest, and stomach is shorter and noticeably wavy. All coat color and pattern combinations are possible in this breed.","traits-physical":"The Cornish Rex's unique look starts with a small, egg-shaped head, Roman nose, and enormous, erect ears. The breed's oval eyes are medium-to-large and slant slightly upward. Cornish Rex also have long, slender bodies and naturally arched backs. Other features include well-muscled but slim legs, a long thin tail, and dainty paws.","temperament":"Cornish Rex thrive on social interactions. As such, they need to be in the thick of the action and surrounded by other pets or people. Their outgoing, enthusiastic nature makes them an excellent fit for busy families with kids. But their need for attention can sometimes make them demanding, and they don't do well when left alone for long periods.\n\nThese energetic cats keep their kitten-like playfulness their whole lives. They can turn any object into a toy, and their fetch skills would make many dogs jealous. Best of all, their goofy personality and acrobatic moves keep their humans entertained for hours.\n\nDespite their active nature, Cornish make fantastic lap cats that love to cuddle with their humans.","care-nutrition":"Cornish Rex require a high-quality diet. Because nutritional needs vary for kittens, adults, and senior cats, opt for a formula that's age-appropriate for your pet.\n\nCornish love to eat. Left to their own devices, they would happily gobble up all food in sight (including any human food left unattended). To help your cat maintain a healthy weight, monitor their food intake closely. And don't forget to account for treats in their daily calorie totals. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of a cat's calories.\n\nBesides regular meals, access to fresh, clean water is essential for any cat.","care-grooming":"The Cornish's short, low-maintenance coat sheds minimally. As a result, people who typically experience cat allergies sometimes report milder symptoms when around a Cornish. Because of this, you might assume they are hypoallergenic. But the breed still produces the allergens that can trigger an allergic reaction.\n\nCornish's ears require regular cleaning to remove dirt and wax build-up. Monthly nail clipping is also a must. Nails that get too long are more likely to snag on something and become torn or damaged. Overgrown nails can also grow into your cat's paw pads, leading to pain or infection. In addition to clipping, providing a scratching post will help keep their nails in good shape and satisfy their instinct to scratch.\n\nFinally, Cornish should follow a dental care routine that includes at-home teeth brushing and professional dental exams and cleanings.","care-exercise":null,"care-training":null,"care-health":"Roughly one out of every three cats in the United States is overweight or obese.

The dogs historically protected sheep and goats from predators like wolves and bears in their native regions of Abruzzi and Maremma, Italy.\n\nOriginally separate breeds, the Pastore Abruzzese (shepherd dog of the Abruzzi) and Pastore Maremmano (shepherd dog of the Maremma) crossbred while moving flocks seasonally. The Ente Nazionale della Cinofilia Italiano (the Italian National Dog Association) unified them into a single breed in 1958.\n\nThe first Maremma Sheepdogs came to the United States in the 1970s as part of a ten-year research project exploring the effectiveness of livestock guardians. Throughout the study, researchers placed more than 1,000 dogs in 37 states; the results showed that their presence led to decreases in livestock predation.\n\nMaremma Sheepdogs have contributed to a resurgence in the traditional practice of using livestock guardian dogs for flock protection.","facts":"The Maremma Sheepdog is a livestock guardian with strong protective instincts and loyalty to its family.","traits-appearance":"The Maremma Sheepdog is a strong, muscular dog with a rustic appearance. They have a lively, attentive expression and move with an extended trot.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Maremma Sheepdogs are a double-coated breed. Their undercoats are only abundant in the winter, while their outercoats consist of long hair that can grow up to three inches. The hair on their outercoats is harsh to the touch, straight, and lies flat on their bodies.\n\nTheir coats include plenty of hair around the neck and fringes on the hindquarters; the hair is shorter on the muzzle, skull, ears, and front of the limbs.\n\nMaremma Sheepdogs are typically white, though their coat can be shades of ivory, lemon, or pale orange. Those colors are tolerated but not preferred according to the breed standard.","traits-physical":"Maremma Sheepdogs are large, solidly-built dogs with deep, rounded chests, muscular loins and thighs, and thick necks. Their tails are well furnished, set low, and are carried level with the back when the dogs are excited.\n\nMaremma Sheepdogs have large noses with wide nostrils, hanging but mobile V-shaped ears, and almond-shaped eyes with black rims that convey a lively and attentive expression.","temperament":"Traits like intelligence, alertness, courage, and attentiveness are among the top reasons Maremma Sheepdogs make excellent guardians. Maremma Sheepdogs are devoted to their owners and do best in homes where they can both work and join in family activities.\n\nThe breed is also affectionate and devoted to its owners. Maremma Sheepdogs will use their size and loud voice as deterrents, which can make them ill-suited to apartment life.\n\nLike all good guardians, Maremma Sheepdogs can be wary of strangers. Regular [socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) can help them become more comfortable with unfamiliar people.","care-nutrition":"Feed Maremma Sheepdogs a high-quality dog food that is appropriate for their life stage (puppy, adult, senior). Portion out their food with a standard measuring cup and limit treats to no more than 10 percent of their daily calories to avoid overfeeding.","care-grooming":"Although Maremma Sheepdogs have thick hair, the breed does not require extensive grooming. Brush their coats at least once per week to prevent matting.\n\nDaily brushing during “shedding season” in spring and fall is essential to remove all of the dead hair. Maremma Sheepdogs only need baths if they get into something messy.\n\nClean their ears and trim their nails to prevent cracking, splitting, and painful overgrowths. Regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) that includes at-home teeth brushing and professional cleanings is also an essential part of their grooming routines.","care-exercise":"Maremma Sheepdogs are working dogs and require a lot of exercise. These smart, active dogs enjoy hiking, running, and swimming and may do well in dog sports like agility, tracking, herding, and obedience.\n\nIn addition to high-intensity physical activity, provide mental stimulation with hide-and-seek, puzzle toys, or other interactive games.","care-training":"Maremma Sheepdogs require consistent training from a young age to help them grow into well-mannered dogs.\n\nThe smart, eager-to-please Maremma Sheepdog requires positive reinforcement and rewards, not harsh training techniques, to master basic commands and learn new tricks. Remember to pack your patience!\n\n[Early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) is essential to help these dogs temper their guarding instincts and feel more comfortable with strangers.","care-health":null,"references":"http://fci.be/Nomenclature/Standards/201g01-en.pdf\n\nhttp://www.maremmaclub.com/history.html","reviewed-by":"Cindy Elston, DVM, MPH","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":29.9,"weight-range-pet-max":45.4,"weight-range-show-min":29.9,"weight-range-show-max":44.9,"height-range-min":58.0,"height-range-max":74.0,"life-span-range-min":10.0,"life-span-range-max":14.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":85,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":54,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":39},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3f880778-4107-5dcd-b841-6ff61f5aa523/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3f880778-4107-5dcd-b841-6ff61f5aa523/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3f880778-4107-5dcd-b841-6ff61f5aa523/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3f880778-4107-5dcd-b841-6ff61f5aa523/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3f880778-4107-5dcd-b841-6ff61f5aa523/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3f880778-4107-5dcd-b841-6ff61f5aa523/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3f880778-4107-5dcd-b841-6ff61f5aa523/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3f880778-4107-5dcd-b841-6ff61f5aa523/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3f880778-4107-5dcd-b841-6ff61f5aa523/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3f880778-4107-5dcd-b841-6ff61f5aa523/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3f880778-4107-5dcd-b841-6ff61f5aa523/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3f880778-4107-5dcd-b841-6ff61f5aa523/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3f880778-4107-5dcd-b841-6ff61f5aa523/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3f880778-4107-5dcd-b841-6ff61f5aa523/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3f880778-4107-5dcd-b841-6ff61f5aa523/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3f880778-4107-5dcd-b841-6ff61f5aa523/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3f880778-4107-5dcd-b841-6ff61f5aa523/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/3f880778-4107-5dcd-b841-6ff61f5aa523/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"408565f4-a3e9-55b8-8fd7-1739b52451f5","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/408565f4-a3e9-55b8-8fd7-1739b52451f5"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"korat","name":"Korat","plural-name":null,"published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"cat","history":"The Korat originated in Ampur Pimai, Thailand (formerly Siam). The first known reference to the breed appears in the ancient manuscript **The Cat Book of Poems**. Written during the Ayudhya Period of Siamese History (1350-1767), the book lists the Korat as one of 17 \"good luck\" cat breeds. As such, people often gave Korats to brides as wedding gifts.\n\nRecords indicate that a Korat—listed as a Siamese—appeared in a cat show in London in 1896. However, judges disqualified this silver-blue cat for having a color outside the Siamese breed standard.\n\nKorats made their entrance in the United States in 1959 when a cattery in Oregon imported a brother and sister pair. Many more Korats followed, and in 1966, the CFA granted the breed Championship status.\n\nBut today, Korats are a rare breed, even in Thailand.","facts":"Korats are intelligent, energetic, charming cats that show great loyalty to their humans. In their native Thailand, they're symbols of good fortune. And anyone who shares a home with these affectionate cats is lucky indeed.","traits-appearance":"Korats are medium-sized cats with compact, muscular bodies and smooth curves. They have shimmering coats, expressive eyes, and an alert appearance.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Silver-tipped blue hairs give the Korat's coat a unique halo effect. Each strand is lighter at the root, transitioning to a deeper blue up the shaft before turning silver at the tip. The coat is short and close-lying, with a fine texture and glossy sheen.","traits-physical":"Korats are the only cat breed with a heart-shaped head. Their eyebrows form the heart's top curves, and the sides of their face curve down to complete the shape. The breed's ears are large, with a flare at the base and a rounded tip. Korats' large, luminous eyes come in green or amber.","temperament":"These cats give their unconditional love and respect to their humans—and expect the same in return. Korats form close bonds with their family and are very expressive and affectionate. Because they thrive on companionship, they don't like to be left alone for long periods and may become withdrawn.\n\nThis fun-loving breed enjoys racing around the house, fetching objects, or pouncing on feather toys. Despite being so energetic, they're gentle with kids. Though they do get along with other pets, Korats can be bossy in making sure all other furry friends understand they call the shots.\n\nThese intelligent cats are skilled problem solvers. They often open doors or cabinets to get a look at what's on the other side. And they love to climb to high places to get a bird's eye view of what's going on around them.\n\nMore than anything, Korats want to be at the side (or on top) of their favorite people. They are champion cuddlers and loyal friends that are generally long-lived, with some living into their 20s.","care-nutrition":"Korats require a quality diet. Because nutritional needs vary for kittens, adults, and senior cats, opt for a formula that's age-appropriate for your pet.\n\nTo keep your cat at a healthy weight, measure out meals and reduce portions if necessary. And don't forget to account for treats. As a guideline, they should make up no more than 10% of a cat's calories.\n\nLastly, all cats need access to fresh, clean water around the clock.","care-grooming":"The short, single coat of the Korat is easy to maintain. Weekly brushing is all that's needed to remove dirt and loose fur.\n\nMost cats' nails require monthly trimming to prevent them from getting too long. Long nails are more likely to snag on something and become torn or damaged. They can even grow into your cat's paw pads, leading to pain or infection. In addition to clipping, providing a scratching post will allow your cat to do some nail maintenance themselves (thanks to their instinct to scratch).\n\nGood dental hygiene is essential to a Korat's overall health.

Hunters developed the breed at the beginning of the 20th century by crossing Swiss Hounds with Basset Hounds. This new shorter breed was better able to hunt in enclosed grounds called shoots.\n\nLike the original Swiss Hound, the Small Swiss Hound comes in four color varieties and has the same melodious howl. The first breed club formed in 1905, and United Kennel Club recognized the breed in 2006.","facts":"With an acute sense of smell and passion for trailing prey, the Small Swiss Hound is an outstanding hunting dog. This affectionate, lively breed also makes a great companion for people who can provide consistent training and plenty of exercise.","traits-appearance":"The Small Swiss Hound is a small, rectangular-shaped dog with a noble head and alert expression.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Small Swiss Hounds have a short, dense coat that is usually smooth—though the Bernese variety can have a rough coat. Though all varieties have very fine hair on the head and ears, they differ in coat color.\n\nThe Bernese variety is white with black patches and tan markings around the face. Jura Small Swiss Hounds are tan with a black blanket and black or tan markings on the face. Lucernes are \"blue,\" with a combination of black and white hairs and heavy speckling, black patches or saddle, and tan markings on the face. And Schwyz Small Swiss Hounds are white with orange patches or saddle.","traits-physical":"Small Swiss Hounds have long, narrow heads that widen around the eyes—which are oval-shaped and friendly. Like many hounds, these dogs have long, low-set pendulous ears. And their medium-length tails curve slightly upward.","temperament":"When hunting, Small Swiss Hounds are energetic working dogs. But at home, these little pups make affectionate companions.\n\nDespite their size, Small Swiss Hounds have big personalities and lively dispositions. Usually friendly with people, these calm and playful dogs are a good fit for active families that can put in the time to exercise them adequately. However, if they get bored, they may become destructive or engage in other undesirable behaviors.\n\nBecause of their hunting and tracking instincts, Small Swiss Hounds aren't typically good with small animals. When they see a little animal, their desire to chase takes over. Small Swiss Hounds can also be very vocal. Their melodious singing can be entertaining, but may not make them an ideal fit for apartment living.","care-nutrition":"Small Swiss Hounds do best on a diet formulated for their activity level, breed size, and life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior).\n\nMonitor their food intake to keep them from eating too many calories. And don't forget to account for treats. Even a couple of extra snacks can cause a little dog like the Small Swiss Hound to gain weight. As a rule, treats should make up no more than 10% of their calories.","care-grooming":"Small Swiss Hounds have short hair that is relatively easy to maintain. Regularly brushing to remove loose hair and dirt is typically all that's needed to keep their coats looking and feeling their best.\n\nBecause of their long ears, Small Swiss Hounds may be more prone to ear infections. Check their ears regularly for dirt or wax build-up, and clean them as needed. Nail trims and dental care—including at-home teeth brushing and professional dental cleanings—should also be part of their routine care.","care-exercise":"Small Swiss Hounds are active working dogs that require daily physical and mental exercise. These happy dogs love playtime with their humans, as well as long walks and hikes. They also enjoy tracking and nose work competitions that allow them to show off their excellent sense of smell.","care-training":"Hardworking and intelligent, Small Swiss Hounds are typically easy to train. They respond best to positive reinforcement. So, try using treats or a favorite toy to reward desired behaviors.\n\nBecause Small Swiss Hounds have a strong prey drive, early socialization is critical. Introducing your puppy to different people, places, and pets will help them develop into a well-adjusted adult dog.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.eukanuba.co.uk/breeds/small-swiss-hound-(schwizerischer-niederlaufhund)\n\nhttps://www.ukcdogs.com/small-swiss-hound\n","reviewed-by":"Annette Louviere, DVM","date-reviewed":"2020-09-05T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":8.2,"weight-range-pet-max":15.0,"weight-range-show-min":8.2,"weight-range-show-max":15.0,"height-range-min":41.0,"height-range-max":46.0,"life-span-range-min":10.0,"life-span-range-max":12.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":null,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":null,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":null},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/40a83bfe-c0f9-5fe2-9f06-3adf555f8f6d/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/40a83bfe-c0f9-5fe2-9f06-3adf555f8f6d/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/40a83bfe-c0f9-5fe2-9f06-3adf555f8f6d/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/40a83bfe-c0f9-5fe2-9f06-3adf555f8f6d/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/40a83bfe-c0f9-5fe2-9f06-3adf555f8f6d/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/40a83bfe-c0f9-5fe2-9f06-3adf555f8f6d/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/40a83bfe-c0f9-5fe2-9f06-3adf555f8f6d/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/40a83bfe-c0f9-5fe2-9f06-3adf555f8f6d/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/40a83bfe-c0f9-5fe2-9f06-3adf555f8f6d/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/40a83bfe-c0f9-5fe2-9f06-3adf555f8f6d/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/40a83bfe-c0f9-5fe2-9f06-3adf555f8f6d/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/40a83bfe-c0f9-5fe2-9f06-3adf555f8f6d/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/40a83bfe-c0f9-5fe2-9f06-3adf555f8f6d/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/40a83bfe-c0f9-5fe2-9f06-3adf555f8f6d/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/40a83bfe-c0f9-5fe2-9f06-3adf555f8f6d/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/40a83bfe-c0f9-5fe2-9f06-3adf555f8f6d/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/40a83bfe-c0f9-5fe2-9f06-3adf555f8f6d/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/40a83bfe-c0f9-5fe2-9f06-3adf555f8f6d/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"40fb8ed7-fc0d-52cc-81e7-c0c91ac3f67e","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/40fb8ed7-fc0d-52cc-81e7-c0c91ac3f67e"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"swedish-elkhound","name":"Swedish Elkhound (Jämthund)","plural-name":"Swedish Elkhounds","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"Known as the Jämthund, this Elkhound was named after the Jamtland region in Sweden. An ancient Spitz-type breed, the Swedish Elkhound is larger than many of the other related Elkhound breeds—such as the Norwegian.\n\nBred initially to hunt big game and serve as a working dog, the Swedish Elkhound was prized for its strength, endurance, and ability to withstand harsh Arctic conditions.\n\nThe Swedish Elkhound was recognized as a breed in 1946, moving it out from under the title of Norwegian Elkhound. However, the Northern Breed Group of the United Kennel Club didn't accept it until 2006.","facts":"Swedish Elkhounds are intelligent, independent, and alert dogs with a reputation of being loyal to family. Traditionally used in hunting, Swedish Elkhounds have a high prey drive, independent nature, and boundless energy. That means the breed needs plenty of room to run and lots of opportunities to do so.","traits-appearance":"The Swedish Elkhound has a rectangular body, long and broad head, wide muzzle, and dark, expressive eyes.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The thick double coat of the Swedish Elkhound can be light or dark gray. This breed also often wears a white facial mask and white markings on the body.","traits-physical":"A noticeable characteristic of the Swedish Elkhound is a tail that loosely curls over the back.","temperament":"Swedish Elkhounds were bred to hunt elk and other large game. They can be stubborn and overbearing with other dogs, but they show a calm and affectionate side with their family. Swedish Elkhounds also tend to have harmonious relationships with children due to their protective nature.\n\nA patient breed, the Swedish Elkhound doesn't get annoyed easily, making it a stable companion while on a hunt or at home.","care-nutrition":"The Swedish Elkhound requires a high-quality dog food formulated for its medium size and high-energy needs.","care-grooming":"The Swedish Elkhound's coat is relatively long. Brushing every few days can help remove dead hair and keep it in tip-top condition. Bathing is rarely necessary unless your dog gets into something messy.","care-exercise":"Swedish Elkhounds are quick, agile dogs. They require regular exercise to stay mentally and physically fit—as most hunting breeds do. The Swedish Elkhound's remarkable stamina allows it to work for long periods in all kinds of weather.\n\nTo satisfy their mental and physical stimulation needs, aim to provide moderate to vigorous activity for a half-hour every day. If your pup will be playing outside at home, a fenced-in yard is a must. And if you're out running or hiking together, be sure to use a leash.\n\nTake note that Swedish Elkhounds will likely become quickly bored if kept inside for long periods. And if that happens, they may entertain themselves with destructive behavior.","care-training":"The Swedish Elkhound is eager to please and generally responds well to training. They love having a job to do and are quick to learn. [Reward-based training](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-obedience-training) is most effective.\n\n[Early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) can prevent your Swedish Elkhound from being reactive toward other dogs and overly protective around strangers. And consistent, determined training will help curb natural instincts that may conflict with family life.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.ukcdogs.com/swedish-elkhound\n\nhttps://www.google.com/books/edition/Simon_Schuster_s_Guide_to_Dogs/ewP7tH1eaXMC","reviewed-by":"Annette Louviere,

Welsh Corgi","plural-name":"Pembroke Welsh Corgis","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"Pembroke Welsh Corgis are tenacious little herding dogs whose origins date back to 1107 A.D. Though named for Pembrokeshire, Wales—where the breed originated—their earliest ancestors were from the same spitz-type family as the [Keeshond](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/keeshond), [Pomeranian](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/pomeranian), [Finnish Spitz](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/finnish-spitz), and [Norwegian Elkhound](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/norwegian-elkhound). Flemish weavers who emigrated to Wales brought their herding dogs that served as the foundation for this short-legged herding breed.\n\nAlthough Pembroke Welsh Corgis often intermingled with [Cardigan Welsh Corgis](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/cardigan-welsh-corgi), the two breeds have been distinct since the late 1800s. The Pembroke Welsh Corgi is the more popular of the breeds.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II helped to popularize the breed. Her Majesty got her first Pembroke Welsh Corgi in 1933 and has been a devoted Pembroke owner ever since.","facts":"Pembroke Welsh Corgis are strong, athletic working dogs. Though small in stature, the breed tackles the big task of herding cattle. Their skill has made them one of the world's most popular herding breeds.","traits-appearance":"The Pembroke Welsh Corgi is a low set, strong, active dog that moves with a smooth, free gait and intelligent expression.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"This double-coated breed has a short, thick, weather-resistant undercoat and a longer, coarse outer coat that lies flat. While the overall length of their coats varies, Pembroke Welsh Corgis have longer hair around their necks, chests, and shoulders (creating a ruff) and on the back of their forelegs and underparts.\n\n\"Fluffies\" have coats that are extreme in length with exaggerated feathering on the ears, chest, legs, feet, underparts, and hindquarters. Though adorable, this is considered a serious fault according to the breed standard.\n\nPembroke Welsh Corgis come in several colors, including red, sable, fawn, black, and tan with or without white markings. The breed standard allows for white markings on the legs, chest, neck, muzzle, underparts, and as a narrow blaze on the head. \"Whitelies,\" a white coloring with red or dark markings, and \"Bluies,\" portions of the coat with distinct bluish or smoky casts, are considered serious faults.","traits-physical":"Pembroke Welsh Corgis are low-set dogs that are much longer than tall. These dogs have firm and level toplines; deep chests; short forearms; and strong, flexible hindquarters. Pembroke Welsh Corgis have firm, erect ears that taper to a slightly rounded point, and oval, medium-sized eyes that convey an intelligent, interested expression.","temperament":"Pembroke Welsh Corgis are active, alert, intelligent dogs. Despite having short legs, these dogs are quick and agile. Their origins as cattle herders have also made the breed fearless and independent. Pembroke Welsh Corgis love to work and love their families. These dogs are loyal pets who make excellent companions.\n\nPembroke Welsh Corgis also have a reputation as good watchdogs. These small dogs have a big bark and will alert their owners to strangers or unfamiliar sounds.","care-nutrition":"Feed Pembroke Welsh Corgis a high-quality dog food that is appropriate for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). This breed may easily become overweight. In addition to other health concerns, weight strains their long backs, potentially leading to disc problems. To avoid overfeeding, portion out their food with a measuring cup and limit treats to no more than 10% of their daily calories.","care-grooming":"Pembroke Welsh Corgis have waterproof double coats that require regular grooming. Brush them at least once per week to remove loose hair and prevent shedding. During seasonal shedding periods in the spring and summer, regular baths and daily brushing with an undercoat rake will help loosen excess hair. Keep their ears clean, and their nails trimmed.\n\nPembroke Welsh Corgis benefit from a regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) routine that includes at-home teeth-brushing and professional cleanings.","care-exercise":"These small dogs have big exercise needs. Pembroke Welsh Corgis are working dogs that are happiest with a job to do. If they are not herding cattle or sheep, this high-energy breed enjoys long walks, hikes, and trips to the dog park. Due to their short legs and bulky bodies, Pembroke Welsh Corgis are not great swimmers and cannot keep up on a bicycle ride. Their long bodies put them at risk of back injuries, so it's important to avoid activities that require a lot of jumping or stairs. They don't appreciate extreme temperatures and should not spend too much time outdoors in extreme heat or cold.\n\nThese highly intelligent dogs also excel at agility, obedience, rally, tracking, and herding. Mental stimulation is important, too. Puzzle toys and other games are helpful ways to keep their minds engaged.","care-training":"Pembroke Welsh Corgis are intelligent but have a stubborn streak. Consistent training that focuses on positive reinforcement and rewards will help them master basic commands and learn new tasks. These are sensitive dogs, so avoid harsh training methods. Pembroke Welsh Corgis love spending time with their owners and will see training as a bonding experience.\n\n[Socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) is essential for this breed. Starting when they are puppies, introduce them to activities that allow them to engage with others. Even if it's interacting with the neighbors on a walk around the block, it will help nurture their need to engage with a wide range of people, pets, and places. Provide regular socialization throughout their lifetimes.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/pembroke-welsh-corgi/\n\nhttp://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/PembrokeWelshCorgi.pdf","reviewed-by":"Annette Louviere, DVM","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":8.2,"weight-range-pet-max":19.1,"weight-range-show-min":10.0,"weight-range-show-max":15.0,"height-range-min":25.0,"height-range-max":30.0,"life-span-range-min":10.0,"life-span-range-max":15.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":96,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":59,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":40},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/41985ef9-6cce-5734-b08d-b6ae75ca4227/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/41985ef9-6cce-5734-b08d-b6ae75ca4227/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/41985ef9-6cce-5734-b08d-b6ae75ca4227/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/41985ef9-6cce-5734-b08d-b6ae75ca4227/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/41985ef9-6cce-5734-b08d-b6ae75ca4227/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/41985ef9-6cce-5734-b08d-b6ae75ca4227/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/41985ef9-6cce-5734-b08d-b6ae75ca4227/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/41985ef9-6cce-5734-b08d-b6ae75ca4227/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/41985ef9-6cce-5734-b08d-b6ae75ca4227/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/41985ef9-6cce-5734-b08d-b6ae75ca4227/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/41985ef9-6cce-5734-b08d-b6ae75ca4227/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/41985ef9-6cce-5734-b08d-b6ae75ca4227/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/41985ef9-6cce-5734-b08d-b6ae75ca4227/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/41985ef9-6cce-5734-b08d-b6ae75ca4227/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/41985ef9-6cce-5734-b08d-b6ae75ca4227/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/41985ef9-6cce-5734-b08d-b6ae75ca4227/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/41985ef9-6cce-5734-b08d-b6ae75ca4227/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/41985ef9-6cce-5734-b08d-b6ae75ca4227/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"41a780b5-2a6e-5a16-a276-d7438a3d59e6","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/41a780b5-2a6e-5a16-a276-d7438a3d59e6"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"savannah","name":"Savannah","plural-name":null,"published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"cat","history":"The Savannah is a cross between an African Serval and a Domestic cat. The first known hybrid of this type was born on April 7, 1986, and had the characteristics of both a domesticated cat and a wild Serval. Breeder Suzi Wood named the kitten—and this new breed—Savannah.\n\nWood didn't know if she could breed this first-generation hybrid cross (known as an F1) back to a Domestic cat. But her attempt was successful, and Savannah gave birth to a litter of second-generation hybrids (F2s).\n\nMeanwhile, breeder Patrick Kelley had set his sights on creating a domestic cat with a spotted, wildcat appearance. After hearing about Wood's efforts, he contacted her and purchased the one female kitten Savannah had produced. He bred that kitten back to another Domestic, resulting in the first third-generation (F3) Savannah. Kelley convinced another breeder, Joyce Sroufe, to join his pursuit of this new breed. Together, they wrote the original breed standard for the Savannah.\n\nThe International Cat Association accepted the Savannah in 2001 and granted it Championship status in 2012. Though the breed is still in its infancy, it's gaining acceptance from breeders and attention from people drawn to these cats' exotic appearance and adventurous personalities.","facts":"Savannahs are striking in both appearance and personality. Their relentless energy, curious nature, and \"up for anything\" attitude make these cats an excellent fit for active households looking to add an entertaining friend.","traits-appearance":"Savannahs are tall cats with long bodies and slender necks. They can range in weight, but the older generations (F1s and F2s) are typically the largest.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Savannah's short-to-medium coat is moderately dense and loose. Coarser top hairs cover the soft undercoat, and spots have a softer texture than ground hairs. This breed's coat comes in four colors: brown spotted tabby, silver spotted tabby, black, and black smoke.","traits-physical":"Savannahs have triangular heads that are small in proportion to their bodies. Their massive, upright ears sit high on the head and have rounded tips. A unique trait of the breed is their flat, hooded eyes that contribute to an exotic appearance. The Savannah's body and legs are long and muscular, and the tail is short and thick.","temperament":"Intelligent and high-energy, Savannahs require a lot of interaction and companionship. They do well in families with older children and get along with other cats and cat-friendly dogs. If their humans spend a lot of time away from home, they'll be happiest with a \"sibling\" pet to keep them company.\n\nThese curious kitties get bored quickly, and that can lead to mischief. But lots of exercise and entertainment can help keep them out of trouble. They love playing with interactive toys, learning tricks, walking on a leash, fetching, and even splashing around in the water.\n\nThe Savannah's signs of affection typically don't include curling up in a lap. But they often greet their favorite humans at the door, follow them from room to room, and headbutt them to display their love.","care-nutrition":"Savannahs are active cats that require a quality diet to meet their nutritional needs. Because those needs vary for kittens, adults, and senior cats, opt for a formula that's age-appropriate for your pet.\n\nEven though Savannahs are very active cats, they are still at risk for obesity if they overeat. So, monitor your pet's food intake and reduce their portions if they start to gain too much weight. And remember, treats should make up no more than 10% of their daily calories.\n\nIn addition to daily meals, access to fresh, clean water is essential to every cat's health.","care-grooming":"The Savannah's relatively short coat is easy to maintain. Occasional brushing with a steel comb is often all it takes to keep it looking its best. During seasonal shedding periods, your cat may need more frequent brushing.\n\nMonthly nail trimming should be another component of their regular care. Nails that get too long are more likely to snag on something and become torn or damaged. And overgrown nails can even grow into your cat's paw pads, leading to pain or infection. In addition to clipping, providing a scratching post will help keep their nails in good shape and satisfy their instinct to scratch.\n\nFinally, dental care is essential to a Savannah's lifelong health. From a young age, start yours on a dental routine that includes at-home teeth brushing and professional exams and cleanings.","care-exercise":null,"care-training":null,"care-health":"Savannahs have some history of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy, which decreases the heart's efficiency and can lead to other issues.

earlier records of a dog strikingly similar to the Brittany, experts believe this breed dates back to 1865. In an area of Brittany, France, referred to as Callac, the breed arose mostly as an accident.\n\nWhen British nobility visited France to shoot partridge and woodcock, they took their dogs with them. However, they couldn't bring their dogs back home due to quarantine laws. The abandoned dogs started breeding with local spaniels, creating the Brittany.\n\nBrittanys quickly grew popular when locals recognized they had a keen sense of smell, excellent tracking ability, and general aptitude for work.\n\nThe breed standard was established in 1907. The Brittany first came to the United States in 1931. And in 1934, the AKC recognized the Brittany Spaniel as a breed.\n\nBecause the U.S. dog's hunting style is more like a pointer than a spaniel, in 1982, the Brittany Spaniel became simply the Brittany. Today, this breed yields one of the most versatile bird dogs—highly capable, whether hunting duck, woodcock, pheasant, or partridge.","facts":"The Brittany is an intelligent, lively, gentle, and affectionate breed skilled in hunting and retrieving. Thanks to the breed's good temperament and desire to please, Brittany's make great pets for people looking for an active, energetic dog.","traits-appearance":"The Brittany is a compact, medium-sized dog with characteristic ruggedness. As a leggy breed, the Brittany is strong, agile, and quick.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Brittanys have dense coats that are flat or wavy but never curly. Their ears have a little fringe, and the front and hind legs have some feathering.\n\nBrittanys' coats come in either orange or liver with white. The white may be ticked. In liver-colored dogs with orange highlights, tricolors may exist. The Brittany never has any black in the coat. Thus, the nose is always liver.","traits-physical":"The Brittany's eyes are well set in the head. They have heavy, expressive eyebrows that protect them from briars while hunting. Brittanys' legs are so long that their height at their shoulders is the same as the length of their bodies. The breed has either no tail or one that's about four inches long.","temperament":"The Brittany is well-suited for an active, lively household. It's a happy, sweet-natured, energetic breed that's always up for an adventure.\n\nWhen [socialized from puppyhod](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization), Brittanys make excellent family pets. But even with proper socialization, they should be closely supervised around young kids. Their exuberance could lead to accidental injury. Brittanys typically get along great with pets and other dogs. And they are generally outgoing around strangers.\n\nBecause of their stamina and endless energy, Brittanys need above-average daily exercise—both physical and mental. But when they have a proper outlet for their energy, they tend to be calm, sweet-natured house dogs.","care-nutrition":"Brittanys need high-quality food that's appropriate for their specific life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). A diet formulated for medium-sized dogs is a great option to consider.\n\nTo keep their weight in a healthy range, closely monitor their food intake. Avoid accidental overfeeding by using a standard measuring cup to measure meals. And be sure to take treats into account. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of their daily calories.","care-grooming":"Twice-weekly brushing with a soft brush is typically enough to maintain a Brittany's stylish coat. You should check ears regularly and clean them if you find any debris or wax build-up.\n\nThough nails will be worn down during regular activity, it may not be enough to keep them at an ideal length. So, inspect nails frequently, and trim them as needed. Nails that get too long can lead to pain or issues with walking or running.\n\nAs all dogs do, Brittanys require regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care), including at-home teeth brushing and professional dental cleanings. Maintaining good dental hygiene is important for their overall long-term health. The sooner you get them into a good dental care routine, the better.","care-exercise":"Brittanys are tireless dogs that require significant exercise. True to their beginnings, hunting and retrieving are their favorite ways to burn off energy. But there are plenty of other activities that make them happy—especially when their favorite human is by their side.\n\nBrittanys enjoy dog sports such as agility, competitive obedience, field trials, and tracking events that take advantage of their keen sense of smell. They also like fast-paced walks and hikes, and they make great on-leash jogging buddies. Because they get along well with most dogs, they're also a great candidate for the dog park.","care-training":"Brittanys love to please and respond to instructions, so they are relatively easy to train. Because they have a sensitive nature, they respond well to motivational tools such as treats or favorite toys in a reward-based approach to training.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/brittany/\n\nhttps://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/dog-breeds/brittany\n\nhttp://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/Brittany.pdf\n\nhttps://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/dog-breeds/brittany","reviewed-by":"Laura

Street Dog","plural-name":"Nepalese Street Dogs","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"Thousands of years ago, a number of gray wolves became domesticated. Experts believe the Nepalese street dog is a direct descendant of those earliest \"dogs.\" Unlike purebred dogs that people have developed to strengthen certain traits, Nepalese street dogs don't belong to a particular breed. Instead, they have evolved on their own in their native environment.\n\nHindus believe the dog is the messenger of Yamaraj—the God of death. To appease Yamaraj, they worship dogs during the Nepalese Hindu festival of Tihar. On this \"Day of the Dogs,\" people bless and celebrate dogs and shower them with flowers and food. Despite this day of worship, many Nepalese street dogs live in unhealthy conditions and suffer inhumane treatment.\n\nToday, thousands of street dogs exist in Nepal, with an estimated 20,000 in Kathmandu alone. Local animal welfare organizations are working to find homes for dogs, provide veterinary care, and reduce the number of dogs on the street.","facts":"Nepalese street dogs are free-roaming pups that typically congregate in cities or towns with plentiful resources. They share many basic traits with pet dogs, but they lead primarily independent lives outdoors.","traits-appearance":"Nepalese street dogs can come in all shapes and sizes. However, street dogs generally tend to be medium-sized.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Though any combination of coat colors, patterns, and lengths is genetically possible, street dogs typically have short, brownish coats.","traits-physical":"Nepalese street dogs don't follow a breed standard—no shared set of traits links them together. Still, common characteristics of street dogs include prick ears and pointed noses.","temperament":"Street dogs must learn to fend for themselves. As a result, they tend to be scrappy, intelligent, and adaptable—all skills that support independent survival. Because they've never had to rely on humans, they may be fearful or skeptical of people who have not earned their trust.","care-nutrition":"A Nepalese street dog's diet typically consists of whatever they can kill or find—small farm animals, scraps from trash cans, handouts from kind strangers, and so on. If you're leaving food out for a street dog, they'll benefit from commercial diets formulated for pet dogs.\n\nBecause they fend for themselves, street dogs aren't usually at risk of becoming overweight. However, if you take a street dog under your roof, keep an eye on their food intake to avoid overfeeding. Guidelines on dog food packages are a good starting point when determining daily portions.","care-grooming":"If you've adopted a street dog that's comfortable being handled, regular brushing and nail trims will help them look their best. Good [dental hygiene](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) is also important for any dog. Professional cleanings and at-home dental care will keep their mouths healthy and reduce the risk of related health issues.","care-exercise":"All dogs need exercise to stay physically and mentally fit, and street dogs are no exception. Nepalese street dogs that are on their own will get adequate exercise during their daily roaming. Pet dogs, however, need access to the outdoors to stretch their legs and get mental stimulation. Playing in a fenced yard and going for leashed walks are great ways for your dog to release energy.","care-training":"Street dogs are not accustomed to obeying commands from people. In fact, many may avoid close contact with humans. Before attempting a training program, start by building trust and respect with your dog. Slow and steady is the best approach to making inroads with a street

Water Spaniel","plural-name":"Irish Water Spaniels","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The version of the Irish Water Spaniel we know today originated in Ireland in the 1830s. But many experts believe the breed has ancient roots. In fact, it may be the oldest (and largest) of all spaniel breeds.\n\nThe breed we know today began with a dog born in Dublin in 1834 named \"Boatswain.\" Though the exact origin of the Irish Water Spaniel is unknown, the breed may share a common lineage with the [Poodle](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/poodle-medium), [Portuguese Water Dog](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/portuguese-water-dog), and [Barbet](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/barbet).\n\nIrish Water Spaniels gained popularity in Britain for their ability to retrieve game from icy waters. They're ideally suited for this job thanks to their two-layered, water-repellent coat. Plus, this breed is an especially good swimmer because it has webbed feet and a hairless tail that acts like a rudder.\n\nThe Irish Spaniel earned many nicknames over the years, including Shannon Spaniels, Rat Tail Spaniels, Whiptail Spaniels, and Bog Dogs. After coming to North America in the mid-1800s, the Irish Water Spaniel received American Kennel Club recognition in 1878. Back in 1875, the Irish Water Spaniel was one of the most popular sporting dogs in Britain and the United States. But today it's much rarer.","facts":"The Irish Water Spaniel is an intelligent, playful, and eager-to-please breed. With their poofy topknots and boisterous personalities, Irish Water Spaniels are often considered the clowns of the spaniel family. But these humorous dogs are just as skilled at retrieving game as they are making their humans smile.","traits-appearance":"Irish Water Spaniels are sturdy, well-balanced gundogs easily identified by the poof of curls atop their heads and their smooth \"rat\" tails.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Irish Water Spaniel has a distinctive topknot of long, loose curls and a body covered with dense, tighter curls. The coat comes in a rich liver with a purplish tinge. This is known as puce liver—a distinctive color not seen in any other dog breed.","traits-physical":"The Irish Water Spaniel's expression is alert, intelligent, and quizzical. The breed's small, almond-shaped eyes are a warm dark brown or amber hue. Its long, lobular ears are covered with loose curls of hair.\n\nMost memorable is the Irish Water Spaniel's tail. Thick at the root, the first 2-3 inches are covered with short curls, which stop abruptly. From there, the tail is covered with smooth hair and tapers to a fine point.","temperament":"The Irish Water Spaniels are confident, cheerful dogs with an endearing sense of humor. They're very affectionate toward their families—including kids. However, they are typically suspicious of strangers and don't always get along with other dogs or pets.\n\nBecause they're energetic, intelligent dogs, Irish Water Spaniels need a home where they can get plenty of physical and mental exercise. Irish Water Spaniels are relatively quiet, but they can become great watch dogs if they're [properly socialized from a young age](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization).","care-nutrition":"Irish Water Spaniels need a high-quality diet formulated for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior) and activity level. To prevent your pup from becoming overweight, keep a close eye on their food portions. And be sure to take treats into account when tracking their daily calorie intake. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of a dog's calories.","care-grooming":"Because their coats are hair and not fur, Irish Water Spaniels are an excellent breed for people with allergies. Minimal shedding means they only need to be brushed once every week or two. And because of its texture, the Irish Water Spaniel's hair is less likely to embed itself in carpets or upholstery. However, this breed does need regular haircuts, ideally from professional groomers.\n\nLong ears make Irish Water Spaniels more susceptible to ear infections. So, check and clean your dog's ears routinely to prevent infections.\n\nYour Irish Water Spaniel's nails will wear down somewhat during daily activity. But they still need regular inspections for splits or cracks and should be trimmed to keep them at an ideal length.\n\nIn addition to professional dental cleanings, establish a regular at-home dental care routine that includes teeth brushing and dental chews or treats. Maintaining good [dental hygiene](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) is essential for the overall long-term health of Irish Water Spaniels.","care-exercise":"Irish Water Spaniels are high-energy dogs that need a lot of daily exercise. Long walks, hikes, and backyard play sessions are great ways for them to burn energy and spend time with their family members.\n\nBecause the breed originated to retrieve and swim, fetching tennis balls from the water will make Irish Water Spaniels very happy pups.","care-training":"Highly intelligent and eager to please, Irish Water Spaniels respond best to positive reinforcement and reward-based training using their favorite treats or toys. To hold their interest, keep training sessions fun and short.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/lifestyle/irish-water-spaniel-facts/\n\nhttp://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/IrishWaterSpaniel.pdf\n\nhttps://www.iwsca.org/whatisaniws.htm\n\nhttps://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/irish-water-spaniel/","reviewed-by":"Annette

Rough Haired Pointer","plural-name":"German Rough Haired Pointers","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"Known in their native Germany as the Deutsch Stichelhaar, the German Rough Haired Pointer is the oldest rough-coated pointing dog—dating back to 1888.\n\nYou might think German Rough Haired Pointers are just another variety of the [German Shorthaired Pointer](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/german-shorthaired-pointer). However, this breed is actually a variety of the German Partridge Dog. When developing German Rough Haired Pointers, breeders didn't use any English pointing breeds. This makes them the rarest of all of the versatile German gun dog breeds.\n\nMuch like the [German Longhaired Pointer](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/german-longhaired-pointer), this breed's ability to work in the field, water, and forest makes it highly desirable for tracking, as well as retrieving, game.","facts":"German Rough Haired Pointers are self-assured, loyal, and intelligent dogs. This breed is balanced, calm, and courageous—characteristics that make for a versatile gun dog.","traits-appearance":"German Rough Haired Pointers are strong, large pointing dogs. They have stiff, hard coats, distinguished beards, and pronounced eyebrows that give them a grim appearance.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The breed's distinguishing characteristic is its rough coat—described as stiff, harsh and bristly—with feathering around the legs. Hair forms a moderately-developed beard on the muzzle, and bushy, strong eyebrows.\n\nThe German Rough Haired Pointer's coloring is consistent with many in the sporting class. It comes several varieties— brown (with or without white patches), brown roan (with or without brown patches), or light roan (with or without brown patches).","traits-physical":"German Rough Haired Pointers have medium-length ears. They're not very broad at the base and have rounded tips. Their tails are also medium-length, strong at the root, and carried straight or with a very slight upward bend.","temperament":"Loyal dogs, German Rough Haired Pointers are good with children—especially when raised in a family setting. Though they generally have a calm and even temperament, they do have a lot of energy.\n\nGerman Rough Haired Pointers thrive when provided with lots of mental and physical exercise. Because they're sporting dogs, they may chase or hunt small animals—including cats, other small pets, or wildlife.","care-nutrition":"To meet their nutritional needs, feed your German Rough Haired Pointer a high-quality food that's appropriate for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior) and activity level. They may also benefit from diets formulated specifically for large-breed dogs. In particular, large-breed puppy diets prevent this breed from growing too fast—which may decrease the incidence or severity of hip dysplasia as your dog ages.\n\nTo keep your German Rough Haired Pointer at a healthy weight, monitor their food intake carefully. Avoid accidental overfeeding by measuring out meals. And don't forget to account for treats in their daily calorie totals. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of your dog's calories.","care-grooming":"The German Rough Haired Pointer's coat is relatively low-maintenance. Weekly brushing with a comb will remove loose hair and dirt. Occasional baths may be necessary. You should also clip your dog's nails regularly to keep them at a short length. Overgrown nails can become painful or lead to issues walking or running.\n\nIn addition to professional dental cleanings, establish an at-home dental care routine that includes teeth brushing. Maintaining good [dental hygiene](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) is essential for the overall long-term health of all dogs.","care-exercise":"German Rough Haired Pointers have higher exercise needs than most dogs.

Dane","plural-name":"Great Danes","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"Evidence from Egyptian tombs suggests dogs resembling the Great Dane have existed for thousands of years. However, many believe that Great Danes come from an Asian Mastiff-type dog brought to Germany by ancient Iranian nomads. That's right: the Great Dane is not Danish at all, hailing instead from Germany.\n\nGreat Danes hunted boar in Germany during the 1500s. But it wasn't until the late 1800s that the breed became standardized in Germany and earned its own club in the United States.\n\nCropping of the Great Dane's ears is somewhat common in the United States. But it's rare in Europe. In fact, some countries such as Denmark, Australia, and New Zealand ban ear cropping altogether. The original purpose of ear cropping was to protect the dog's ears from wolves and boars during hunting. Today, the practice is widely considered cruel and unnecessary.","facts":"The Great Dane is a friendly, intelligent breed famous for its size. Despite their affectionate and often goofy demeanor, Great Danes make excellent guard dogs thanks to their loyalty and devotion to their people. There's plenty to love about these gentle giants.","traits-appearance":"Great Danes are impressive giants that loom over most other dogs. The breed has a sleek, athletic build and a muscular, yet elegant, body.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"There are six acceptable colors for the short coats of Great Danes: fawn, brindle, blue, black, harlequin, and mantle.","traits-physical":"Great Danes are known for their considerable size. When standing on their hind legs, adult dogs are often taller than their owners!\n\nTheir heads are large, long, and narrow with deep and dark eyes, floppy ears, and a long and graceful neck. Their straight legs are set upright.","temperament":"With a reputation for being good watchdogs and dependable home guardians, Great Danes usually have a pleasant, easy-going nature.\n\nThey aim to please, enjoy receiving attention, and have no trouble making friends wherever they go, thanks to their confidence. Great Danes are often known for their characteristic lean on people they like, and their ability to sit like humans on couches and large furniture.\n\nGreat Danes form strong bonds with their families and are patient, playful, and gentle with children. When [properly socialized](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization), Danes are outgoing toward strangers and generally good with other pets in the household.","care-nutrition":"It's best to feed your Great Dane a high-quality dog food appropriate for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). Great Danes may benefit from diets formulated specifically for large-breed dogs. In particular, large-breed puppy diets prevent young Danes from growing too fast, which may decrease the incidence or severity of hip dysplasia as they age.\n\nGreat Danes are prone to bloat (also known as twisted stomach). To help prevent bloat, break up their daily feedings into several meals, and use a food bowl designed to slow their rate of eating. When timing meals, avoid feeding them immediately before or after vigorous activity.\n\nThese are just a few ways you can help prevent this life-threatening condition. Your veterinarian is the best resource for other recommendations—including surgical options—for preventing bloat.","care-grooming":"Great Danes generally don't shed much due to their short, smooth coat.\n\nBut during shedding season (happens once or twice a year), they may leave behind quite a lot of hair. You can keep shedding to a minimum by brushing your pup weekly with a medium-bristle brush, rubber grooming mitt or tool, or hound glove.\n\nGreat Danes only need occasional baths unless they get into something that makes them particularly dirty—which isn't unheard of for these goofs! As with all breeds, regular nail trimming is a must. Overly long nails can cause the dog pain and problems walking or running.","care-exercise":"Despite its large size, the Great Dane needs daily exercise. Regular walks with their favorite person (or people) often do the trick. Danes make good jogging or hiking partners. But keep in mind that they should be at least two years old before engaging in these activities to prevent damage to their growing joints.\n\nGreat Danes also seem to enjoy dog sports—such as agility, tracking, weight pull, flyball, musical freestyle, and both rally and competitive obedience.","care-training":"[Obedience training](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-obedience-training), including early socialization and puppy training classes, is a must for the large and powerful Great Dane.\n\nThis breed responds to firm and consistent training methods and learns quickly. But Danes can be stubborn, so keep plenty of treats and favorite toys on hand to use as rewards during training sessions.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/great-dane/\n\nhttps://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/bloat-gastric-dilatation-and-volvulus-in-dogs","reviewed-by":"Annette Louviere, DVM","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":43.5,"weight-range-pet-max":69.4,"weight-range-show-min":49.9,"weight-range-show-max":70.3,"height-range-min":74.0,"height-range-max":89.0,"life-span-range-min":6.0,"life-span-range-max":10.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":80,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":47,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":32},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/458d3b1c-18e5-5828-a937-59307dfe7b5c/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/458d3b1c-18e5-5828-a937-59307dfe7b5c/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/458d3b1c-18e5-5828-a937-59307dfe7b5c/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/458d3b1c-18e5-5828-a937-59307dfe7b5c/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/458d3b1c-18e5-5828-a937-59307dfe7b5c/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/458d3b1c-18e5-5828-a937-59307dfe7b5c/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/458d3b1c-18e5-5828-a937-59307dfe7b5c/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/458d3b1c-18e5-5828-a937-59307dfe7b5c/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/458d3b1c-18e5-5828-a937-59307dfe7b5c/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/458d3b1c-18e5-5828-a937-59307dfe7b5c/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/458d3b1c-18e5-5828-a937-59307dfe7b5c/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/458d3b1c-18e5-5828-a937-59307dfe7b5c/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/458d3b1c-18e5-5828-a937-59307dfe7b5c/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/458d3b1c-18e5-5828-a937-59307dfe7b5c/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/458d3b1c-18e5-5828-a937-59307dfe7b5c/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/458d3b1c-18e5-5828-a937-59307dfe7b5c/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/458d3b1c-18e5-5828-a937-59307dfe7b5c/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/458d3b1c-18e5-5828-a937-59307dfe7b5c/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"466d903c-f19a-5199-8190-042ffc840cf0","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/466d903c-f19a-5199-8190-042ffc840cf0"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"curly-coated-retriever","name":"Curly-Coated Retriever","plural-name":"Curly-Coated Retrievers","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"At first glance, the Curly-Coated Retriever (affectionately called a \"Curly\" by fans) might look like a Labradoodle. However, this breed precedes the relatively new Labradoodle dog. In fact, the Curly-Coated Retriever is one of the oldest retriever breeds, dating back to early 19th-century England.\n\nThe exact lineage of the breed is unconfirmed. But most experts believe the Curly-Coated Retriever descended from the Close-Curled English Water Dog, the St. John's Newfoundland, and the Old Water Spaniel.\n\nWith its distinctive coat of dense, tight curls, the Curly earned a reputation as a tireless, versatile hunting companion capable of working in even the harshest of weather conditions. Often owned by British gamekeepers and poachers rather than aristocrats, this breed earned the nickname of \"blue-collar\" retriever.\n\nThough the breed's popularity decreased in England, it increased in Australia and New Zealand. The Curly-Coated Retriever came to the United States in 1907, and the AKC recognized the breed in 1924.","facts":"The Curly-Coated Retriever is a highly intelligent, alert, and friendly dog—as well as a devoted family member. This breed tends to be independent and less needy compared to others in the retriever family.","traits-appearance":"The Curly-Coated Retriever is a large, sturdy dog best known for its characteristic coat made of small, tight curls.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Curly's dense mass of tight curls lie close to the skin and offer protection from icy water and thorny shrubs. These curls cover most of the dog's body, but its face and front of its legs remain straight-haired.\n\nThe Curly-Coated Retriever comes in black or a dark liver. A few white hairs on the chest are allowed by the breed standards. But a full white patch is considered undesirable.","traits-physical":"Curlies have tapered, wedge-shaped heads—a feature that distinguishes them from all other retriever breeds. Their ears are small, set on a line slightly above the corner of the eye, close to the head. The curls on their ears may be looser than on the rest of their body.\n\nCurly-Coated Retrievers have straight or relatively straight tails that reach almost to the hock. And they're covered in the trademark curls.","temperament":"Curly-Coated Retrievers need lots of attention and frequent exercise. For these reasons, a Curly should be part of an active family, preferably one that can provide plenty of outdoor space for them to run and play. (So, apartment living is not a good fit for a Curly.)\n\nThese charming, gentle, and affectionate family dogs are friendly towards children and other pets. But they may be aloof or suspicious of strangers. This quality makes them better watchdogs than other, more outgoing retrievers.\n\nCurlies don't reach maturity until they're three years old. That means their \"puppy phase\" will go on longer than with other breeds.","care-nutrition":"Curly-Coated Retrievers need high-quality food that's appropriate for their life stage (puppy, adult, or senior). To prevent them from becoming overweight or obese, monitor their food and treats carefully. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of their daily calories.","care-grooming":"Curly-Coated Retrievers require only minimal grooming. Brushing tends to cause their curls to frizz, so many Curly owners choose instead to wet them down and let their coats air-dry. During their shedding season, you may need to use a metal-pronged grooming tool to remove dead hair.\n\nThough nails will wear down with activity, they'll likely still need regular trims to stay at an ideal length. Nails that get too long can lead to pain or issues with walking or running.\n\nAll dogs need ongoing [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care), including at-home teeth brushing and professional dental cleanings. Maintaining good dental hygiene is essential for their overall long-term health. The sooner you get your dog into a good dental care routine, the better.","care-exercise":"True to their sporting dog background, Curly-Coated Retrievers need a lot of daily exercise. A bored or pent-up Curly may turn to undesirable behaviors to release energy or entertain themselves. Luckily, they enjoy plenty of physical activities, including hunting, tracking, field trials, agility, retrieving, rally, and competitive obedience.\n\nCurly-Coated Retrievers also love swimming and being outdoors in general—making them ideal jogging and hiking companions.","care-training":"Curlies respond well to reward-based training.

The original dog—referred to as “the Native American’s dog”—was already present when Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto landed in Florida in 1539 and took note of them. These dogs—which were said to look like wolves but bark like dogs—were crossed with many different breeds, including Greyhounds, Bloodhounds and Mastiffs. In Louisiana—where the dog is still revered—Native Americans started calling these dogs “Wolf Dogs.”\n\nAfter being crossed again with French hounds, the resulting dogs became what we refer to today as Catahoula Leopard Dogs. In the Catahoula Lake area of Central Louisiana, the breed was used to corral wild hogs and cows. Over time they perfected their efforts, creating a “fence” around the herd and directing them to where they needed to go.","facts":"The Catahoula Leopard Dog may be a beautiful breed, but there’s a lot to consider before taking one of these working dogs home. They can be territorial and protective, so early training and socialization is necessary. If properly trained, you’re left with a dog that is loyal and affectionate.  There are few Catahoula Leopard Dogs these days, and as such they are members of the American Kennel Club’s Foundation Stock Service, which aims to help purebreds continue to develop while maintaining reliable records.","traits-appearance":"The Catahoula Leopard Dog is a medium-sized, athletic dog that’s most often associated with the mottled coat that is so common in the breed, but they can actually come in many different colors and patterns. The Catahoula eye can also be different colors or combinations.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Catahoula Leopard Dog is named so in reference to the mottled coat of most Catahoulas, which resembles a leopard, and is the result of the merle gene. However, not all Catahoulas have a mottled coat, and the breed actually comes in a variety of coat colors and patterns.","traits-physical":"The two most distinctive physical traits for the Catahoula Leopard Dog are both its coat and its eyes. The coat is most often mottled (hence the name “Leopard”), while their eyes can come in a variety of colors as well, and each one can be a different color.","temperament":"This breed has a strong work ethic, and requires plenty of exercise to get out all of their pent up energy. Although they can be reserved and territorial with strangers, with the proper training and socializing, they become loyal and loving pets.\n\nOnce Catahoula Leopard Dogs understands their place within the family ranking, they are affectionate and loyal. Since they are traditionally pack hounds, they do best with owners who are dominant and can lead.\n\nEarly training and socialization is essential for this breed, especially since they can be territorial and reserved with strangers. Without the proper training and exercise they can also become destructive.","care-nutrition":"Catahoula Leopard Dogs require a high-quality dog food that is age-appropriate—whether it’s commercially manufactured or homemade (with a veterinarian’s supervision and approval). It’s important to monitor the amount of food you give your Catahoula Leopard Dog. Reduce the portions or restrict calories if your pup gains weight. Your veterinarian is always a good source to help provide you with appropriate nutrition and feeding guidelines.","care-grooming":"Like most dogs, the Catahoula Leopard Dog has a coat that requires regular grooming. Weekly brushes, along with occasional baths, will keep it in top shape.\n\nAll dogs require regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care), including at-home teeth brushing and professional dental cleanings, and the Catahoula Leopard Dog is no exception. Maintaining good dental hygiene is important for their overall long-term health.","care-exercise":"As they are very active and don’t do well in pent-up areas or small homes, you should provide ample exercise for your Catahoula Leopard Dog, Without plenty of movement and stimulation each day, these dogs can become destructive with undesirable digging and chewing.\n\nLuckily, the Catahoula Leopard Dog loves almost any activity. It adores swimming, hiking, or other outdoor retrieving activities, like fetch or Frisbee. Walks work as well, especially if you take multiple walks a day. This breed also enjoys dog sports, like agility, which are a great way to provide them with the exercise they need and crave.","care-training":"Since the Catahoula Leopard Dog has an independent and destructive streak, early and proper training is important. They can also be shy around strangers and territorial, so socialization is essential. Once they’ve been properly trained, though, the Catahoula Leopard Dog is loyal and gentle.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/catahoula-leopard-dog/\n\nhttps://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/foundation-stock-service/\n\nhttps://www.nalc-inc.org/eye-colors","reviewed-by":"Laura Inman, DVM","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":20.4,"weight-range-pet-max":39.5,"weight-range-show-min":24.9,"weight-range-show-max":36.3,"height-range-min":51.0,"height-range-max":66.0,"life-span-range-min":10.0,"life-span-range-max":14.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":101,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":65,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":43},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/466f08e0-e84c-52e7-b4b3-a0dc95740d5a/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/466f08e0-e84c-52e7-b4b3-a0dc95740d5a/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/466f08e0-e84c-52e7-b4b3-a0dc95740d5a/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/466f08e0-e84c-52e7-b4b3-a0dc95740d5a/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/466f08e0-e84c-52e7-b4b3-a0dc95740d5a/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/466f08e0-e84c-52e7-b4b3-a0dc95740d5a/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/466f08e0-e84c-52e7-b4b3-a0dc95740d5a/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/466f08e0-e84c-52e7-b4b3-a0dc95740d5a/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/466f08e0-e84c-52e7-b4b3-a0dc95740d5a/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/466f08e0-e84c-52e7-b4b3-a0dc95740d5a/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/466f08e0-e84c-52e7-b4b3-a0dc95740d5a/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/466f08e0-e84c-52e7-b4b3-a0dc95740d5a/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/466f08e0-e84c-52e7-b4b3-a0dc95740d5a/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/466f08e0-e84c-52e7-b4b3-a0dc95740d5a/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/466f08e0-e84c-52e7-b4b3-a0dc95740d5a/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/466f08e0-e84c-52e7-b4b3-a0dc95740d5a/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/466f08e0-e84c-52e7-b4b3-a0dc95740d5a/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/466f08e0-e84c-52e7-b4b3-a0dc95740d5a/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"469c030f-e35d-5a45-9dfb-630f38273afb","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/469c030f-e35d-5a45-9dfb-630f38273afb"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"berger-picard","name":"Berger Picard","plural-name":"Berger Picards","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The Berger Picard is believed to be one of the oldest herding dogs in the world, with origins dating back to the 9th century. The breed, which comes from the region of Picardy, France, has close ties to other French herding dogs like the Briard and Beauceron; it was not awarded its own breed designation until 1925.\n\nAlthough French farmers loved the indigenous sheepdog, the Berger Picard almost became extinct during both World War I and World War II. Even though it has made somewhat of a comeback—and gained acclaim for its title role in the movie “Because of Winn Dixie”—the Berger Picard is still rare, even in its native France.","facts":"The Berger Picard is a good-natured, athletic dog that thrives on outdoor activities and affection. An excellent addition to active families, these dogs have captured hearts for generations.","traits-appearance":"The Berger Picard is a solid, muscular breed with harmonious proportions and no signs of bulkiness. These are alert, confident dogs with tireless, efficient movements and observant, confident, spirited gaze.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Berger Picard is a double-coated breed with a short, soft, dense undercoat and an outer coat that is harsh and crisp to the touch. The hairs on its outercoat are two to three inches all over their bodies and should have a slight wave but must never be flat, curly, woolly, soft, or so profuse that it hides the outline of their bodies. The Berger Picard is shown in its natural state; their coats must not be sculpted, shaped, or scissored.\n\nAccents on the head and neck include moderate-length hair that contributes to rough eyebrows, moderate beard, and moustache, and a slight ruff on the front and sides of the neck—a distinct look known as griffonage—lend the breed its distinct appearance.\n\nThe Berger Picard comes in two colors: fawn and brindle. Fawn dogs may be clear or true fawn with no dark markings or fawn charbonné (fawn with dark charcoal trim on the outer edges of the ears and a gray underlay on their heads and bodies). Brindle dogs can be any shade of base color from black to light grey or fawn with stripes, of black, brown, red, grey, or fawn distributed throughout their coats.","traits-physical":"Berger Picards are powerful dogs with strong, level backs; muscular shoulders and hindquarters; strong loins; and deep chests. Their tails are strong at the base and taper to the tip; at rest, the tail hangs straight and reaches to the point of the hock, ending in a slight “J” or crook without falling to the right or left.\n\nThese dogs have ears that are high-set, broad at the base and taper to a slightly rounded tip and medium-sized, oval-shaped eyes that are medium to dark brown and convey an alert, observant, confident expression.","temperament":"Berger Picards are observant, good-natured, and even-tempered. Known as independent problem solvers with strong stubborn streaks, Berger Picards are also loving and devoted companions. The breed can be reserved with strangers but should not be timid or nervous.\n\nTrue to their herding roots, Berger Picards require a great deal of exercise and are best suited to active families. These dogs also have a sensitive side and prefer to not be on their own for long periods of time. If left alone too long, Berger Picards can become bored and destructive.","care-nutrition":"Feed Berger Picards a high-quality dog food that is appropriate for their life stage (puppy, adult, senior) and consider a diet formulated for active breeds. Like all dogs, Berger Picards could become overweight if they are allowed to eat as much as they want. Portioning out their food with a measuring cup and limiting treats to no more than 10% of their daily calories can help keep these dogs fit and trim.","care-grooming":"Berger Picards have waterproof double coats that do not require much grooming. Brush them at least once per week to remove dead hair and, during spring and fall when these dogs blow their coats, brush them with an undercoat rake several times per week to reduce shedding. Keep their ears clean and their nails trimmed.\n\nBerger Picards also benefit from a regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) routine that includes at-home teeth brushing and professional cleanings.","care-exercise":"Berger Picards are working dogs that require lots of exercise. These dogs love brisk walks, hiking, and swimming or games like fetch to help them burn off their abundant energy. Berger Picards also participate in dog sports such as competitive obedience, agility, tracking, flyball, rally, and herding. Mental stimulation is important, too. Provide Berger Picards with puzzle toys to help keep their minds engaged.","care-training":"Berger Picards are both intelligent and stubborn, which means they can learn new things easily but may choose to ignore commands. Skip harsh reprimands and punishments, which can cause the sensitive breed to shut down. Appeal to their eager-to-please natures with positive reinforcement and rewards-based training. A training regimen that is consistent and fast-paced will appeal to the energetic working dogs and help channel their energy in positive directions.\n\nSocialization is important, too. Introduce Berger Picards to new people, pets, and places to encourage their good-natured, observant personalities.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/berger-picard/\n\nhttp://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/BergerPicard.pdf","reviewed-by":"Cindy Elston, DVM, MPH","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":23.1,"weight-range-pet-max":32.2,"weight-range-show-min":23.1,"weight-range-show-max":32.2,"height-range-min":53.0,"height-range-max":66.0,"life-span-range-min":12.0,"life-span-range-max":13.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":85,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":54,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":39},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/469c030f-e35d-5a45-9dfb-630f38273afb/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/469c030f-e35d-5a45-9dfb-630f38273afb/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/469c030f-e35d-5a45-9dfb-630f38273afb/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/469c030f-e35d-5a45-9dfb-630f38273afb/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/469c030f-e35d-5a45-9dfb-630f38273afb/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/469c030f-e35d-5a45-9dfb-630f38273afb/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/469c030f-e35d-5a45-9dfb-630f38273afb/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/469c030f-e35d-5a45-9dfb-630f38273afb/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/469c030f-e35d-5a45-9dfb-630f38273afb/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/469c030f-e35d-5a45-9dfb-630f38273afb/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/469c030f-e35d-5a45-9dfb-630f38273afb/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/469c030f-e35d-5a45-9dfb-630f38273afb/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/469c030f-e35d-5a45-9dfb-630f38273afb/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/469c030f-e35d-5a45-9dfb-630f38273afb/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/469c030f-e35d-5a45-9dfb-630f38273afb/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/469c030f-e35d-5a45-9dfb-630f38273afb/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/469c030f-e35d-5a45-9dfb-630f38273afb/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/469c030f-e35d-5a45-9dfb-630f38273afb/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"469ce562-d44e-51d6-9895-a800be080ac5","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/469ce562-d44e-51d6-9895-a800be080ac5"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"german-shorthaired-pointer","name":"German Shorthaired Pointer","plural-name":"German Shorthaired Pointers","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The German Shorthaired Pointer, or GSP, was developed in Germany in the late 19th century to meet the need for an all-round hunting dog. Breeders sought to develop an excellent pointer with a good nose—a dog that could retrieve birds as well as animals.\n\nInitially, German hunters thought that a cross between a Spanish Pointer and Hannover Hound would possess these abilities. However, the resulting breed tended to bay when trailing. They then tried crosses with the Bloodhound, Foxhound, and various French hounds. But none hit the mark precisely.\n\nBreeding with the English Pointer finally resulted in a dog that appeared perfect. Still, even this breed had an aversion to water and tracking at times. Fortunately, continuous breeding eliminated these unwanted traits. And the German Shorthaired Pointer became a lean, athletic, and responsive breed.\n\nThe German Kennel Club first registered the breed in 1872. German Shorthaired Pointers arrived in the United States in the 1920s. Impressed by the versatility of the breed after reading an article about it, a man named Charles R. Thornton shipped two dogs to his home in Missoula, Montana.\n\nThe American Kennel Club recognized the German Shorthaired Pointer as a breed in 1930. Today, it's consistently one of the top-winning breeds in competitive hunting events.","facts":"The German Shorthaired Pointer is an intelligent, good-natured, friendly breed. It makes an enthusiastic, versatile hunting companion as well as a happy, loyal pet for active families.","traits-appearance":"The German Shorthaired Pointer has an aristocratic and well-balanced look. The breed's overall structure suggests power, endurance, and agility.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The German Shorthaired Pointer's hair is thick and short, though slightly longer on the haunches and tail. The breed's coat is black, liver, or a combination of liver and white—including particolor, patched, and ticked.","traits-physical":"German Shorthaired Pointers have long muzzles that allow them to seize game and carry it for long periods. Their eyes are medium-size, almond-shaped, and ideally dark brown. They're also very expressive, portraying intelligence, good-humor, and energy.\n\nThe breed's ears are broad and set fairly high, lying flat. They should extend to the corner of the mouth.","temperament":"The German Shorthaired Pointer is an excellent breed for active, outdoorsy families. These loving, loyal, protective dogs tend to be friendly towards children. GSPs enjoy being around people and want nothing more than to be included in family life.\n\nThis breed is usually safe around other pets and dogs. But it's not uncommon for them to display dominant behavior. Because of their hunting instincts, they love to play and chase. However, GSPs may choose unwilling playmates, such as cats or wildlife.\n\nGerman Shorthaired Pointers make commendable watch dogs. And though they may be reserved with strangers, they are generally very sociable dogs.\n\nGSPs are an intelligent and highly energetic breed. They mature later than other breeds. The resulting elongated \"puppy phase\" can be challenging for some owners.\n\nGerman Shorthaired Pointers need plenty of activity and exercise to be happy. If they get bored, they may take it upon themselves to find things to do, which can lead to undesired behaviors, such as barking or digging.","care-nutrition":"To meet their nutritional needs, feed your GSP a high-quality food appropriate for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior) and activity level.\n\nGerman Shorthaired Pointers are prone to bloat (also known as twisted stomach). To help prevent this condition, don't feed your dog immediately after any kind of vigorous activity. And wait at least an hour after meals before allowing them to run or exercise.\n\nTo keep your dog at a healthy weight, monitor their food intake carefully. Avoid accidental overfeeding by measuring out meals. And don't forget to account for treats in their daily calorie totals. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of a dog's calories.","care-grooming":"The German Shorthaired Pointer's grooming needs are relatively few. Most of the year, weekly brushing is all it takes to keep the breed's coat looking good. During periods of heavy shedding, your GSP will need frequent brushing to remove loose hairs and prevent them from ending up in unwanted places.\n\nIt's also smart to trim nails regularly to keep them short and tidy. Overgrown nails can split and become painful, or lead to issues walking or running.\n\nIn addition to professional dental cleanings, establish an at-home dental care routine that includes regular daily teeth brushing. Though that may seem ambitious, maintaining good [dental hygiene](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) is essential for the overall long-term health of all dogs.","care-exercise":"German Shorthaired Pointers have a higher exercise requirement than most dogs. Long daily walks, running in enclosed yards, hiking, and swimming are all outdoor activities that they enjoy. But the ultimate way to a GSP's heart is retrieving, whether that involves a tennis ball or frisbee.\n\nThis breed also seems to enjoy dog sports—such as field trials, tracking, agility, and competitive obedience—which provide both physical exercise and mental stimulation.","care-training":"German Shorthaired Pointers are intelligent, extremely eager to please, and hard-working—qualities that make them easy to train. Consistent, firm training starting from an early age and positive reinforcement techniques are the best ways to train a GSP.\n\nAs all breeds do, German Shorthaired Pointers benefit from[Early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization).

At that time, it was fashionable to import English Toy Terriers. Loved for their small size and energetic personality, these dogs often went to social events alongside the upper class. At the start of the 20th century, the breed became known as the Russian (Russkiy) Toy Terrier.\n\nBreeding stopped during the Russian Revolution in 1917, nearly driving these dogs to extinction. After Stalin's death, several regions of the Soviet Union worked to bring the Russian Toy Terriers back. But the resulting breed was very different from the English Toy Terrier, and it came in both short- and long-coat varieties.\n\n\"Terrier\" was removed from the breed's name in 2006 when the Russian Toy joined the Fédération Cynologique Internationale list of recognized breeds.","facts":"Lively and merry, the Russian Toy breed has a sharp intelligence and seeks to please. Russian Toys are superb dogs for folks of all stripes. They love to cuddle and be near their human companions.","traits-appearance":"Long legs and a lean yet muscular build complement the elegant look of the petite Russian Toy.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Russian Toy's coat can be short (smooth, close-lying, and shiny) or long (soft, and wavy to curly). It may be black and tan, chocolate and tan, blue and tan, red, red sable, or red-brown. Small white markings and brindle are also possible, but the latter is disqualified by the breed standard.","traits-physical":"With a tiny head, large eyes, and triangular ears, the Russian Toy is one of the smallest breeds in the world.","temperament":"Intelligent, affectionate, and outgoing, the Russian Toy is a people-oriented breed that forms close family bonds. These easy-going dogs interact well with both children and elderly people. (Of course, all dogs should be supervised around kids to ensure safety.)\n\nThe breed thrives on human companionship and doesn't do well if left alone, as it often suffers from separation anxiety. In general, the Russian Toy is a cheerful little rascal that loves to scamper about the yard and play. But at the same time, they're also happy to lounge around the house all day.","care-nutrition":"The Russian Toy requires a high-quality, age-appropriate (e.g., puppy, adult, senior) diet. You should monitor how much your Russian Toy eats, and reduce portions if they gain excess weight. Also, remember that giving too many treats can contribute to obesity.","care-grooming":"When it comes to grooming, this breed is relatively low-maintenance. To keep your longhaired Russian Toy looking their best, brush a couple of times per week, and give baths monthly. For the smooth-coated Russian Toy, a weekly brushing and the occasional bath are sufficient.","care-exercise":"The Russian Toy is a happy, moderately energetic, playful dog that benefits from several walks each day. But this breed's neck and trachea are fragile. So, be sure to use a harness rather than a collar on walks.\n\nRussian Toys also excel in obedience, agility, rally, and tracking. If they don't get enough exercise, they may bark excessively or turn to destructive behavior to satisfy pent-up energy.","care-training":"This toy breed requires consistent obedience training to prevent small dog syndrome (when little dogs become overly dominant). Otherwise, your Russian Toy might constantly bark, nip at strangers, or challenge your authority.\n\n[Early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) can help teach your Russian Toy good manners and ensure they interact with other dogs safely.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Dogs/Xac4CQAAQBAJ\n\nhttps://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/russian-toy/","reviewed-by":"Annette Louviere, DVM","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":1.4,"weight-range-pet-max":2.9,"weight-range-show-min":1.4,"weight-range-show-max":2.9,"height-range-min":18.0,"height-range-max":28.0,"life-span-range-min":12.0,"life-span-range-max":14.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":69,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":48,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":35},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/46b2f88f-f12e-5343-86a9-7ff96b8bd1e1/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/46b2f88f-f12e-5343-86a9-7ff96b8bd1e1/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/46b2f88f-f12e-5343-86a9-7ff96b8bd1e1/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/46b2f88f-f12e-5343-86a9-7ff96b8bd1e1/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/46b2f88f-f12e-5343-86a9-7ff96b8bd1e1/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/46b2f88f-f12e-5343-86a9-7ff96b8bd1e1/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/46b2f88f-f12e-5343-86a9-7ff96b8bd1e1/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/46b2f88f-f12e-5343-86a9-7ff96b8bd1e1/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/46b2f88f-f12e-5343-86a9-7ff96b8bd1e1/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/46b2f88f-f12e-5343-86a9-7ff96b8bd1e1/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/46b2f88f-f12e-5343-86a9-7ff96b8bd1e1/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/46b2f88f-f12e-5343-86a9-7ff96b8bd1e1/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/46b2f88f-f12e-5343-86a9-7ff96b8bd1e1/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/46b2f88f-f12e-5343-86a9-7ff96b8bd1e1/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/46b2f88f-f12e-5343-86a9-7ff96b8bd1e1/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/46b2f88f-f12e-5343-86a9-7ff96b8bd1e1/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/46b2f88f-f12e-5343-86a9-7ff96b8bd1e1/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/46b2f88f-f12e-5343-86a9-7ff96b8bd1e1/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"47045621-a13d-5c54-b822-bbc9bbf0ceca","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/47045621-a13d-5c54-b822-bbc9bbf0ceca"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"koolie","name":"Australian Koolie","plural-name":"Australian Koolies","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"A working dog from Australia, the Australian Koolie—or Koolie—was believed to be a result of crossbreeding smooth-coated blue merle Collies with black and tan Collies. According to local legend, the Koolie got its name from German immigrants in South Australia who could not pronounce “Collie” and called the dogs “coolies” instead.\n\nThe Australian Koolie is a newer breed that has been around for less than 200 years. During that time, the breed has earned their reputation as outstanding working dogs. International breed standards promote their working dog attributes over their appearances to ensure that Australian Koolies remain excellent herding dogs with the speed, stamina, and ability to get the job done.","facts":"The Australian Koolie is, first and foremost, a working dog. The breed is known for its speed and stamina herding sheep and driving cattle, but these sweet-natured, devoted dogs can also be excellent companions for active owners.","traits-appearance":"Koolies are strong, agile dogs with well-muscled bodies and free, tireless gaits.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Australian Koolies are a double-coated breed with a short, dense, rain-resistant undercoat and a close, flat outer coat. While some Koolies have short, smooth hair, others can have medium or long hair.\n\nThe breed comes in many colors, including solid black, red/chocolate, black and white, red and white, and tri-colored solid red or black with white markings and brown points. They can also have a grey, black, red/chocolate or white undercoat with large splashes of dark colorings, including red/chocolate for red merles or black and grey for blue merles.","traits-physical":"Like other active herding breeds, Koolies have deep chests, muscular loins and shoulders, and well-furnished tails that hang in a slight curve to blend with a rounded, sloping rump.","temperament":"Australian Koolies are patient and dedicated. These dogs are equally committed to their work and their owners, offering stamina and skill along with devotion and loyalty. Often mistaken as being shy or timid, Koolies can seem reserved around strangers. The breed is not aggressive but can demonstrate dominance.\n\nTheir natural herding instincts can make Koolies eager to control animals and children. These bundles of energy do best in active homes where owners understand their need for regular, high-intensity physical activity.","care-nutrition":"Feed Australian Koolies a high-quality dog food that is appropriate for their life stage (puppy, adult, senior) and consider a diet formulated for active breeds. These high energy dogs are not known for becoming overweight, but portioning out their food with a measuring cup and limiting treats to no more than 10 percent of their daily calories can help keep Australian Shepherds fit and trim.","care-grooming":"Australian Koolies have minimal grooming requirements. Brush their coats at least once per week to remove dead hair and, during spring and fall when these dogs blow their coats, use an undercoat rake several times per week. Keep their ears clean, and their nails trimmed.\n\nLike all breeds, Australian Koolies benefit from a regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) routine that includes at-home teeth brushing and professional cleanings.","care-exercise":"These are working dogs that want to be on the move and require active owners committed to providing regular exercise. Koolies make great running partners and also enjoy brisk walks, hiking, swimming, and other activities that allow them to burn some energy and display their speed and stamina.","care-training":"Australian Koolies are intelligent and keen to learn new things but require training to adopt positive behaviors. These dogs love spending time with their owners and will see training as a bonding experience.\n\nFocus on positive reinforcement and reward-based training. Avoid repetitive activities, which will cause Koolies to lose interest in training.

The dogs served various purposes in society. People used their teeth and bones to make weapons and tools. Some were companion animals, whereas others were a source of food.\n\nEventually, European dogs came to the islands. Experts believe that they crossbred with the Polynesian dogs, contributing to the breed's eventual disappearance.\n\nModern descendants of the Polynesian dog roam the streets and beaches of the islands. Many of these semi-feral dogs are sick or neglected. Grassroots efforts by volunteer veterinarians to spay and neuter the population have helped humanely control Polynesian street dog numbers and increase their overall quality of life.","facts":"The Polynesian dog is a now-extinct variety of domesticated dog.

But the coats of modern street dogs may be any combination of colors, patterns, and lengths.","traits-physical":"Free-roaming dogs do not follow a breed standard, so there is no shared set of traits that links them together. However, the Polynesian street dog had a broad head, erect ears, small eyes, and a pointed muzzle.","temperament":"Street dogs have learned to fend for themselves. So, they tend to be scrappy and resourceful. But as a result, they may be wary of humans that have not earned their trust.","care-nutrition":"Street dog diets typically consist of whatever they can kill or find—small farm animals, scraps from trash cans, handouts from kind strangers, and so on. If you're leaving food out for a street dog, they'll benefit from commercial diets formulated for pet dogs.\n\nBecause they fend for themselves, street dogs aren't usually at risk of becoming overweight. However, if you take a street dog under your roof, keep an eye on their food intake to avoid overfeeding. Guidelines on dog food packages are a good starting point when determining daily portions.\n","care-grooming":"If you've adopted a street dog that's comfortable being handled, regular brushing and nail trims will help them look their best. Good [dental hygiene](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) is also important for any dog.

first known photograph of a tailless cat dates back to 1810. But other clues suggest they may have existed since as early as 1750.\n\nMany fanciful legends attempt to explain why these cats are tailless. But the true story is simple: A genetic mutation caused kittens on the Isle of Man to be born without normal tails.\n\nBecause the gene that results in taillessness is dominant, it spread quickly among cats on the island. Occasionally, some were born with tails, which still happens today.\n\nThe population of tailless cats split into short and longhaired varieties. (The longhair gene was likely introduced during Viking rule—when ancestors of the Norwegian Forest Cat came to the island.) The shorthair cats, called Manx, received mainstream recognition long before the longhair Cymric. But both share the same breed standard.","facts":"Cymrics are intelligent, playful cats that show their people \"dog-like\" loyalty. They get along well with other pets and kids, and they're often the household clowns.","traits-appearance":"Cymrics are medium-sized cats with an overall round appearance. They're heavy and muscular, with a well-balanced, compact structure.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Cymric's dense, medium-length double coat has a soft, silky texture and a glossy appearance. The hair on the breeches, stomach, and neck ruff is longer than that of the main body. Some Cymrics also have toe tufts and ear tufts. The breed comes in all coat colors and combinations and often displays dramatic markings.","traits-physical":"Cymric have large, round heads and chubby cheeks. Their medium ears are wide at the base and taper slightly to a point. The color of their round, full eyes corresponds with their coat color. And their powerful back legs are much longer than their front—causing their rumps to sit noticeably higher than their shoulders.\n\nIf a cat has a full-length tail, they're called a \"longie.\" If they have a nub or stump, they're called a \"stumpie.\" Completely tailless cats go by \"rumpie.\" And rumpies with a rise of bone at the end of their spine are called \"risers.\"","temperament":"Cymrics are calm and social cats that make devoted family pets. They're very people-oriented and don't like being left alone for long periods. If your schedule takes you away from home for hours every day, consider getting your Cymric a \"sibling\" cat for company.\n\nThis intelligent breed can figure out how to open doors or cabinets if they think there is something of interest on the other side. They also have a sense of humor and have been known to play tricks on their humans. But most of the time, Cymrics are mellow, easy-going cats that like to follow their people around while chatting with their sweet, quiet voices.\n\nWith powerful hind legs, Cymrics can jump high, accelerate quickly, and perform rapid turns—all skills that make these kitties entertaining playmates. They love to chase, pounce, and play with interactive toys. These natural hunters will also guarantee their home never has a mouse problem.","care-nutrition":"Cymrics require a high-quality diet to meet their nutritional needs. Because those needs vary for kittens, adults, and senior cats, opt for a formula that's age-appropriate for your pet.\n\nTo keep your cat at a healthy weight, measure out meals and reduce portions if necessary. And keep an eye on how many snacks you're giving them—just one ounce of cheese can account for half their recommended daily calories. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of a cat's caloric intake.\n\nLastly, all cats need access to fresh, clean water around the clock.","care-grooming":"Cymrics require weekly brushing to look their best. During periods of seasonal shedding, they may need even more frequent brushing.\n\nMost cats' nails require monthly trimming to prevent them from getting too long. Long nails are more likely to snag on something and become torn or damaged. They can even grow into your cat's paw pads, leading to pain or infection. In addition to clipping, providing a scratching post will allow your cat to do some nail maintenance themselves (thanks to their instinct to scratch).\n\nGood dental hygiene is essential to a Cymric's overall health. An ideal dental routine includes daily at-home teeth brushing combined with visits to the veterinarian for professional dental cleanings and exams.","care-exercise":null,"care-training":null,"care-health":"The genetic mutation that causes taillessness can also cause other health complications—including spinal cord or nerve damage, bladder or bowels problems, and digestive issues.

Though the latter is better known (and much more common), Irish Red and White Setters are actually the older of the two breeds, dating back to the 1600s.\n\nInitially bred for their field talents rather than coat colors, Irish Red and White Setters proved to be natural pointers with the stamina and intensity to hunt all day long. As the breed evolved, increasing amounts of red appeared in their coats, with some dogs being entirely red.\n\nIn the 1800s, the red coloring grew more popular in the show ring. As a result, the all-red setters gradually became the most prominent variety. However, a public outcry to save the breed's traditional red and white color helped the Irish Red and White Setter survive.\n\nThe American Kennel Club accepted the breed in 1996 and awarded it full recognition in 2009. Today, only about 500 Irish Red and White Setters are in North America. And the breed still typically serves more as a field dog than a house dog. But when properly trained, the Irish Red and White Setter makes an obedient and loyal pet.","facts":"The Irish Red and White Setter is a high-spirited, fun-loving breed. Field dogs through and through, Irish Red and White Setters are athletic and determined, with natural pointing abilities. It's no wonder hunters have considered the breed a valuable companion for centuries.","traits-appearance":"Bred for work in the field, the Irish Red and White Setter is strong, powerful, well-balanced, and athletic.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Irish Red and White Setter has long, silky feathering on the ears, back of legs, and tail. Likewise, the breed has feathering on the chest and throat that forms a fringe. On all other parts of the body, the hair is short and flat, with no curl.\n\nAs its name suggests, the Irish Red and White Setter's coat is white with solid red patches. The red color varies in shade from light honey to rich chestnut. It has flecking around the face, feet, and up the foreleg.","traits-physical":"Irish Red and White Setters have broad heads and clean, square muzzles. Dark hazel or dark brown eyes offer a gentle, kind expression. The well-feathered tail is moderately long and tapers to a fine point.","temperament":"Intelligent and lively, Irish Red and White Setters thrive among families with active, outdoorsy lifestyles. These dogs are devoted and affectionate toward all members of their packs—including kids and other pets.\n\nIrish Red and White Setters are fairly obedient and easy to housebreak. But they're also very independent. So, this breed can be a handful if not given plenty of exercise and consistent training.","care-nutrition":"Irish Red and White Setters require high-quality food that's appropriate for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). A diet specifically formulated for the energy needs of active, medium-breed dogs is a great option to consider.\n\nIrish Red and White Setters are at greater risk of bloat (also known as twisted stomach). To help prevent bloat, break their food up into several meals a day, and use a food bowl designed to slow their rate of eating. Avoid timing meals immediately after any kind of vigorous activity, and wait at least an hour before allowing your dog to run or exercise.\n\nThese are just a few ways you can help prevent this life-threatening condition. A veterinarian is the best resource for other recommendations—including surgical options—for preventing bloat.\n\nTo keep your Irish Red and White Setter at a healthy weight, monitor their food intake carefully. You can avoid overfeeding by measuring out their meals. And don't forget to count calories from treats in their daily totals. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of a dog's calories.","care-grooming":"Grooming an Irish Red and White Setter is a fairly low-maintenance job. Brush them once a week with a soft brush, and use a comb to work out any tangles.\n\nBecause Irish Red and White Setters have long ears, they may be more susceptible to ear infections. For this reason, check and clean their ears regularly to prevent infections from developing.\n\nMaintaining good [dental hygiene](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) is essential for the overall long-term health of all dogs. In addition to professional dental cleanings, establish an at-home dental care routine that includes regular teeth brushing.","care-exercise":"Irish Red and White Setters need more exercise than most dogs. Daily long walks, runs, or hikes are all great activities to try. Alternatively, take advantage of the breed's intelligence, stamina, and instincts with competitive obedience and field trials.","care-training":"The Irish Red and White Setter's high-spirited temperament and stubborn streak can make it a challenging breed to train. Use short, upbeat training sessions to keep them engaged. Gentle persuasion and motivational tools such as treats and favorite toys may also be helpful.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/lifestyle/5-reasons-irish-red-and-white-setter/\n\nhttps://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/irish-red-and-white-setter/\n\nhttps://www.irishredwhitesetterassociation.com/breed-history.htm\n\nhttp://www.fci.be/Nomenclature/Standards/330g07-en.pdf\n\nhttp://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/IrishRedWhiteSetter.pdf","reviewed-by":"Annette Louviere, DVM","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":20.9,"weight-range-pet-max":38.6,"weight-range-show-min":22.7,"weight-range-show-max":34.0,"height-range-min":56.0,"height-range-max":66.0,"life-span-range-min":11.0,"life-span-range-max":15.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":101,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":65,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":43},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/486fdf03-8671-551c-ab49-8578f886c4c5/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/486fdf03-8671-551c-ab49-8578f886c4c5/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/486fdf03-8671-551c-ab49-8578f886c4c5/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/486fdf03-8671-551c-ab49-8578f886c4c5/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/486fdf03-8671-551c-ab49-8578f886c4c5/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/486fdf03-8671-551c-ab49-8578f886c4c5/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/486fdf03-8671-551c-ab49-8578f886c4c5/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/486fdf03-8671-551c-ab49-8578f886c4c5/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/486fdf03-8671-551c-ab49-8578f886c4c5/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/486fdf03-8671-551c-ab49-8578f886c4c5/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/486fdf03-8671-551c-ab49-8578f886c4c5/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/486fdf03-8671-551c-ab49-8578f886c4c5/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/486fdf03-8671-551c-ab49-8578f886c4c5/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/486fdf03-8671-551c-ab49-8578f886c4c5/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/486fdf03-8671-551c-ab49-8578f886c4c5/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/486fdf03-8671-551c-ab49-8578f886c4c5/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/486fdf03-8671-551c-ab49-8578f886c4c5/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/486fdf03-8671-551c-ab49-8578f886c4c5/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"4893a174-baff-594c-9fe4-bd41c7e01034","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4893a174-baff-594c-9fe4-bd41c7e01034"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"street-dog-fiji","name":"Fijian Street Dog","plural-name":"Fijian Street Dogs","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"Like all dogs, the Fijian street dog is a descendant of the gray wolf. At some point, a number of wolves became domesticated (but experts disagree on exactly when and how). And over time, it became clear that these domesticated canines could perform many useful jobs—from pulling sleds to herding sheep to protecting livestock.\n\nAs a result, people began selectively breeding them to strengthen the traits that made them excel in specific areas or conditions. This effort resulted in the many purebred dogs that we know and love today. But the majority of dogs around the world do not belong to a particular breed. This includes Fijian street dogs.\n\nThese semi-feral dogs wander the streets, primarily in Fiji's two cities: Suva and Lautoka. The street dog population has increased over the years, impacting local communities. As concerns about cleanliness, disease transmission, and public safety intensify, local governments for the island nation have implemented programs to keep the street dog population under control. Trap, neuter, release (TNR) programs have shown promise in reducing the number of free-roaming dogs in Fiji's city streets.","facts":"Fijian street dogs are free-roaming pups that typically congregate in cities or towns with plentiful resources. They share many basic traits with pet dogs, but they lead primarily independent lives outdoors.","traits-appearance":"Fijian street dogs can come in all shapes and sizes. But street dogs generally tend to be medium-sized.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Street dogs typically have short, brownish coats. That said, any combination of coat colors, patterns, and lengths is genetically possible.","traits-physical":"Fijian street dogs do not follow a breed standard, so there is no shared set of traits that links them together. Still, common characteristics of street dogs include prick ears and pointed noses.","temperament":"Fijian street dogs have learned to fend for themselves. So, they tend to be scrappy, intelligent, and adaptable—all skills that support independent survival. Because they've never had to rely on humans, they may be fearful or skeptical of people who have not earned their trust.","care-nutrition":"Fijian street dogs' diets typically consist of whatever they can kill or find—small farm animals, scraps from trash cans, handouts from kind strangers, and so on. If you're leaving food out for a street dog, they'll benefit from commercial diets formulated for pet dogs.\n\nBecause they fend for themselves, street dogs aren't usually at risk of becoming overweight. However, if you take a street dog under your roof, keep an eye on their food intake to avoid overfeeding. Guidelines on dog food packages are a good starting point when determining daily portions.","care-grooming":"If you've adopted a street dog that's comfortable being handled, regular brushing and nail trims will help them look their best. Good [dental hygiene](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) is also important for any dog. Professional cleanings and at-home dental care will keep their mouths healthy and reduce the risk of related health issues.","care-exercise":"All dogs need exercise to stay physically and mentally fit, and street dogs are no exception. Fijian street dogs that are on their own will get adequate exercise during their daily roaming. Pet dogs, however, need access to the outdoors to stretch their legs and get mental stimulation. Playing in a fenced yard and going for leashed walks are great ways for your dog to release energy.","care-training":"Street dogs are not accustomed to obeying commands from people. In fact, many may avoid close contact with humans. Before attempting a training program, start by building trust and respect with your dog.

Dating all the way back to ancient Antiquity, these dogs were used to hunt the ancient wild elk of Ireland.\n\nAs wolves became more of a nuisance in Ireland in the 15th century, Irish Wolfhounds became specialized in hunting wolves, which is when their name became the Wolfhound. Sadly, after the breed effectively hunted their prey to extinction, the Wolfhound fell out of use, and they too almost went extinct as a breed.\n\nIrish Wolfhounds were saved in 1862 by a captain in the British army, George Augustus Graham. It became his primary ambition to save the breed, which he did by gathering all of the known living dogs he could find. His name still receives high praise from any avid Irish Wolfhound fans.","facts":"A large, powerful sighthound, the Irish Wolfhound is a superb athlete. Despite its size, this breed is quite calm and loving, considering its potential to stand three feet tall and up to 180 lbs. Each Irish Wolfhound has an individual personality, but in general they provide rewarding companionship when cared for properly.","traits-appearance":"Males have the potential to reach almost three feet tall and 180 pounds, with females not far behind.

Built with the distinct curves of a large muscular Greyhound, the Irish Wolfhound looks like a natural born athlete.","temperament":"Despite this breed’s great size, the Irish Wolfhound is a gentle and dignified dog. They offer a wonderful, comforting element to any family, responding best to a loving, sensitive environment. The breed’s individual and intelligent personalities require constant human companionship, and they do not do well if crated daily by a busy owner.","care-nutrition":"Irish Wolfhounds require a high-quality dog food that is age-appropriate—whether it’s commercially manufactured or homemade (with a veterinarian’s supervision and approval). As with any dog, it’s important to monitor the amount of food and treats that you give your Irish Wolfhound, especially since they are prone to gaining weight as they age. Reduce the portions or restrict calories if your pup gains weight.\n\nIt is important to note that this breed can be susceptible to bloat. To help prevent bloat, break their food up into several meals a day, and use a food bowl that’s specially designed to slow their rate of eating. When timing meals, avoid feeding them immediately after any kind of vigorous activity, and wait at least an hour after meals before allowing them to run or exercise. These are just a few of ways you can help prevent this life-threatening condition. A veterinarian is the best resource for other recommendations, including surgical options, for preventing bloat.","care-grooming":"The Irish Wolfhound has a wiry coat that requires weekly grooming. They do have a tendency to shed, but not quite as bad as other breeds. Baths are also important.\n\nAll dogs require regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care), including at-home teeth brushing and professional dental cleanings, and Irish Wolfhound is no exception. Maintaining good dental hygiene is important for their overall long-term health.","care-exercise":"Daily exercise is essential to a healthy and happy Irish Wolfhound. Having a large, fenced area for them to gallop around in is also extremely important. They will give chase to anything they see, so they must be kept on a leash in an open environment. They also enjoy dog sports like lure coursing and tracking.","care-training":"They can be troublemakers as puppies, and they don’t mature until a year and a half or older. Irish Wolfhounds need a large space to roam and play. They are incredibly smart and will take to training well. They adore their human companions, and prove well suited as therapy dogs.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/irish-wolfhound/\n\nhttps://www.iwclubofamerica.org/about-irish-wolfhounds\n\nhttp://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/IrishWolfhound.pdf","reviewed-by":"Annette

Terrier","plural-name":"Bull Terriers","published-at":null,"species":"dog","history":"In the 1830s, bullfighting enthusiasts wanted dogs with greater agility. To meet this demand, breeders began developing the Bull Terrier. They crossed Old English Bulldog and Old English Terrier and threw Spanish Pointer into the mix, too. But the resulting breed didn’t perform as well as bullfighting enthusiasts had hoped, and the Bull Terrier’s popularity as a bullfighter decreased.\n\nFortunately, their popularity as a pet increased. When breeders produced an all-white Bull Terrier in the 1850s, people immediately adored the breed. And over the years, people have tried adding [Dalmatian](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/dalmatian), [Greyhound](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/greyhound), [Foxhound](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/american-foxhound), and [Whippet](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/whippet) into the Bull Terrier bloodline.\n\nStill extremely popular in both the United States and Europe, Bull Terriers have proven to be excellent guard dogs. The Bull Terrier Club started in 1887 in England. And eight years later, the breed received American Kennel Club recognition.","facts":"The Bull Terrier is a brave, strong, and intelligent breed. Though gentle with their families, Bull Terriers can be too rambunctious around younger children. They’re incredibly active and loving dogs. And thanks to their undying devotion, affection, and protective character, they make excellent pets.","traits-appearance":"Bull Terriers are hearty and big-boned—yet agile and powerful—dogs that move about in a carefree manner. They have full, round bodies with muscular shoulders.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Bull Terrier coats are short and stiff. They may be all-white or a myriad of colors, including black, tan, and brindle.","traits-physical":"A long, oval-shaped head, upright and pointed ears, and small, triangular eyes are signature characteristics of the Bull Terrier.","temperament":"Bull Terriers typically have playful personalities. They’re charming and can be mischievous—in an almost clownish or comical way. Though they can be headstrong at times, Bull Terriers make loyal, lifelong companions.\n\nThese dogs are usually good with other pets. But they may be unpredictable or unfriendly toward unfamiliar animals. Interaction with strangers, however, shouldn’t be a problem. Bull Terriers are very sociable dogs, and they quickly accept others if introduced appropriately.\n\nBull Terriers can become destructive if left home alone for long periods. They may also develop food aggression in multi-pet households. But with proper supervision and training, they usually get along well with other animals in the home. Because of their stubborn and independent nature, Bull Terriers require patient, reward-based training methods.","care-nutrition":"Bull Terriers need a high-quality diet that is age-appropriate. As puppies, their food should include a natural source of calcium. During periods of rapid growth and bone development, you can also meet this need with high-calcium treats (e.g., yogurt, whole milk, broccoli).\n\nThis breed is prone to weight problems. So, take care with the amount of food you give your Bull Terrier, and reduce portions if your pup gains weight. Also, remember that too many treats, in addition to regular meals, can cause obesity.","care-grooming":"The Bull Terrier’s coat requires little maintenance to stay in tip-top shape. Weekly brushing with a soft-bristle brush, hound glove, or rubber grooming mitt/tool will help remove loose hair.\n\nAs with all breeds, regular nail trimming is a must for Bull Terriers. Overly long nails can cause the dog pain, and may even contribute to walking and running problems.","care-exercise":"Bull Terriers like to play and require moderate amounts of physical exercise and mental stimulation. Long walks around the neighborhood with the family or active games should do the trick. Bull Terriers make good jogging partners, too.\n\nBecause of their great strength and ability, Bull Terriers also tend to enjoy canine sports that involve obedience, tracking, agility, and coursing ability tests.","care-training":"Both [early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) and gentle (but firm) training are essential for bringing out the Bull Terrier’s best qualities. This breed often prefers frivolous and fun activities over working dog jobs. That said, Bull Terriers do well as bomb detection dogs, search-and-rescue dogs, service dogs, assistance dogs, health-alert dogs, and therapy dogs.\n\nA great way to [start a training

Fauve de Bretagne","plural-name":"Griffons Fauves de Bretagne","published-at":"2023-09-19T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The Griffon Fauve de Bretagne dates back to 14th century France. One of the oldest French scent hounds, this breed primarily hunted wolves. When the wolf population disappeared, these dogs used their talents to hunt fox, wild boar, roe deer, and hare.\n\nLeading up to World War II, only a few Breton farmers and hunters still kept this breed. Marcel Pambrun founded the Club de Fauve de Bretagne in 1949 to preserve the breed, along with a short-legged breed derived from it, the [Basset Fauve de Bretagne](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/basset-fauve-de-bretagne). The Griffon Fauve de Bretagne is still considered a rare breed outside of France.","facts":"The Griffon Fauve de Bretagne is both talented and good-looking. With a keen sense of smell and a solid work ethic, these dogs make excellent hunters. And their rich, golden color makes them stand out in every family photo.","traits-appearance":"The Fauve de Bretagne is a bony, muscular dog that's resistant to cold weather and performs well on rugged terrain.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"This breed has a short, rough, and harsh coat. The coat is never curly or wooly, and the hair on the face is not as profuse, with softer hair on the ears. Their fawn-colored coats range from golden wheaten to brick red. Some have a white star on the chest, and they can occasionally have a few black hairs on the head or ears. Their nose can be black or brown.","traits-physical":"The Fauve de Bretagne has dark brown eyes and a lively expression. Their ears reach the end of their nose when pulled forward. These dogs have well-muscled legs and carry their medium-length tail in a sickle fashion. They are known for their strong bark, which is short and repeated (and used often).","temperament":"The Griffon Fauve de Bretagne is a good-natured dog that's affectionate and social with people. Still, their preference is to spend their days doing what they do best: hunting. ","care-nutrition":"This breed does well on high-quality dog food formulated for their age, size, and activity level. To help them maintain a healthy weight, measure their meals to avoid overfeeding and keep treats to 10% or less of their daily calories.","care-grooming":"The Griffon Fauve de Bretagne's short coat is relatively easy to maintain. Regular brushing to remove loose fur and dirt will keep them looking sharp. Additionally, regular ear checks, nail trims, and [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) should be part of their grooming routine.","care-exercise":"These active dogs have plenty of energy and stamina. They require daily walks or vigorous backyard play sessions—ideally totaling two hours a day. Better yet, take them on long hikes with plenty of sniffing opportunities so they can exercise their noses, too.","care-training":"Temper any stubborn tendencies by using consistent, firm training techniques. In addition, these dogs respond well to positive reinforcement using treats or favorite toys as rewards for desired behaviors.\n\nIn addition to obedience training, all breeds benefit from [early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization). Helping them feel comfortable with different people and environments when they're young will help them grow into well-adjusted adult dogs.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.fci.be/Nomenclature/Standards/066g06-en.pdf\n\nhttps://www.centrale-canine.fr/le-chien-de-race/griffon-fauve-de-bretagne\n\nhttp://clubdufauvedebretagne.fr/\n\nhttps://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/breed-standards/hound/griffon-fauve-de-bretagne-imp/","reviewed-by":"Casey Knox, DVM","date-reviewed":"2023-07-11T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":23.0,"weight-range-pet-max":23.0,"weight-range-show-min":23.0,"weight-range-show-max":23.0,"height-range-min":48.0,"height-range-max":58.0,"life-span-range-min":10.0,"life-span-range-max":14.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":null,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":null,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":null},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4c389513-4521-5408-8093-1832488b9845/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4c389513-4521-5408-8093-1832488b9845/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4c389513-4521-5408-8093-1832488b9845/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4c389513-4521-5408-8093-1832488b9845/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4c389513-4521-5408-8093-1832488b9845/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4c389513-4521-5408-8093-1832488b9845/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4c389513-4521-5408-8093-1832488b9845/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4c389513-4521-5408-8093-1832488b9845/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4c389513-4521-5408-8093-1832488b9845/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4c389513-4521-5408-8093-1832488b9845/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4c389513-4521-5408-8093-1832488b9845/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4c389513-4521-5408-8093-1832488b9845/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4c389513-4521-5408-8093-1832488b9845/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4c389513-4521-5408-8093-1832488b9845/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4c389513-4521-5408-8093-1832488b9845/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4c389513-4521-5408-8093-1832488b9845/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4c389513-4521-5408-8093-1832488b9845/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4c389513-4521-5408-8093-1832488b9845/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"4c8bece7-5699-4edf-87bd-3afa6a5ebdff","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4c8bece7-5699-4edf-87bd-3afa6a5ebdff"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":false,"country-codes":["GB"],"slug":"domestic-cat-uk","name":"British Domestic Cat","plural-name":null,"published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"cat","history":"Despite the growing number of cat breeds in the world, the non-pedigreed Domestic cats hold the top spot when it comes to popularity. British Domestic cats, often called moggies, are random-bred cats that have been delighting pet owners in Britain for centuries.\n\nExperts believe Roman armies brought the first cats to the island nearly 2,000 years ago. These cats became regular features on British streets. That is, until the Middle Ages when cats became associated with witchcraft. Suspicious locals rid their towns of cats, and the cat population significantly decreased.\n\nBritish Domestic cats returned to good graces in the 1500s after the plague ravaged cities and towns. People then realized that cats' keen rat-hunting skills were a weapon against disease-spreading vermin. As a result, the popularity of these cats grew once again—this time for good.\n\nThough British Domestics aren't purebred cats, some cat associations allow them to compete in shows in a general \"housecat\" category.","facts":"British Domestic cats come in all shapes and sizes. There's no rule book for these kitties, but one thing is certain: there's bound to be a Domestic that's perfect for you.","traits-appearance":"British Domestics come in a wide range of colors, sizes, and builds. Still, they're typically medium-sized and well-balanced.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"These cats can come in all coat colors, patterns, and lengths. If a coat combination is genetically possible, you're likely to see it in a British Domestic.","traits-physical":"British Domestics don't have a defined breed standard. The typical Domestic may display any number of adorable features.","temperament":"Don't try to pin these cats down when it comes to personality. They can be quiet or vocal, cuddly or aloof. Getting to know a Domestic's unique personality is part of what makes them a fun household addition.\n\nBritish Domestics are typically athletic cats with strong hunting instincts. Using feather wands and other toys they can pounce on or chase gives them a much-needed outlet for their natural tendencies.\n\nDomestics also tend to enjoy keeping an eye on the outside world. High perches where they can safely look out at birds and other wildlife will keep them entertained for hours.","care-nutrition":"British Domestic cats thrive on a high-quality diet. Because nutritional needs vary for kittens, adults, and senior cats, choose a formula that's age-appropriate for your pet.\n\nTo prevent overfeeding, carefully measure portions and reduce amounts if your cat gains excess weight. And keep an eye on how many treats you're giving them. As a guideline, treats should be kept to 10% of a cat's daily calories or less.\n\nIn addition to meals, provide your cat with plenty of fresh, clean water.","care-grooming":"These kitties are typically excellent self-groomers. Still, they need regular brushing to keep their coats looking their best. Weekly brushing is usually enough for shorthaired cats. Longhaired cats are more prone to tangles and mats and may require daily brushing.\n\nIn addition to combing, trim their claws monthly to prevent overgrowth. Overgrown nails are more likely to snag on something, become torn or damaged, or even grow into the paw pads—leading to pain or infection. In addition to clipping, a scratching post will help keep your cat's nails in good shape and satisfy their instinct to scratch.\n\nFinally, all cats need regular dental care—including at-home teeth brushing and professional dental exams and cleanings.","care-exercise":null,"care-training":null,"care-health":"Obesity is a growing concern in cats. Extra weight can contribute to other health risks, such as arthritis, diabetes, and heart problems.

Lapphund","plural-name":"Swedish Lapphunds","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"Originating in the North Arctic Circle, the Swedish Lapphund is one of the world's oldest dog breeds. It's also one of three Lapphund breeds developed by the Sami people to hunt (and later guard and herd) reindeer.\n\nAs demand for these dogs' reindeer skills dwindled, Lappies largely transitioned from working dogs to faithful companions—a role they performed equally well. Still, their numbers began to decline. And in the mid-20th century, the breed faced extinction. Several breeders stepped up to save the Swedish Lapphund, but it remains a rare breed today.\n\nThe United Kennel Club recognized the Swedish Lapphund in 2006. The following year, the American Kennel Club added the breed to the Foundation Stock Service program.","facts":"The Swedish Lapphund is a friendly, energetic, alert breed. These affectionate pups love to spend time with their humans and make excellent pets for active families.","traits-appearance":"The Swedish Lapphund is a slightly less than medium-sized, spitz-type dog with a water-repellent coat.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Lappie has a thick, medium-length double coat. The hair on the outer coat stands straight off the body, and the undercoat is dense and finely curled. The breed also has a ruff around the neck and longer hair on the brisket and backside of the legs. These dogs' coats are typically solid black. But some bronzing of the coat is common. Lappies may also have white on their chests, feet, and tip of their tail.","traits-physical":"This breed has relatively large, round eyes and triangular prick ears with slightly rounded tips. Lappies also have strong, muscular backs and bushy tails that they carry over their backs when moving.","temperament":"Kind, affectionate dogs, Lappies have a playful, lively personality and love to be included in family activities. Though they need daily outlets for their energy, they're also more than happy to curl up with their people when it's time to relax.\n\nSwedish Lapphunds worked as herding and guard dogs for centuries, and the qualities that made them successful in those jobs remain. That means they're alert and always willing to work. It also means they tend to bark if they want to get your attention.","care-nutrition":"The Swedish Lapphund thrives on a high-quality diet formulated for their life stage. To keep your dog at a healthy weight, measure their portions to avoid overfeeding and keep an eye on how many treats you're giving them. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of a pup's daily calories.","care-grooming":"For most of the year, weekly brushing is enough to maintain a Lappie's coat. But once or twice a year, these dogs blow their coats. And the amount of fur they shed is excessive, to say the least. Brushing more frequently during these periods will help keep loose fur under control. Also, keep in mind that you should never shave the Lapphund's coat—it must be kept at its natural length year-round.\n\nRegular ear cleanings and nail trims should also be part of every dog's grooming routine. And don't forget about [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care). Dental disease is one of the most common health conditions in adult dogs. Left untreated, it can contribute to other serious issues. In addition to professional cleanings, establish an at-home dental care program that includes regular teeth brushing and veterinarian-recommended dental chews.","care-exercise":"An energetic breed, the Swedish Lapphund needs daily exercise to stay happy and healthy. These pups enjoy brisk walks, hikes, and chasing around the backyard.

Pomeranian dogs were originally known as Zwergspitz. Zwerg means \"dwarf,\" and \"spitz\" is the German breed of its bigger ancestor.\n\nAround 1850, the breed came to England, where it received the name \"Pomeranian\" in honor of its homeland. Twenty years later, the English Kennel Club officially recognized the breed. At that time, Pomeranians were much larger than the breed standard we know today. Picture a Golden Retriever with a bushy tail, and you'll have a pretty good idea of how they looked.\n\nToday's more diminutive Pomeranian, or \"Pom\" as its lovingly nicknamed, was established when breeders set out to create a breed that was better suited for city living. Through selective breeding, English breeders were finally able to produce a dog that weighed less than 20 pounds. Today's breed standard of around five pounds demonstrates just how much the breed has evolved.\n\nQueen Victoria had a lot to do with the initial popularity of these small Pomeranians. In 1888, she received one of these \"pocket dogs\" as a gift, and she fell in love. The breed's association with the queen made it desirable all over the world. And by 1900, the AKC had officially recognized the Pomeranian.\n\nFast forward to today, and the Pomeranian's manageable size and feisty character have made it one of the most popular breeds in the world.","facts":"The Pomeranian is an active, friendly, and cheerful breed. These extroverted dogs are natural performers and like to learn tricks and entertain a crowd. A wonderful, very good-natured pet, this tiny dog is a big favorite.","traits-appearance":"The Pomeranian is a compact, short-backed dog with a luxurious coat. It has a smiling face and fox-like expression.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Pomeranian has a thick double coat. A short, dense undercoat covers the body while longer guard hair grows through, forming an abundant outer coat that puffs out around the shoulders and chest.\n\nAll colors are acceptable in the breed standard. Pomeranians may be black, brindle (black and brown striped), apricot, red, cream, sable, chocolate, or parti-color. White markings and a black mask are also possible.","traits-physical":"One of the Pomeranian's signature traits is a heavily plumed tail that's set high and lies flat on the back. They also have dark, bright, almond-shaped eyes that are set well into their skull. And a Pom's small, erect ears are mounted high on its head.","temperament":"Pomeranians are very confident, alert, and proud dogs that are ideal for both city living and suburban home life.\n\nPoms are gentle and playful by nature, but they also need to be treated with care. For this reason, they are best suited for families with relatively older children. They're also generally friendly towards other pets. However, Pomeranians can be reserved around strangers and may require careful socialization to prevent or reduce defensive-aggressive tendencies.\n\nDespite their small size, Poms make excellent watchdogs. But they do like to bark, so training should be provided from an early age to curb this tendency.","care-nutrition":"Toy dogs like Pomeranians require more calories per pound of body weight than larger dogs. To meet their nutritional needs, it's best to feed them several small meals throughout the day, because their small stomachs don't allow them to eat large meals.\n\nSome Pomeranians are prone to obesity, so it's important to keep a close eye on the amount of food they eat each day. To avoid accidental overfeeding, portion out their food using a measuring cup. And don't forget to account for treats when considering their daily calories. Even a couple of extra treats can add up for such a small dog. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of their calories each day.\n\nAs with all dogs, Poms should be fed a diet formulated for their specific life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). Experts also recommend that Pomeranians be fed a diet created for small-breed dogs. These diets have the appropriate blend of nutrients and a smaller kibble size that helps them properly chew and digest their food.","care-grooming":"Pomeranians have above-average grooming requirements. They need frequent brushing to keep their lavish coat healthy and beautiful. While you can achieve this at home using both a pin brush and a slicker brush, regular appointments with a professional groomer may be beneficial. Experts recommend a full groom—bathing, brushing, ear checks, nail trims, and anal glands—every 4-6 weeks.\n\nPomeranians are particularly susceptible to dental issues due to their small mouths and crowded teeth. All dogs require regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care)—including at-home preventive measures and professional dental cleanings. But Poms may require more frequent cleanings beginning at an earlier age.","care-exercise":"Though Pomeranians are active dogs that require regular exercise, their needs can often be met through indoor playtime or short strolls in the neighborhood.\n\nPoms also seem to enjoy dog sports such as agility, rally, and competitive obedience. Some Pomeranians even enjoy musical canine freestyle, which is a mix of obedience training, dance, and tricks. It's not only great exercise but also a fun way to interact with their owners.","care-training":"Pomeranians are very smart dogs. With consistent training, they can master a variety of tricks. [Housebreaking](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/potty-train-a-puppy) can be challenging, though some Poms can be trained to use indoor potty systems.\n\nThey're eager to learn and respond well to reward-based training using treats or favorite toys.","care-health":null,"references":"http://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/Pomeranian.pdf\n\nhttps://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/pomeranian/\n\nhttps://www.royalcanin.com/us/dogs/products/retail-products/small-adult-dry-dog-food\n\nhttps://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/dog-breeds/pomeranian","reviewed-by":"Annette Louviere, DVM","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":1.4,"weight-range-pet-max":4.5,"weight-range-show-min":1.4,"weight-range-show-max":3.2,"height-range-min":18.0,"height-range-max":30.0,"life-span-range-min":12.0,"life-span-range-max":16.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":78,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":46,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":35},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4d1e60d0-0f20-5325-b9f5-e8904ecb09d9/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4d1e60d0-0f20-5325-b9f5-e8904ecb09d9/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4d1e60d0-0f20-5325-b9f5-e8904ecb09d9/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4d1e60d0-0f20-5325-b9f5-e8904ecb09d9/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4d1e60d0-0f20-5325-b9f5-e8904ecb09d9/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4d1e60d0-0f20-5325-b9f5-e8904ecb09d9/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4d1e60d0-0f20-5325-b9f5-e8904ecb09d9/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4d1e60d0-0f20-5325-b9f5-e8904ecb09d9/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4d1e60d0-0f20-5325-b9f5-e8904ecb09d9/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4d1e60d0-0f20-5325-b9f5-e8904ecb09d9/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4d1e60d0-0f20-5325-b9f5-e8904ecb09d9/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4d1e60d0-0f20-5325-b9f5-e8904ecb09d9/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4d1e60d0-0f20-5325-b9f5-e8904ecb09d9/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4d1e60d0-0f20-5325-b9f5-e8904ecb09d9/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4d1e60d0-0f20-5325-b9f5-e8904ecb09d9/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4d1e60d0-0f20-5325-b9f5-e8904ecb09d9/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4d1e60d0-0f20-5325-b9f5-e8904ecb09d9/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4d1e60d0-0f20-5325-b9f5-e8904ecb09d9/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"4d4c3b84-0818-5e2e-8c9b-720229a8c0b5","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4d4c3b84-0818-5e2e-8c9b-720229a8c0b5"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"finnish-lapphund","name":"Finnish Lapphund","plural-name":"Finnish Lapphunds","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The Finnish Lapphund came from the Sami, or Lapp, people, a group that has inhabited the Lapland region of the north Arctic Circle for thousands of years. The Sami bred the original “Lapps’ dog,” a thick-coated pup used to hunt reindeer. These dogs had to be courageous and swift, which are all words that still describe the Finnish Lapphund today.\n\nOver time, Sami society evolved, and their canine companions changed with them. Eventually, these reindeer hunters became herders, while still acting as hunting dogs, guardians, and companions for their owners.\n\nThese days the Finnish Lapphund isn’t needed quite as much to herd reindeer, but their friendly companionship is still much appreciated by the Sami in frigid Arctic Circle.","facts":"The Finnish Lapphund, one of Finland’s most popular breeds, is faithful and friendly at home. These non-aggressive dogs are intelligent and gentle, making them wonderful family pets for people with kids or other dogs. This breed is excellent at herding reindeer. As pack dogs, they don’t like to be left alone and can bark or become destructive when they’re upset.","traits-appearance":"Although the Finnish Lapphund is considered a medium-sized dog, their ample coat often makes them appear larger.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Finnish Lapphund has a double coat, and although all shades are allowed, the most common include black and brown and grey tones. Some members of the breed may also have light or tan markings throughout.\n\nSimilar in look to breeds like the Siberian Husky and Samoyed, they are smaller versions with generally straight and smooth—although sometimes wavy—outer coats, with feathering on behind their legs, underneath their belly, and on their tail.","traits-physical":"The Finnish Lapphund has a strong and straight back, and although their head is powerful, their eyes are soft and soulful. Their triangular ears are set far apart on their head, while their hindquarters are straight and strong, full of power for a day of herding reindeer.","temperament":"Originally bred to herd reindeer, modern Finnish Lapphunds still possess the same poise, strength, and control of their predecessors.\n\nThey can be noisy when in pursuit of a hunt, and are always alert and watchful. Because of their hunting instinct, the Finnish Lapphund can be startled easily, though they always recover quickly to move on with their work.\n\nWhen they’re off-duty, the Finnish Lapphund is submissive and calm with their people, but they tend not to be shy. As pack dogs, they don’t like to be left alone for long periods.","care-nutrition":"Feed your Finnish Lapphund a high-quality dog food that’s suited to their particular age and activity level, as well as any additional health concerns.\n\nAs with any dog, it’s important to monitor the amount of food and treats that you give your Finnish Lapphund to avoid having them gain weight, especially as they age. Your veterinarian is always a good source to help provide you with appropriate nutrition and feeding guidelines.","care-grooming":"Although the Finnish Lapphund does have a thick double coat, their fur requires minimal care. When they are young, the breed’s coat may require more attention and combing, but once their adult fur comes in and the texture changes, regular, once-weekly grooming should be enough to keep it in good shape.\n\nAll dogs require regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care), including at-home teeth brushing and professional dental cleanings, and the Finnish Lapphund is no exception. Maintaining good dental hygiene is important for their overall long-term health.","care-exercise":"The Finnish Lapphund is a relatively calm breed. But, because of their hunting background, they have moderate exercise requirements. Daily walks or a quick game of fetch in a (secure) backyard will do.\n\nSince they are a herding breed, Finnish Lapphunds also enjoy herding trials or other dog sports like agility and tracking.","care-training":"As is the case with most herding breeds, the Finnish Lapphund is intelligent and can be a fast learner, but they may also have a stubborn and independent streak, which can make training difficult.\n\nEarly and proper training can help limit some of the undesirable attributes of the breed, though. For example, as a pack dog, they don’t like to be left alone, so when they get lonely or bored, this breed may bark or exhibit destructive behavior.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/finnish-lapphund/\n\nhttps://www.finnishlapphund.org/lappie.php\n\nhttps://www.finnishlapphund-club.co.uk/about-the-breed\n\nhttp://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/Finnish_Lapphund.pdf","reviewed-by":"Cindy Elston, DVM, MPH","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":15.0,"weight-range-pet-max":24.0,"weight-range-show-min":15.0,"weight-range-show-max":24.0,"height-range-min":41.0,"height-range-max":53.0,"life-span-range-min":12.0,"life-span-range-max":15.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":109,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":70,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":46},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4d4c3b84-0818-5e2e-8c9b-720229a8c0b5/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4d4c3b84-0818-5e2e-8c9b-720229a8c0b5/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4d4c3b84-0818-5e2e-8c9b-720229a8c0b5/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4d4c3b84-0818-5e2e-8c9b-720229a8c0b5/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4d4c3b84-0818-5e2e-8c9b-720229a8c0b5/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4d4c3b84-0818-5e2e-8c9b-720229a8c0b5/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4d4c3b84-0818-5e2e-8c9b-720229a8c0b5/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4d4c3b84-0818-5e2e-8c9b-720229a8c0b5/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4d4c3b84-0818-5e2e-8c9b-720229a8c0b5/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4d4c3b84-0818-5e2e-8c9b-720229a8c0b5/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4d4c3b84-0818-5e2e-8c9b-720229a8c0b5/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4d4c3b84-0818-5e2e-8c9b-720229a8c0b5/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4d4c3b84-0818-5e2e-8c9b-720229a8c0b5/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4d4c3b84-0818-5e2e-8c9b-720229a8c0b5/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4d4c3b84-0818-5e2e-8c9b-720229a8c0b5/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4d4c3b84-0818-5e2e-8c9b-720229a8c0b5/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4d4c3b84-0818-5e2e-8c9b-720229a8c0b5/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4d4c3b84-0818-5e2e-8c9b-720229a8c0b5/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"4e07c230-5582-5169-9891-b299199afc57","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4e07c230-5582-5169-9891-b299199afc57"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"american-eskimo-dog","name":"American Eskimo Dog","plural-name":"American Eskimo Dogs","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"You might be surprised to know that the American Eskimo does not actually hail from Arctic climates. Instead, German immigrants living in the American Midwest developed the breed. Though once known as [the German Spitz](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/german-spitz), this breed's name changed to reflect anti-German sentiment in the United States during World War I.\n\nAmerican Eskimo Dogs served on the farm as herders, hunters, guardians, and companions. But the fun-loving breed also found fame performing tricks in traveling circuses and vaudeville troops. In the 1930s, an American Eskimo Dog named Pierre made headlines and captured hearts as a tightrope walker with the Barnum & Bailey Circus.","facts":"The American Eskimo Dog is active, outgoing, and quick to learn new tasks. With a playful nature and eager-to-please personality, Eskies make excellent (and adorable) four-legged family members.","traits-appearance":"This small-to-medium-sized Nordic dog has a compact, balanced build, erect, triangular-shaped ears, and thick white hair. American Eskimo Dogs come in three sizes: toy, miniature, and standard. All varieties have a smooth gait and keen, alert expression.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The American Eskimo Dog has a stand-off double coat with a dense undercoat and longer outer coat with no curl or wave. A pronounced ruff around the neck, short, smooth hair around the muzzle, and significant feathering on the legs are hallmarks of the breed. Eskies have two possible coat colors: white or white with biscuit cream.","traits-physical":"The American Eskimo is longer than it is tall. The breed has a deep chest, broad back, muscular loins, triangular, blunt-tipped ears, and slightly oval eyes. Its lips, nose, and eye rims form distinctive black points on its white face.","temperament":"The American Eskimo Dog is a natural performer and quick to learn. However, this breed can also be conservative and guarded in unfamiliar situations or with unknown people. Eskies may be small, but they have big barks. They alert their people to a stranger's arrival, but Eskies are never aggressive or threatening. The breed can be vocal and might not be the best option for apartment life.\n\nDue to their quick, curious natures, Eskies need a lot of exercise and mental stimulation. A quick walk around the block is not enough to satisfy their desire to explore. Providing American Eskimo Dogs with a fenced yard to roam and lots of different toys to play with can help channel their energy in positive directions. Without adequate stimulation, the breed can become bored and destructive.\n\nEskies form strong relationships with their owners. They are kid-friendly canines that are happiest spending time with their people. Keep these pups engaged by playing games of fetch or teaching them new tricks.","care-nutrition":"American Eskimo Dogs need a high-quality dog food that's appropriate for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). A diet specially formulated for small breeds is a good option to consider. To help them stay at a healthy weight, measure out meals to avoid overfeeding, and make sure treats contribute to no more than 10% of your dog's daily calories.","care-grooming":"Though their sleek white coats are easy to maintain, Eskies are constant shedders. Brushing an American Eskimo Dog several times per week can help remove dead hair and prevent matting. Professional grooming is not required, but a decent vacuum is.\n\nAvoid bathing your Eskie too often. Their skin has natural oils that repel dirt, and frequent bathing can dry out their skin, making it itchy and irritated.\n\nAll dogs require regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care)—including at-home teeth brushing and professional dental cleanings. Maintaining good dental hygiene is essential for your pup's overall long-term health. So, it's best to start during puppyhood to make it a lifelong habit.","care-exercise":"American Eskimo Dogs have boundless energy. In addition to taking regular walks, consider signing your Eskie up for dog sports—such as agility, flyball, or musical canine freestyle (a sport that incorporates obedience, tricks, and dance). Mental stimulation is important, too. Teach your pup new tricks or offer puzzle toys to satisfy their curious natures.\n\nThese dogs tend to slow down as they get older, and middle-aged Eskies will require less exercise than younger pups.","care-training":"It's no surprise that American Eskimo Dogs excelled as circus performers. Among the most trainable breeds, Eskies quickly master basic commands and can learn much more complicated tricks (like walking a tightrope).\n\nThe breed is so smart that it will often pick up behaviors just from watching other dogs—and that's not always a good thing. Get a jump start on training to ensure this eager-to-please breed is channeling its focus positively. Untrained or under-socialized Eskies can develop behavior problems and might be destructive.\n\nAmerican Eskimo Dogs crave the companionship of their people. So, focus on training activities that promote interaction. Also, use positive reinforcement—such as praise and treats—to reward them for a job well done.

Though small Black and Tan terriers existed in Germany as far back as the 18th century, this particular breed has only been around since the 1920s.\n\nAs the story goes, a group of Fox Terrier fans decided to abandon their investment in the English breed because they thought it was losing its hunting abilities. To develop a replacement, they began crossing suitable rough-coated English Fox Terriers, Welsh Terriers, and Old English \"broken-haired\" Terriers.\n\nThough much documentation of this crossbreeding was lost during World War II, one thing is for sure: the German Hunting Terrier is a terrier breed through and through. In fact, as many as 10 additional terrier breeds likely contributed to the final breed at one time.\n\nIn the early days—thanks to the large number of contributing breeds—the German Hunting Terrier came in a wide variety of sizes and colorings. But eventually, breeders began selecting for a specific coat color alongside the preferred drive, tenacity, and health traits.\n\nThe United Kennel Club recognized the breed on January 1, 1993.","facts":"German Hunting Terriers are exceptional working dogs with fantastic drive and agility. They are fearless hunting companions and retrievers, capable of pursuing quarry both above and below ground. As a result, the German Hunting Terrier is one of the most popular terrier breeds used for hunting today.","traits-appearance":"The German Hunting Terrier is a compact, well-proportioned hunting dog with a fiery expression.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"A German Hunting Terrier's coat can be either wiry, smooth, or broken. Regardless of texture, it should be thick enough to protect the dog from briars, dampness, and cold weather. This breed is typically black and tan—with the tan being more rust-colored on the muzzle and undercarriage.","traits-physical":"These dogs have long, wedge-shaped heads, V-shaped ears set high on the head, and small, dark eyes. Their deep, narrow chests allow them to enter the dens of prey with ease while hunting.","temperament":"German Hunting Terriers are intelligent, energetic, and watchful dogs. Though usually friendly with people, they are—as their name suggests—dedicated hunters. As such, they aren't well-suited to be just housepets, and they may become restless without the opportunity to do what they do best: hunt and flush.\n\nTypical of the terrier family, these pups are persistent workers with an independent nature. They are courageous, relentless hunters with an unending supply of energy.","care-nutrition":"German Hunting Terriers need a diet formulated for their specific life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). Because of their size, these dogs require more calories per pound of body weight than larger dogs. Experts recommend a dog food formulated for small breeds. These diets have the appropriate blend of nutrients and a smaller kibble size that is easier for German Hunting Terriers to chew and digest.\n\nAll dogs can become overweight if they consume too many calories. It's important to monitor the amount of food your dog eats and keep treats to no more than 10% of their caloric intake. For a small dog like the German Hunting Terrier, even a couple of extra snacks can lead to weight gain.","care-grooming":"Weekly brushing and the occasional bath are all that's needed to keep a German Hunting Terrier's coat clean. You should also regularly trim their fast-growing nails and clean their ears if you notice any wax or debris build-up. Lastly, they require a consistent dental hygiene program that includes at-home teeth brushing and professional dental cleanings.","care-exercise":"German Hunting Terriers thrive when they receive plenty of exercise. Hunting is, of course, their preferred way to burn off energy. They also seem to enjoy playtime in a fenced backyard, long walks, and chasing balls. Dog sports—such as agility, competitive obedience, and rally—are other great ways to provide both physical and mental exercise.","care-training":"This breed is usually eager to please and very easy to train. However, German Hunting Terriers have a typical terrier temperament, which means they can be headstrong and stubborn. So, a firm and consistent training approach works best.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.ukcdogs.com/jagdterrier\n\nhttps://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/jagdterrier/\n\nhttps://www.eukanuba.co.uk/breeds/german-hunting-terrier-(deutscher-jagdterrier)\n","reviewed-by":"Laura Inman, DVM","date-reviewed":"2020-09-05T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":7.7,"weight-range-pet-max":10.0,"weight-range-show-min":7.7,"weight-range-show-max":10.0,"height-range-min":33.0,"height-range-max":41.0,"life-span-range-min":14.0,"life-span-range-max":16.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":null,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":null,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":null},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4f184c6f-1a4c-5817-ac07-33b840bcf4b3/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4f184c6f-1a4c-5817-ac07-33b840bcf4b3/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4f184c6f-1a4c-5817-ac07-33b840bcf4b3/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4f184c6f-1a4c-5817-ac07-33b840bcf4b3/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4f184c6f-1a4c-5817-ac07-33b840bcf4b3/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4f184c6f-1a4c-5817-ac07-33b840bcf4b3/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4f184c6f-1a4c-5817-ac07-33b840bcf4b3/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4f184c6f-1a4c-5817-ac07-33b840bcf4b3/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4f184c6f-1a4c-5817-ac07-33b840bcf4b3/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4f184c6f-1a4c-5817-ac07-33b840bcf4b3/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4f184c6f-1a4c-5817-ac07-33b840bcf4b3/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4f184c6f-1a4c-5817-ac07-33b840bcf4b3/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4f184c6f-1a4c-5817-ac07-33b840bcf4b3/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4f184c6f-1a4c-5817-ac07-33b840bcf4b3/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4f184c6f-1a4c-5817-ac07-33b840bcf4b3/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4f184c6f-1a4c-5817-ac07-33b840bcf4b3/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4f184c6f-1a4c-5817-ac07-33b840bcf4b3/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4f184c6f-1a4c-5817-ac07-33b840bcf4b3/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"4f42878f-f843-5593-958d-323fda539d7c","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/4f42878f-f843-5593-958d-323fda539d7c"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"miniature-american-shepherd","name":"Miniature American Shepherd","plural-name":"Miniature American Shepherds","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"Once known as the Miniature Australian Shepherd, these smart dogs developed through the selective breeding of small Australian Shepherds to further reduce their size.\n\nThese dogs, now known as Miniature American Shepherds, worked on the rodeo circuit herding sheep and goats.

How ancient? Well, 2500-year-old paintings from the tomb of a Qin Dynasty prince feature dogs that look like the Shanxi. The breed gets its name from the Chinese god Zhang Xian, who often takes the form of a dog.\n\nSome experts believe the Shanxi Xigou is the original sighthound breed. Emperors used these speedy dogs to locate and track prey—a job they performed brilliantly for centuries. But when the Chinese government banned hunting by citizens, the Shanxi lost its usefulness. Today, the breed remains rare. That said, the China Kennel Union is attempting to restore its population.","facts":"The Shanxi Xigou is a rare sighthound breed that originated in China. These majestic dogs are skilled hunters, dependable guard dogs, and devoted companions.","traits-appearance":"Shanxi Xigou are large, majestic dogs built for speed and endurance. They have a slender, muscular build and an elegant, balanced appearance.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Shanxi have short, smooth, silky coats with feathering on the legs and back of the thighs and longer hair on the ears and tail.

Their long tails sit low and have a curve or ring at the end.","temperament":"These noble, independent, often aloof dogs are devoted to their humans but are often wary of strangers. In addition to being skilled hunters, they make excellent guard dogs.","care-nutrition":"Shanxi Xigou thrive on a high-quality diet formulated for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). To maintain their slender physique, keep an eye on their food intake and measure out portions to avoid overfeeding. And don't forget to account for treats. As a guideline, they should make up no more than 10% of a dog's daily calories.","care-grooming":"Brushing to remove loose fur and the occasional bath are all that's needed to keep a Shanxi's coat looking its best. To prevent ear infections, check their ears regularly and clean them as needed to remove wax build-up and debris. Nail trims should also be part of every dog's grooming routine. If your pup's nails grow too long, they can cause pain and potentially lead to problems running or walking.\n\nLastly, good [dental hygiene](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) will support your dog's overall health.

The breed name in Gaelic is \"Madra Rua,\" which translates to \"red dog.\"\n\nBreeders created Irish Setters by mixing the Old Spanish Pointer, setting spaniels, and early Scottish setters. Though they're well-known for their solid red coats, early versions of the breed were white with red blotches, similar to the [Irish Red and White Setter](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/irish-red-and-white-setter). In the early 1800s, the Earl of Enniskillen developed the rich, red coat that the breed is renowned for today.\n\nIrish hunters bred these dogs to work swiftly on any terrain and in any climate. They're excellent at scent-hunting, pointing, and retrieving, and are especially well-suited for hunting on the wetlands.\n\nThe Irish Setter arrived in the United States in the early 19th century with Irish immigrants. And the American Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1878. During the 1970s, the Irish Setter was one of the most popular breeds in America. Though Irish Setters aren't as commonplace in the States as they once were, sportsmen and pet owners alike still adore the breed.","facts":"Irish Setters are intelligent, gentle, and happy dogs. They make rugged hunting partners and affectionate family members—fitting perfectly into any active, outdoorsy lifestyle. Just be prepared to draw some attention because the Irish Setter's stunning red coat will turn heads wherever it goes.","traits-appearance":"The Irish Setter has a sturdy yet elegant build. Racy and athletic, these dogs look every bit the swift-moving hunters that they are.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Irish Setter has short, fine hair on the head and forelegs. The coat on all other parts of the body is moderate-length and flat. Long, silky feathering and fringe adorn the ears, legs, chest, belly, and tail.\n\nThe coat comes in a range of shades, from deep mahogany to rich chestnut. A small amount of white on the chest is possible. The breed's coat may also have lighter shading around the feathering.","traits-physical":"The Irish Setter has a long, lean head that's emphasized by chiseling along the muzzle. Dark or medium brown, almond-shaped eyes give this breed a soft, alert expression. The ears hang close to the head and are so long that they nearly reach the nose. The tail is moderately long and tapers to a fine point.","temperament":"Irish Setters are a friendly, playful breed. They love to be around people and are great with kids. However, this breed is not for everyone. Due to their active, energetic nature, Irish Setters require a lot of exercise. For this reason, they aren't a great fit for inactive families or apartment living.\n\nFirm but gentle training from an early age is important for Irish Setters. Because of their strong hunting instincts, Irish Setters will happily ignore their owners and follow a scent trail without adequate training to stay on task. Irish Setters are also slower to mature than other breeds, which means their boisterous, mischievous \"puppy phase\" will last well into their adult years.\n\nThis good-natured breed loves to be the center of attention. Though they're eager to please and adore their people, Irish Setters can also be independent or stubborn.","care-nutrition":"To meet their nutritional needs, feed your Irish Setter a high-quality food that's appropriate for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior) and energy level.\n\nIrish Setters are at a greater risk than other breeds to bloat (also known as twisted stomach). To help prevent bloat, break your dog's food up into several meals a day, and use a food bowl specially designed to slow their rate of eating. When timing meals, avoid feeding your pup immediately after any kind of vigorous activity and wait at least an hour after eating before allowing them to run or exercise.\n\nThese are just a few ways you can help prevent this life-threatening condition. A veterinarian is the best resource for other recommendations—including surgical options—for preventing bloat.\n\nAll dogs have the potential to become overweight, and it's easy to feed your pup too many calories without realizing it. Keep your Irish Setter at a healthy weight by monitoring their food intake and measuring out meals to avoid accidental overfeeding. Also, don't forget to count calories from treats in their daily totals. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of a dog's calories.","care-grooming":"An Irish Setter's coat requires brushing at least twice a week with a soft-bristled brush or pin brush to keep it looking its best. Use a long-toothed comb as necessary to work out any tangles.\n\nBecause of their long ears, Irish Setters may be more susceptible to ear infections. So, check and clean your ears regularly to prevent infections. Also, maintaining good [dental hygiene](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) is essential for the overall long-term health of all dogs. In addition to professional dental cleanings, establish an at-home dental care routine that includes regular teeth brushing.","care-exercise":"Irish Setters need more exercise than most dogs. So, be sure to provide yours with plenty of physical and mental challenges. Dog sports—such as field trials, hunting, agility, tracking, and competitive obedience—are fun ways to exercise their bodies and minds. Other ideas include long walks, jogging, hiking, or games of fetch in an enclosed yard.","care-training":"The Irish Setter has the reputation of being a bit of an airhead and thus difficult to train. But the more likely cause of this perceived flightiness is owners using training techniques that don't motivate the breed. Irish Setters do best with short training sessions combined with plenty of exercise and playtime.\n\nAs mentioned before, Irish Setters can also be stubborn. But you can overcome these tendencies by using treats and favorite toys as rewards during training sessions.","care-health":null,"references":"http://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/IrishSetter.pdf\n\nhttps://www.akc.org/expert-advice/lifestyle/things-about-the-irish-setter/","reviewed-by":"Cindy

Historically, Cane Corsos have been used as guard dogs and catch dogs—subduing boars or other wild animals until their owners arrived.\n\nExperts believe the breed's name comes from the Latin \"cohors,\" which could refer to a farmyard, enclosure, corral, or bodyguard. The American Kennel Club fully recognized the breed in 2010 as a member of the working group.","facts":"Say \"ciao\" to one of the most valued dogs in Italy. The Cane Corso is an intelligent, easy-to-please canine. This even-tempered breed tends to be very loyal to its family and gentle with children. Highly trainable, Cane Corsos also make excellent guard dogs.","traits-appearance":"The handsome Cane Corso has a strong yet compact body with long and powerful muscles.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Cane Corso's short, coarse coat comes in black, gray, fawn, and red colors, as well as brindle variants.

Though not necessarily dog-aggressive, Cane Corsos may respond defensively if provoked. Assertive and willful, these dogs may challenge the authority of lenient owners.","care-nutrition":"Cane Corsos should be fed a high-quality dog food that is age-appropriate. And it's important to monitor your pup's food intake and reduce meal portions if necessary. Also, remember that too many treats, in addition to regular meals, can contribute to obesity.","care-grooming":"The short, double-layered coat of the Cane Corso sheds throughout the year, especially in spring. Weekly brushing with a medium-bristle brush, hound glove, or rubber grooming mitt or tool will help remove dead hair and promote new hair growth.\n\nThe Cane Corso's nails must be trimmed regularly, as overly long nails can cause pain and problems with walking and running.","care-exercise":"Despite their large size, Cane Corsos are known for their speed and agility, and they need lots of exercise. A fast-paced walk or a lengthy run twice daily is often enough to ensure they maintain a healthy body and mind.\n\nBut many Cane Corsos also enjoy dog sports, such as obedience, dock diving, tracking, and more. These jobs provide much-needed mental stimulation, as well. (Which is useful because a bored dog equals a destructive one.)","care-training":"The Cane Corso requires proper socialization and [obedience training](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-obedience-training) when young—especially since they have protective instincts.\n\nBecause these dogs can be a little stubborn, they're better suited for experienced owners.

Hound","plural-name":"Plott Hounds","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The Plott Hound is one of the few Coonhound breeds to originate in the United States without any English Foxhound ancestry.\n\nIn 1750, Johannes “George” Plott arrived in America with five Hanoverian Hounds. For seven generations, he and his descendants bred those dogs in the mountains of North Carolina. These dogs eventually carried the family Plott name and became famous as Coonhounds.\n\nIn 1989, the Plott Hound became the state dog of North Carolina.","facts":"American-bred, the Plott Hound is an active, alert, and intelligent dog. These loving dogs enjoy swimming and other activities, and although they do tend to have a stubborn streak, early and proper training can help them become the perfect pup.","traits-appearance":"This hunting hound is muscular and streamlined, with a long tail and flashy coat that comes in an array of brindle-stripe patterns. They also come in solid colors as well, such as black and a rare buckskin. They have droopy, medium-length ears and a confident face.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The smooth, fine, and glossy Plott Hound coat is actually thick enough to offer protection against the elements when hunting. They are any shade of brindle, including yellow, buckskin, tan, brown, chocolate, liver, orange, red, light or dark gray, blue or Maltese, and black. They may also be solid black, or any shade of brindle with black saddle, and black with brindle trim. There is also a rare buckskin color ranging from red fawn or light cream to dark fawn or golden tan.","traits-physical":"The Plott Hound has a fine and glossy coat that’s striking in appearance, and it comes in multiple shades of brindle.","temperament":"The Plott Hound is eager to please, but they also have a stubborn and independent streak that can make training difficult. They are loyal and alert when they’re with people, and bold and aggressive when hunting in the fields.","care-nutrition":"Feed your Plott Hound a high-quality dog food that’s suited to their particular age, activity level, and size, as well as any additional health concerns.\n\nAs with any dog, it’s important to monitor the amount of food and treats that you give your Plott Hound to avoid having them become overweight, especially as they age. Your veterinarian is always a good source to help provide you with appropriate nutrition and feeding guidelines.","care-grooming":"The Plott Hound’s striking fur requires minimal grooming to maintain its health and shine. Weekly brushing with a soft-bristle brush or grooming mitt will do the trick. A Plott’s floppy ears also require additional addition. Be sure to regularly inspect and clean their ears with a dog-specific ear cleaning solution.\n\nAll dogs require regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care), including at-home teeth brushing and professional dental cleanings, and the Plott Hound is no exception. Maintaining good dental hygiene is important for their overall long-term health.","care-exercise":"These tough hunters are an active and energetic breed and require plenty of vigorous daily exercise.\n\nSince the Plott Hound aims to please and loves to hang with people, activities where you engage with your Plott—like play sessions in the yard—will be a favorite pastime for you both. Long walks or jogs are excellent exercise options, as well.\n\nAs with most hounds, the Plott has a strong instinct to hunt.

The effort produced dogs with some very unique characteristics and good overall health. This new breed became known as the Elo (short for Eloschaboro—a combination of letters lifted from the crossed breeds' names).\n\nAs breeding continued, a lack of sufficient Eurasiers soon became a problem. So, breeders included Chow Chows, Samoyeds, and Dalmatians to expand the Elo genetic base.\n\nAt this time, kennel club organizations and the FCI do not recognize the Elo breed.","facts":"The Elo is a new breed of dog that is quickly winning the hearts of pet parents. These smart, playful, and energetic pups make excellent companions and fun family pets.","traits-appearance":"Because Elos were bred for behavioral attributes rather than physical traits, their appearance can vary from dog to dog. But in general, they are medium-sized with a slightly fox-like appearance.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Elos typically have medium-length, beautiful coats and dense undercoats that protect them in harsh climates. They are usually white with chocolate, black, grey, or red.","traits-physical":"These dogs have long muzzles and are longer than they are tall. The Elo's thick tail forms a large plume that curves over the back.","temperament":"The Elo is an intelligent, playful, and energetic dog. Because these pups are usually friendly and good with children, they make excellent family pets (which was, after all, the original goal for the breed).\n\nThanks to their working dog ancestors, Elos tend to be active animals. Though they have a low prey drive and are unlikely to chase, they do need regular exercise and tend to get bored if left alone too long. And pent up energy can result in undesirable behaviors, such as digging.\n\nThese loyal dogs want nothing more than to be with their people and are happiest when included in family activities.","care-nutrition":"Elos require a diet formulated for their specific life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). To help them stay at a healthy weight, carefully monitor their food intake, and keep treats to no more than 10% of their daily calories.","care-grooming":"Because of their thick double coats and tendency to shed, Elos need weekly brushing to remove loose hair and keep their coats clean. They also require regular nail trims, ear cleanings, and a dental care routine that includes both at-home teeth brushing and professional dental cleanings.","care-exercise":"As active dogs, Elos thrive when they get lots of daily exercise. And these playful pups enjoy plenty of activities—long walks, runs, and games of fetch are all fun for an Elo. This breed also excels at canine sports, such as field trials, tracking, agility, and obedience.","care-training":"Elos are attentive people-pleasers, which makes them relatively easy to train. As with all dogs, early socialization is essential for their healthy development. So, be sure to introduce your Elo to various people, pets, and situations to help them grow into a well-adjusted adult dog.","care-health":null,"references":"https://breedadvisor.co.uk/elo/\n\nhttps://www.dogzone.com/breeds/elo/\n\nhttps://www.mydogbreeds.com/elo\n","reviewed-by":"Laura Inman, DVM","date-reviewed":"2020-09-05T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":22.0,"weight-range-pet-max":34.9,"weight-range-show-min":22.0,"weight-range-show-max":34.9,"height-range-min":46.0,"height-range-max":163.0,"life-span-range-min":13.0,"life-span-range-max":16.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":null,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":null,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":null},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/51a0fc9a-6a01-5a0b-bdd6-8dc6e2da5db2/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/51a0fc9a-6a01-5a0b-bdd6-8dc6e2da5db2/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/51a0fc9a-6a01-5a0b-bdd6-8dc6e2da5db2/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/51a0fc9a-6a01-5a0b-bdd6-8dc6e2da5db2/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/51a0fc9a-6a01-5a0b-bdd6-8dc6e2da5db2/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/51a0fc9a-6a01-5a0b-bdd6-8dc6e2da5db2/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/51a0fc9a-6a01-5a0b-bdd6-8dc6e2da5db2/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/51a0fc9a-6a01-5a0b-bdd6-8dc6e2da5db2/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/51a0fc9a-6a01-5a0b-bdd6-8dc6e2da5db2/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/51a0fc9a-6a01-5a0b-bdd6-8dc6e2da5db2/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/51a0fc9a-6a01-5a0b-bdd6-8dc6e2da5db2/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/51a0fc9a-6a01-5a0b-bdd6-8dc6e2da5db2/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/51a0fc9a-6a01-5a0b-bdd6-8dc6e2da5db2/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/51a0fc9a-6a01-5a0b-bdd6-8dc6e2da5db2/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/51a0fc9a-6a01-5a0b-bdd6-8dc6e2da5db2/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/51a0fc9a-6a01-5a0b-bdd6-8dc6e2da5db2/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/51a0fc9a-6a01-5a0b-bdd6-8dc6e2da5db2/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/51a0fc9a-6a01-5a0b-bdd6-8dc6e2da5db2/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"51ea95c5-1e5d-5832-9321-f9eb2c24fc14","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/51ea95c5-1e5d-5832-9321-f9eb2c24fc14"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"gotlandsstovare","name":"Gotlandsstövare","plural-name":"Gotlandsstövaren","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"Experts believe the Gotlandsstövare is a descendant of Eastern European hounds brought to Sweden by troops returning home in the 17th and 18th centuries. But after that, this Swedish scenthound has a complicated history.\n\nThe Swedish Kennel Club accepted the breed standard for the Gotlandsstövare in 1920. But 10 years later, the club decided Gotlandsstövares should be combined with the yellow variety of Smålandsstövare. In 1934, the club pivoted again, declaring the Gotlandsstövare part of the Hamiltonstövare breed.\n\n(A yellow coat wasn't part of the Hamiltonstövare breed standard. But the occasional yellow puppy was born in a litter and registered. Since most of these yellow puppies originated on the island of Gotland, people referred to them as Gotlandsstövares.)\n\nIn 1990, the Gotlandsstövare received recognition as a distinct breed. But the breed's population has remained extremely small, and it's considered endangered today.","facts":"The Gotlandsstövare is a rare hunting breed with a keen nose and friendly, lively personality.","traits-appearance":"The Gotlandsstövare is a medium-sized dog with a rectangular body and elegant overall appearance.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Gotlandsstövares have smooth, close-lying, short coats. They come in yellow or reddish yellow and have symmetrical white markings on the nose, chest, legs, and paws.","traits-physical":"Notable traits of the breed include dark brown, almond-shaped eyes, triangular drop ears, and a flat, strong back.","temperament":"Friendly, lively dogs, Gotlandsstövares possess excellent hunting abilities. Their sweet, gentle nature also makes them outstanding family pets.","care-nutrition":"Gotlandsstövares thrive on a high-quality diet formulated for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). Foods designed specifically for medium-breed dogs are also a great option to consider.\n\nTo help your dog maintain a healthy weight, measure their portions to avoid overfeeding and keep an eye on how many treats you're giving them. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of a dog's daily calories.","care-grooming":"Weekly brushing and the occasional bath are usually sufficient to keep a Gotlandsstövare looking their best. To reduce your pup's chance of ear infections, check their ears regularly and clean them as needed to remove wax build-up and debris.\n\nNail trims should also be part of every dog's grooming routine. If nails grow too long, they can cause pain and potentially lead to problems running or walking.\n\nLastly, good [dental hygiene](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) will support your dog's overall health. Dental disease is one of the most common health conditions in adult dogs. Left untreated, it can contribute to other serious issues. In addition to professional cleanings, establish an at-home dental care program that includes regular teeth brushing and veterinarian-recommended dental chews.","care-exercise":"As active pups, Gotlandsstövares need daily exercise to be happy and healthy. Brisk walks, play sessions in the backyard, and long hikes are all great ways to keep them active.","care-training":"Gotlandsstövares respond well to reward-based training methods using treats and plenty of praise. In addition to basic obedience training, they benefit from [early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization). Introducing your pup to different people and environments when they're young will help them develop into a confident, well-mannered adult dog.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.skk.se/en/NKU-home/nordic-dog-breeds/sweden/gotlandsstovare/\n\nhttp://www.gotlandsstovare.se/in-english/\n\nhttps://sv.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotlandsstövare\n\nhttp://www.skk.se/Global/Dokument/Rasstandarder/standard-gotlandsstovare-skk5.pdf","reviewed-by":"Annette

Domestic Cat","plural-name":null,"published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"cat","history":"Domestic cats are arguably the most familiar of all the cat breeds—and certainly the most common. In fact, people actually refer to them as \"common cats,\" as well as housecats and alleycats. The result of random-bred cats, they are the \"mixed-breeds'' of the feline world.\n\nThe longhaired variety of the Domestic cat likely originated in Western Asia. They lived there for several centuries before being imported to Europe in the 16th century. In the 1700s, these cats departed on ships for the United States, where they worked—along with their shorthaired counterparts—as dedicated rodent catchers.\n\nEarly pioneers adored American Domestics for their work ethic and keen hunting skills. They provided these cats with shelter and food in exchange for keeping the barns and food storage areas free from vermin. It wasn't long before Domestics worked their way fully into their owners' lives. They graduated from the clean-up crew to beloved family members and have never looked back.\n\nThough Domestics aren't pedigreed cats, some cat associations allow them to compete in shows in a general \"housecat\" category.","facts":"American Domestic cats are a delightfully mixed bag of adorable features and personalities. No matter what you're looking for in a feline friend, there's undoubtedly a Domestic cat out there that will meet your criteria.","traits-appearance":"Unlike other breeds recognized by their specific physical characteristics, Domestic cats come in a wide range of colors, sizes, and builds. Still, they’re typically medium-sized and muscular.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The coat of a Domestic cat comes in all colors, patterns, and lengths. Any coat combination that's genetically possible is on the table for this breed.","traits-physical":"Perhaps American Domestic cats' most distinctive physical trait is their uniqueness. There are no hard and fast rules for these cats, which means the average Domestic may display any number of adorable features.","temperament":"As with their physical appearance, American Domestic cats' personalities vary. Some cats are chatty and like to be the life of the party, while others make for quiet, calm, lap cats. And some prefer to interact with their humans on an \"as needed\" basis—these are the most independent and aloof of the bunch.\n\nBecause of their background as barn cats and rodent catchers, American Domestics are typically athletic and agile, with strong hunting instincts. Using feather toys and other items they can pounce on or chase gives them a much-needed outlet for their natural tendencies.\n\nDomestics also tend to enjoy keeping an eye on the outside world. High perches where they can safely look out at birds and other wildlife will keep them entertained for hours.","care-nutrition":"Domestic cats require a high-quality diet. Because nutritional needs vary for kittens, adults, and senior cats, opt for a formula that's age-appropriate for your pet.\n\nObesity is a growing health concern for cats. To keep calories in check, portion out meals using a standard measuring cup, and reduce amounts if your cat gains weight. Also, keep an eye on how many treats you're giving them. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of a cat's daily calories.\n\nIn addition to their meals, make sure there's plenty of fresh, clean water available for your cat at all times.","care-grooming":"Though American Domestics are excellent self-groomers, they still need regular brushing to keep their coats looking their best. Shorthaired cats can usually get by with weekly brushing using a rubber or steel comb. Longhaired cats are more prone to tangles and mats and may require daily brushing.\n\nIn addition to combing, trim their claws monthly to prevent overgrowth. Nails that get too long are more likely to get snagged on something and become torn or damaged. Overgrown nails can also grow into their paw pads, leading to pain or infection.

Some experts believe the [Tibetan mastiff](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/tibetan-mastiff) and [Samoyed](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/samoyed) contributed to the breed.\n\nThe name \"chow\" may come from the Cantonese word for edible, and these dogs might have actually been a source of food in ancient China. However, the British expression \"chow chow\" (describing odds and ends transported on cargo ships) could have also been the inspiration for the breed's name.\n\nThroughout history, Chow Chows have been faithful companions to nobility in China and elsewhere. For example, Queen Victoria of England received the breed as a gift in 1865. The Chow Chow reached peak popularity in the 1980s, and their numbers have declined steadily over the last decade.","facts":"Bred to guard sacred temples and hunt, the Chow Chow retains its strong work ethic and guarding tendencies. Those who own these refined yet puffy \"lion dogs\" can attest to their loyalty.","traits-appearance":"The Chow Chow is a compact, stout breed with a large head and a short, deep muzzle. Small, pointed ears and deep-set eyes make it appear as though the breed is scowling. The long fur and a \"mane\" around the neck earned the Chow Chow the nickname \"lion dog.\"","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Chow Chows have two separate coat types: rough and smooth. Both are densely double-coated. But the rough coat's fur is straight and coarse with a thick, wooly undercoat. The smooth coat is, well, smooth and has an undercoat but no obvious \"ruff\" on the legs or tail.\n\nThe breed standard includes five colors: red, black, blue, cinnamon, and cream. In red Chow Chows, the shade ranges from light golden to deep mahogany. Cinnamon Chow Chows vary from light fawn to deep cinnamon.","traits-physical":"A blue-black tongue is a hallmark of the breed. The Chow Chow's lips, gums, and mouth are also blue-black in color—with the darker colors preferred for the breed standard. Chow Chows share this distinction with [the Chinese Shar-Pei](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/chinese-shar-pei).","temperament":"Famous for its devoted and protective nature, the Chow Chow tends to be independent and not very affectionate—even toward beloved owners. Though these dogs tolerate children, their stature, strength, and guarding tendencies call for close supervision.\n\nChow Chows are wary of strangers and unfamiliar dogs, which is why they make such excellent guard dogs.","care-nutrition":"All dogs thrive on a high-quality diet designed for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior), and Chow Chows are no exception. These pups also tend to be slightly overweight, and their heavy coats can hide the extra pounds. To avoid weight problems, measure out your dog's meals, minimize the number of treats, and steer clear of table scraps or high-fat items that could lead to weight gain.","care-grooming":"Chow Chows are fastidious—often compared to cats for their lack of odor and overall cleanliness. But brushing them at least twice per week removes dead hair and helps control shedding. You should spend extra time grooming the fur around their heads, which can develop into painful mats if not brushed out regularly. And after a bath, use an air dryer (on the \"cool\" setting) to thoroughly dry your dog's coat.\n\nAll grooming routines should also include trimming nails, cleaning ears, and [brushing teeth](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care).","care-exercise":"The Chow Chow might be a working breed. But its exercise needs are actually quite minimal. Daily walks and games of fetch in the yard are usually enough to tire out these dogs.\n\nAvoid exercising your Chow Chow during hot weather, as the breed struggles in high heat and humidity and isn't suited for vigorous exercise. In cold weather, these well-insulated dogs may be extra playful.\n\nAs long as Chow Chows receive short bouts of physical activity regularly, they adjust well to apartment living.","care-training":"The same independent nature and stubbornness that makes Chow Chows excellent guard dogs can make them challenging to train. You should be firm in your approach. But avoid being too forceful, which can degrade trust and cause the breed to rebel.\n\n[Early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) and consistent obedience training (that includes praise and treats) can turn an aloof, overprotective Chow Chow into a loyal family dog and safe household companion.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/chow-chow/\n\nhttps://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/dog-breeds/chow-chow\n\nhttp://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/ChowChow.pdf","reviewed-by":"Annette

Curl","plural-name":null,"published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"cat","history":"All American Curls can trace their ancestry back to a longhaired black kitten with funny-looking ears. Joe and Grace Ruga found this kitten on their doorstep in California in 1981. Noting her peculiar curly ears—and the fact that she clearly needed a meal—they took her in and named her Shulamith.\n\nShulamith gave birth to a litter six months later, and half of them had her same curly ears. These kittens—and their subsequent litters—captured the attention of cat fanciers and geneticists alike.\n\nThe Rugas and their fellow Curl breeders sought recognition of this new breed by the Cat Fancier Association (CFA). Meanwhile, renowned geneticist Roy Robinson began studying data on over 300 Curls to better understand the mutation that led to curled ears. Robinson determined that the ear-curling gene was dominant—meaning only one copy of the gene is needed for the trait to show.\n\nAmerican Curls are a relatively new cat breed. The CFA accepted them for registration in 1986 and granted them Championship status in 1993.","facts":"American Curls stand out for their adorable curled back ears. But their infectious personality, loving nature, and playful attitude are just as worthy of attention.","traits-appearance":"American Curls are medium-sized cats with an alert appearance and sweet expression. Their elegant bodies are well-balanced, slender, and moderately muscled. They have round heads, curled-back ears, and walnut-shaped eyes.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Curl's coat comes in longhair and shorthair varieties. Both types have a fine, silky texture and minimal undercoat, but longhair Curls have a plumed tail. Any combination of colors and coat patterns is possible.","traits-physical":"The Curl's unique ears are the breed's trademark feature. All American Curl kittens are born with straight ears that start to curl back after several days. The ears first form tight curls, then gradually unfurl until they reach their permanent position at around four months. The degree of the curl can vary. Some ears are nearly straight, while others form a smooth 90-180 degree arc.","temperament":"American Curls are people-oriented cats that want to be involved in every aspect of family life. Whether you're watching a movie, making dinner, or taking a shower, Curls will be by your side—just in case you need their help.\n\nThese friendly, social cats get along well with other cats, kids, and respectful dogs. They also readily adapt to different surroundings and situations. As long as there are plenty of people around to give them attention, they can be happy just about anywhere.\n\nCurls are known for maintaining their kitten-like playfulness well into adulthood. They also have a curious nature and like to explore every nook and cranny of their environment. Interactive toys, games of fetch, cat trees for climbing, and high places to perch will all keep this lively breed entertained.\n\nImportant to note: Curls are early risers. And if they get their way, you will be, too. Gentle taps and head bumps are their preferred ways to subtly (but persistently) let you know it's time to start the day.","care-nutrition":"Curls require a high-quality diet. Because nutritional needs vary for kittens, adults, and senior cats, opt for a formula that's age-appropriate for your pet.\n\nTo help your Curl maintain their slender physique, measure out meals and reduce portions if necessary. Also, keep an eye on how many treats you're giving them—especially if giving human food. Just one small piece of cheese can account for half their recommended daily calories. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of a cat's daily calories.\n\nFinally, all cats need access to fresh, clean water at all times.","care-grooming":"Shorthair Curls need weekly combing with a soft brush to remove loose fur. Longhair Curls have a lighter undercoat and don't shed as much, but they still require occasional brushing to look their best.\n\nCurls also need weekly ear cleanings to remove wax build-up and regular nail trims. Nails that get too long are more likely to snag on something and become torn or damaged. And overgrown nails can even grow into your cat's paw pads, leading to pain or infection. In addition to clipping, providing a scratching post will allow your cat to do some nail maintenance themselves (thanks to their instinct to scratch).\n\nLike all cats, American Curls should follow a dental care routine that includes at-home teeth brushing and professional dental exams and cleanings.","care-exercise":null,"care-training":null,"care-health":"Roughly one out of every three cats in the United States is overweight or obese.

There, the White Shepherd was a precursor to the popular German Shepherd dog, and in fact its body type made it one of the breeds selected to create the German Shepherd. For almost a century, there was little discerning between the German Shepherd and the White Shepherd. Then, in the 1930s, the white-colored dog was removed from shepherd breeding, and it almost became extinct.\n\nBy the 1960s the White Shepherd had made a comeback, and in the U.S. and Canada it was distinguished as a separate breed. In the early 1970s, some of these dogs were sent to Switzerland, where they prospered and multiplied. The new White Swiss Shepherd breed was added to the Swiss Stud Book in 1991, and in 2017 the Kennel Club of the United Kingdom officially recognized the breed as well.","facts":"This herding dog is an active and loyal family pet—and even does well with children—as long as they are properly trained and socialized from a young age. It’s important to know they have a high prey drive and protective instinct, and they also tend to get bored easily; they can become destructive when they aren’t properly stimulated with exercise.","traits-appearance":"These powerful, medium-sized dogs have many of the same hallmark characteristics of a German Shepherd. They are elegant and handsome, with a chiseled head, almond-shaped eyes, elongated, triangular ears, and a strong jaw. They are firm of body and built for activity.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The White Swiss Shepherd has two coat varieties, one medium and one long. Both of these are dense double coats that can be slightly wavy with a bushy tail. As the name implies, the breed is entirely white.","traits-physical":"Although most of the White Swiss Shepherd body is similar to that of other shepherd breeds, the pure white coat of the White Swiss sets it apart from the rest.","temperament":"The White Swiss Shepherd is generally versatile and alert, lively, and friendly. A dog of this breed that is properly socialized should get along well with other people and animals.\n\nThe White Swiss Shepherd does have a protective streak, but when properly trained and socialized from a young age, they are lively and friendly dogs that get along well with people and other dogs. They can get bored easily, though, so keeping them stimulated both mentally and physically is important.","care-nutrition":"White Swiss Shepherds require a high-quality dog food that is age-appropriate—whether it’s commercially manufactured or homemade (with a veterinarian’s supervision and approval). It’s important to monitor the amount of food you give your White Swiss Shepherd. Reduce the portions or restrict calories if your pup gains weight.\n\nYour veterinarian is always a good source to help provide you with appropriate nutrition and feeding guidelines.","care-grooming":"The White Swiss Shepherd comes in two coat lengths: medium or long. Either one sheds heavily and requires regular weekly brushing to remain healthy.\n\nAll dogs require regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care), including at-home teeth brushing and professional dental cleanings, and the White Swiss Shepherd is no exception. Maintaining good dental hygiene is important for their overall long-term health.","care-exercise":"White Swiss Shepherds can be low-key when indoors, but they require a good amount of exercise to stay healthy. Two or three daily walks can keep them happy and help them avoid boredom.

According to documentation, short-tailed cats have lived on the islands for over 200 years. Experts believe either military members or scientists brought the cats to central Russia in the mid-20th century.\n\nWhen Kurilian Bobtails first appeared in cat shows in 1990, experts speculated that the cats were versions of the Japanese Bobtail. And it's likely the Kurilian was the source of the original gene mutation that causes the Japanese Bobtail's short tail. (This has yet to be proven.) One key difference, however, is that the Japanese Bobtail was carefully bred into existence, whereas the Kurilian came about naturally.\n\nKurilian Bobtails have keen mousing skills—a talent that made them popular pets in Russia. But it's their laid-back attitude that earned the favor of many families throughout Europe.\n\nDespite their compelling qualities, Kurilian Bobtails have yet to make a name for themselves in North America. Fewer than 100 cats of this rare breed live in the United States today.","facts":"Kurilian Bobtails are highly intelligent, easily trained cats that adapt well to all environments. Their outgoing personalities and peaceful nature make them an excellent fit for just about any family.","traits-appearance":"Kurilian Bobtails are medium-to-large cats with pompom tails and a wild appearance. They have compact bodies and broad chests that give an overall impression of strength and power.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Long- and short-coated varieties of the Kurilian exist. Both have a moderate undercoat and silky texture, but longhairs also have a ruff, britches, toe tufts, and plumed tails. This breed comes in various colors and patterns—including bi-color, patched, tortie, solid, smoke, silver, and golden.","traits-physical":"When it comes to this breed, no two tails are alike. Each consists of a series of kinks or curves that create a whisk, spiral, or snag shape. Other notable features of the Kurilian include a large, modified wedge-shaped head, walnut-shaped eyes, and medium, triangular ears.","temperament":"Kurilian Bobtails have a \"go with the flow\" attitude that makes them well-suited for life with other pets and kids. They're trusting, outgoing cats with very balanced personalities. Under the bed sheets or on a lap are their favorite places to sleep.\n\nLife with a Kurilian is typically a low-key affair. These cats have a clownish nature and enjoy playing, but they're only a moderately active breed. Kurilian Bobtails are intelligent, quickly learning house rules and commands. And when they want to get a better view of the world, they use their impressive jumping skills to launch themselves onto high lookout points.","care-nutrition":"Kurilian Bobtails require a high-quality diet formulated for their current age group (e.g., kitten, adult, senior).\n\nTo keep your cat at a healthy weight, measure out meals and reduce portions if necessary. And don't forget to account for treats. As a guideline, they should make up no more than 10% of a cat's calories.\n\nFinally, all cats need access to fresh, clean water around the clock.","care-grooming":"The Kurilian Bobtail's coat isn't prone to mats or tangles. Both longhaired and shorthaired varieties have relatively low-maintenance grooming needs. Brushing once a week will remove loose fur and keep your cat looking their best.\n\nMost cats' nails require monthly trimming to prevent them from getting too long. Long nails are more likely to snag on something and become torn or damaged. They can even grow into your cat's paw pads, leading to pain or infection. In addition to clipping, providing a scratching post will allow your cat to do some nail maintenance themselves (thanks to their instinct to scratch).\n\nNo grooming routine is complete without a little dental hygiene. To support your Kurilian's overall health, brush their teeth daily and schedule visits with your veterinarian for professional dental cleanings and exams.","care-exercise":null,"care-training":null,"care-health":"Roughly one out of every three cats in the United States is overweight or obese. And those extra pounds can contribute to other health risks—such as arthritis, diabetes, and heart problems.

But fossil records of the species are scarce. So, it's challenging to piece together their exact origin. The Golden Jackal's place in mythology and folklore, however, is well-documented.\n\nAnubis, the ancient Egyptian god of embalming, was often shown as a jackal-headed man or a jackal wearing ribbons. The Golden Jackal also frequently appears in Indian folklore and literary works ranging from the Bible to *The Jungle Book*.\n\nToday, human attitudes toward Golden Jackals vary. Some people praise them for their ability to hunt vermin. Others persecute them for their tendency to prey on livestock. Disease, hunters, and habitat loss are the biggest threats to their population. That said, their numbers currently remain strong.","facts":"Golden Jackals are the most widely distributed type of jackal. They share a resemblance to the grey wolf, though they're smaller and lighter.","traits-appearance":"Golden Jackals look much like a smaller, lighter version of the grey wolf.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Golden Jackal's fur is coarse and relatively short. As you might expect, these pups have golden coats that range from pale yellow to dark tawny. Their backs have black, brown, and white hairs that sometimes give the appearance of a dark saddle, and their underparts range from light ginger to cream.","traits-physical":"Compared to the grey wolf, Golden Jackals have shorter legs and an elongated torso. They also have less prominent foreheads and narrower, more pointed muzzles. The end of the breed's tail reaches the heel or just below.","temperament":"Golden Jackals are highly adaptable. They're nocturnal when living in areas near humans but may be partly diurnal elsewhere. As monogamous animals, they live in mated pairs—foraging, hunting, and caring for their young together. Jackal families often have one or two \"helpers,\" or adult jackals that stay with their parents for a year to help care for a younger litter. They communicate using various howls and even howl in unison with their mate to indicate their bond.","care-nutrition":"Omnivores, Golden Jackals enjoy a diverse diet that changes with the seasons. They are opportunistic eaters that consume fruits, vegetables, insects, rodents, birds, reptiles, and even young gazelles.","care-grooming":"Golden Jackals have heavy shedding periods in the spring and fall (when they blow their coats). And they commonly groom one another as part of their social interactions.","care-exercise":"Most active during the cooler parts of the day, Golden Jackals are fast animals when hunting prey—capable of running for long periods.","care-training":"Since they're wild animals, Golden Jackals are usually not suitable pets. But some people have hand-raised them as young pups and successfully tamed them. In these instances, they behave similarly to dogs but remain shy and suspicious around strangers.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.thainationalparks.com/species/golden-jackal\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_jackal#Etymology_and_naming\n\nhttps://worldanimalfoundation.org/advocate/wild-animals/params/post/1279367/jackals","reviewed-by":"Laura

With high strength and endurance, Malamutes have historically pulled sleds full of supplies across long distances. But they also made excellent hunting companions—distracting bears during hunts and finding seals using breathing holes.\n\nDuring the gold rush, demand for sled dogs boomed. And people often mixed purebred Alaskan Malamutes with other dogs, nearly pushing the breed to extinction. Fortunately, these lovable pups survived.\n\nIn 1935, the original Kotzebue line of the Alaskan Malamute breed earned recognition from the American Kennel Club, which later added the M'Loot and Hinman lines to their breed registries. The current Alaskan Malamute gene pool includes dogs from all three lines.","facts":"Alaskan Malamutes may be best known as sled dogs. But they're also adoring, playful animals. With the right training and socialization, the Malamute makes a great, hardworking family pet.","traits-appearance":"These powerful, muscular dogs have deep chests, broad shoulders, large heads, triangular ears, and large, furry tails.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Malamutes have thick, coarse coats that come in several different colors—including black and white, blue-gray and white, gray and white, red and white, sable and white, silver and white, agouti and white, and pure white.","traits-physical":"You can easily recognize an Alaskan Malamute by its wolf-like appearance and signature face mask (except when the dog is entirely white).","temperament":"Outgoing, affectionate, and devoted companions, Alaskan Malamutes love people and are great with children. This breed enjoys curling up on the couch—but only after a lot of demanding exercise and stimulating activities.\n\nAs pack dogs, Malamutes typically do well with other dogs in the home. But they might not immediately get along with strange dogs. Alaskan Malamutes also have strong predatory instincts and may consider smaller animals as prey. So, take care to establish other pets as part of the family. [Early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) can also help with this.\n\nDespite their size and imposing stature, Alaskan Malamutes are often too friendly to be effective guard dogs.","care-nutrition":"Alaskan Malamutes require a high-quality dog food that is age-appropriate—whether it's commercially manufactured or homemade (with a veterinarian's supervision and approval). Look for foods designed for large, high-energy breeds. And keep in mind that dogs engaged in endurance activities like sledding or skijoring (when a dog pulls a person on skis) may require extra calories.\n\nThese highly active dogs aren't prone to weight issues. But it's important to monitor how much your Alaskan Malamute eats and reduce portions or restrict calories if your pup gains excess weight. Also, remember that giving too many treats in addition to regular meals can contribute to obesity.","care-grooming":"Daily grooming is required to keep your Malamute's thick, coarse coat looking its best. A metal comb and pin brush are the ideal tools for the job. Grooming is especially important for this breed because its waterproof fur often becomes matted, which can impact skin health.\n\nAlaskan Malamutes blow their coats twice per year. During these times, you'll need to groom more frequently to manage your dog's undercoat. Bathing them with conditioner will also keep their coat from becoming too dry.\n\nFinally, all dogs need their nails trimmed, ears cleaned, and [teeth brushed](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) regularly.","care-exercise":"Strong, active dogs, Alaskan Malamutes are members of the working dog group and require a lot of exercise. So, be prepared for long walks and off-leash play at fenced-in dog parks. Because without enough opportunities to burn off their energy and appease their working instincts, Alaskan Malamutes can become bored and destructive.\n\nEnrolling Alaskan Malamutes in activities like agility, obedience trials, and weight-pulling competitions are other fun options. These athletic dogs also make excellent running partners and perfect companions for backpacking trips, competitive sledding, and skijoring.","care-training":"The Alaskan Malamute is an intelligent breed that responds well to positive, reward-based training. But these dogs can also be stubborn and willful. So, consistent, rigorous training is essential for raising a respectful, obedient dog.\n\nBecause Malamutes are pack animals, they must understand their place in the family hierarchy. Without adequate socialization and training, they may become dominant with other pets and kids—posing a risk due to their sheer size and strength.\n\nUse toys and treats to capture this breed's attention. And remember that some behaviors, such as digging, are hardwired into Alaskan Malamutes and may be hard to eradicate—even with the best training.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/alaskan-malamute/\n\nhttps://www.amcb.info/en/alaskan-malamute/origin-and-history/\n\nhttp://alaskanmalamute.org/malamutes/breed-standard/","reviewed-by":"Cindy Elston, DVM, MPH","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":27.7,"weight-range-pet-max":47.6,"weight-range-show-min":30.8,"weight-range-show-max":41.7,"height-range-min":58.0,"height-range-max":71.0,"life-span-range-min":10.0,"life-span-range-max":14.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":92,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":55,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":37},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/560a9e41-2686-51f8-9807-636556f6a139/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/560a9e41-2686-51f8-9807-636556f6a139/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/560a9e41-2686-51f8-9807-636556f6a139/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/560a9e41-2686-51f8-9807-636556f6a139/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/560a9e41-2686-51f8-9807-636556f6a139/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/560a9e41-2686-51f8-9807-636556f6a139/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/560a9e41-2686-51f8-9807-636556f6a139/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/560a9e41-2686-51f8-9807-636556f6a139/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/560a9e41-2686-51f8-9807-636556f6a139/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/560a9e41-2686-51f8-9807-636556f6a139/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/560a9e41-2686-51f8-9807-636556f6a139/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/560a9e41-2686-51f8-9807-636556f6a139/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/560a9e41-2686-51f8-9807-636556f6a139/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/560a9e41-2686-51f8-9807-636556f6a139/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/560a9e41-2686-51f8-9807-636556f6a139/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/560a9e41-2686-51f8-9807-636556f6a139/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/560a9e41-2686-51f8-9807-636556f6a139/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/560a9e41-2686-51f8-9807-636556f6a139/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"561d8689-01a1-58ed-84aa-d2f61a0b66ef","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/561d8689-01a1-58ed-84aa-d2f61a0b66ef"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"parson-russell-terrier","name":"Parson Russell Terrier","plural-name":"Parson Russell Terriers","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The Parson Russell descends from early, white-bodied working terriers.\n\nReverend John Russell developed the breed to hunt fox during the 1800s. The small-bodied dogs helped drive foxes from their lairs, giving the hunters easy access.\n\nThe Kennel Club of the United Kingdom first recognized Parson Russell Terriers in 1990. And the breed received American Kennel Club recognition in 1997.","facts":"The Parson Russell Terrier is the show dog version of the Jack Russell and Russell Terrier. These feisty and energetic pups make high-spirited, affectionate companions.","traits-appearance":"Parson Russell Terriers have square bodies and narrow chests—along with a smart and scruffy look.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"White with brown, black, tan, cream, or tricolor markings, the Parson Russell Terrier's double coat may be a combination of smooth and rough (wiry). This mixture of textures gives the coat a broken appearance.","traits-physical":"Square and balanced, the Parson Russell Terrier has a slender build and an outgoing and animated step.","temperament":"Known worldwide for being an active and confident breed, the Parson Russell Terrier has a fearless and happy disposition. These dogs make loving companions and always want to be a part of the family fun.\n\nKeep in mind that, if restricted to a small area and left alone, the Parson Russell will take matters into its own paws. This may mean digging up the yard or crawling under the fence to explore—or anything in between.\n\nParson Russell Terriers may chase wildlife or other dogs. And they're often challenging to disengage from an activity that has their attention.","care-nutrition":"Parson Russell Terriers need to eat high-quality food that's appropriate for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). To keep them at a healthy weight, monitor food portions carefully. And be sure to take treats into account when tracking their daily calorie intake. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of a dog's calories.","care-grooming":"The Parson Russell Terrier can have one of two coat types: smooth or broken. Both require regular brushing.\n\nUse a thick brush or hound glove on the smooth part of the coat and a pin or slicker brush—to lift loose hair and debris—on the rough parts. The rough coat of a Parson Russell Terrier will need plucking or clipping to avoid matting of the longer hairs.\n\nMonthly bathing and nail trims are adequate for this breed. But you should check and clean the ears of your Parson Russell Terrier weekly to avoid wax buildup and the accumulation of debris.","care-exercise":"Parson Russell Terriers love to run—whether in an open field, woodsy trail, or neighborhood park. This high-energy breed enjoys fetching, agility, flyball, and frisbee. Parson Russell Terriers also have the keen sense of smell necessary to participate in earthdog trials.\n\nThis breed has a strong prey drive, so a leash (or fenced-in yard) is mandatory. The Parson Russell Terrier won't be satisfied sitting alone in a secluded spot for any length of time.","care-training":"Eager to learn, and well-suited for reward-based training, the Parson Russell Terrier needs consistent and strong guidance. This breed tends to get bored easily, so aim to keep training fun and interesting.\n\nAnd remember, [early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) helps puppies of all breeds develop into well-mannered adult dogs.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/parson-russell-terrier/","reviewed-by":"Laura Inman, DVM","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":5.0,"weight-range-pet-max":10.4,"weight-range-show-min":5.9,"weight-range-show-max":7.7,"height-range-min":28.0,"height-range-max":38.0,"life-span-range-min":13.0,"life-span-range-max":15.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":111,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":64,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":45},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/561d8689-01a1-58ed-84aa-d2f61a0b66ef/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/561d8689-01a1-58ed-84aa-d2f61a0b66ef/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/561d8689-01a1-58ed-84aa-d2f61a0b66ef/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/561d8689-01a1-58ed-84aa-d2f61a0b66ef/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/561d8689-01a1-58ed-84aa-d2f61a0b66ef/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/561d8689-01a1-58ed-84aa-d2f61a0b66ef/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/561d8689-01a1-58ed-84aa-d2f61a0b66ef/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/561d8689-01a1-58ed-84aa-d2f61a0b66ef/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/561d8689-01a1-58ed-84aa-d2f61a0b66ef/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/561d8689-01a1-58ed-84aa-d2f61a0b66ef/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/561d8689-01a1-58ed-84aa-d2f61a0b66ef/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/561d8689-01a1-58ed-84aa-d2f61a0b66ef/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/561d8689-01a1-58ed-84aa-d2f61a0b66ef/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/561d8689-01a1-58ed-84aa-d2f61a0b66ef/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/561d8689-01a1-58ed-84aa-d2f61a0b66ef/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/561d8689-01a1-58ed-84aa-d2f61a0b66ef/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/561d8689-01a1-58ed-84aa-d2f61a0b66ef/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/561d8689-01a1-58ed-84aa-d2f61a0b66ef/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"566a62aa-82af-5714-856b-e6245aa949b5","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/566a62aa-82af-5714-856b-e6245aa949b5"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"schnauzer-miniature","name":"Miniature Schnauzer","plural-name":"Miniature Schnauzers","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"Breeders created the Miniature Schnauzer by crossing the larger [Standard Schnauzer](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/schnauzer-standard) with smaller dogs. These included the [Affenpinscher](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/affenpinscher), [Miniature Pinscher](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/miniature-pinscher), and [Poodle](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/poodle-miniature).\n\nThe resulting breed worked on farms hunting rats and other vermin and guarding (very small) flocks. Most people didn't consider the Miniature Schnauzer to be an actual breed until 1899.\n\nMini Schnauzers arrived in the United States in 1925, and the American Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1926. Following World War II, the dog's popularity soared. At one time, Mini Schnauzers were the third most popular breed in America.","facts":"The Miniature Schnauzer is an intelligent, active, and eager-to-please breed.

The AKC standard recognizes three colors: black, black and silver, and salt and pepper. The hairs in the salt and pepper coat consist of black and white banded hairs, as well as solid black and white hairs in the topcoat.","traits-physical":"Mini Schnauzers have bushy eyebrows that frame their dark eyes, and long, thick beard and whiskers that grow around their noses and on their chins. In fact, this breed owes its name to its distinctively furnished muzzle.

They're friendly toward kids and other animals and like to play hard. Overall, they're a very good-natured dog.\n\nThe Miniature Schnauzer's world revolves around its home and family, which only enhances its skills as a good watchdog. These tenacious terriers may chase or bark at wildlife. And once something has captured their attention, it can be challenging to distract or disengage them.","care-nutrition":"Miniature Schnauzers require a high-quality, age-appropriate dog food. It can be commercially manufactured or homemade (under a veterinarian's supervision and approval).\n\nIt's essential to carefully monitor the amount of food you feed your Mini Schnauzer and reduce portions if your pup gains weight.

As long as your Mini Schnauzer doesn't get into something too dirty or smelly, monthly baths are often enough to keep them clean and tidy.\n\nMonthly nail trims and weekly ear checks (to tackle bothersome debris or wax buildup) are also necessary.","care-exercise":"Lively and fairly energetic dogs, Miniature Schnauzers require regular daily exercise—including games and tricks—to satisfy their mental and physical needs. They benefit greatly from enclosed areas where they can run and play with their people. These pups also enjoy canine sports such as agility, tracking, earthdog trials, rally, and competitive obedience.\n\nMiniature Schnauzers have a strong prey drive and are likely to chase after small animals.

Tzu","plural-name":"Shih Tzus","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The Shih Tzu—or \"lion dog\"—is an ancient breed with interesting (and somewhat unknown) roots.\n\nOne theory is that the development of the breed began in Tibet, China. As the story goes, the Dalai Lama gave the Emperor of China a [Lhasa Apso](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/lhasa-apso) in the 17th century. The dog mated with a [Pekingese](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/pekingese) in the palace, and the first litter of Shih Tzu puppies arrived shortly after.\n\nIn the palaces, emperors pampered the dogs, doting on them and meeting all of their needs in exchange for affection. The breeders were treated well, too, and received gifts for producing the most beautiful dogs. The breed was unknown outside of palace walls, and populations were so small that Shih Tzu almost became extinct in China after the Communist Revolution.\n\nThe first breed clubs were formed in Peking (now Beijing) in the 1930s. A decade later, U.S. military personnel brought several Shih Tzu back to the United States. The little dogs quickly became (and remain) one of the most popular toy breeds. A total of fourteen dogs—seven males and seven females—make up the entire breed's foundation stock.","facts":"The Shih Tzu is an outgoing and affectionate dog. They love people and cherish their roles as adorable lapdogs. Shih Tzu are especially fond of children and make great pint-sized playmates.","traits-appearance":"Shih Tzu are small, compact dogs with good weight and substance. True to their noble heritage, the breed has a proud bearing, arrogant carriage, trusting expression, and smooth, effortless gait.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Shih Tzu have a luxurious double coat with dense, long, flowing hair. The hair on their heads is tied up to keep it from their eyes. All colors are acceptable and commonly include black, black and white, blue, brindle, gold, liver, red, red and white, and silver.","traits-physical":"Shih Tzu have level toplines and large, round eyes set well apart that give them warm, sweet, wide-eyed expressions. They also have large, heavily coated ears, slight (adorable) underbites, and heavily plumed tails that are high set and carried in curves over their backs.","temperament":"These petite, quiet pups make excellent companions and house (or apartment) pets. Their personalities are usually outgoing, happy, affectionate, friendly, and trusting. Shih Tzu are true lap dogs and prefer having their owners around most of the time. If left alone for long periods, these dogs can become unhappy or anxious.\n\nThis extroverted breed likes being around people, performing tricks, and showing off their friendly dispositions. Although Shih Tzu are great with children and other pets, supervision is required to ensure these small dogs don't get hurt.","care-nutrition":"Shih Tzu require high-quality dog food that's appropriate for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). A diet designed specifically for small breed dogs is a good option to consider.\n\nShih Tzu are prone to obesity. Help them stay a healthy weight by portioning out their meals with a measuring cup to avoid overfeeding. And limit treats to no more than 10% of their daily calories (no matter how much they beg with those puppy-dog eyes).","care-grooming":"Shih Tzu with a shorter \"puppy cut\" require less grooming than dogs with unclipped coats. If their coats are left long, Shih Tzu require daily brushing. To keep painful mats from developing, brush their hair in layers to ensure the comb reaches their skin. Pinning up the hair on top of their heads can prevent eye irritation (and make a fashion statement). A bath at least once a month will help keep their coats clean and looking their best.\n\nIn addition to keeping their nails trimmed and ears cleaned, start a regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) routine. At-home teeth brushing and professional dental cleanings are part of an essential and lifelong dental hygiene program.","care-exercise":"Shih Tzu have moderate exercise needs. These social dogs love going for walks and exploring at the dog park—as long as they remain separate from larger dogs. They also enjoy playing hide-and-seek or fetch with their owners. And use games and tricks to provide much-needed mental stimulation. These little dogs can be big fans of activities like agility, competitive obedience, and canine musical freestyle.\n\nShih Tzu are not known for their stamina, so focus on short bursts of exercise and look for cues (like panting or falling behind on a walk) that signal it's time for a break. Despite having thick coats, these small dogs are vulnerable to the cold. They shouldn't spend long periods outside in cold temperatures.","care-training":"Shih Tzu are quick learners with stubborn streaks and may use their charm to get their way. A consistent, structured training program can help them learn basic commands and new tricks. These are sensitive dogs that respond best to positive reinforcement and reward-based training, not harsh training methods.\n\nLike other small breeds, Shih Tzu can struggle with housetraining and may be prone to barking. A gentle but firm approach to training can promote positive behaviors.\n\nStart introducing Shih Tzu to new people, pets, and places as puppies. Positive experiences are an essential part of [socialization](","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/shih-tzu/\n\nhttps://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/dog-breeds/shih-tzu\n\nhttp://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/ShihTzu.pdf","reviewed-by":"Cindy Elston, DVM, MPH","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":4.5,"weight-range-pet-max":9.5,"weight-range-show-min":4.5,"weight-range-show-max":8.2,"height-range-min":25.0,"height-range-max":28.0,"life-span-range-min":10.0,"life-span-range-max":15.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":71,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":44,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":36},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/575aa171-f920-5dad-8754-bf3180c89ab8/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/575aa171-f920-5dad-8754-bf3180c89ab8/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/575aa171-f920-5dad-8754-bf3180c89ab8/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/575aa171-f920-5dad-8754-bf3180c89ab8/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/575aa171-f920-5dad-8754-bf3180c89ab8/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/575aa171-f920-5dad-8754-bf3180c89ab8/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/575aa171-f920-5dad-8754-bf3180c89ab8/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/575aa171-f920-5dad-8754-bf3180c89ab8/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/575aa171-f920-5dad-8754-bf3180c89ab8/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/575aa171-f920-5dad-8754-bf3180c89ab8/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/575aa171-f920-5dad-8754-bf3180c89ab8/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/575aa171-f920-5dad-8754-bf3180c89ab8/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/575aa171-f920-5dad-8754-bf3180c89ab8/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/575aa171-f920-5dad-8754-bf3180c89ab8/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/575aa171-f920-5dad-8754-bf3180c89ab8/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/575aa171-f920-5dad-8754-bf3180c89ab8/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/575aa171-f920-5dad-8754-bf3180c89ab8/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/575aa171-f920-5dad-8754-bf3180c89ab8/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"57e272e1-850d-5116-804f-21027ee3b02f","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/57e272e1-850d-5116-804f-21027ee3b02f"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"field-spaniel","name":"Field Spaniel","plural-name":"Field Spaniels","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"Experts think the Field Spaniel may be a descendant of the Cocker Spaniel, [Sussex Spaniel](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/sussex-spaniel), and English Water Spaniel. Initially, all sporting spaniels fell into the Field Spaniel category. It wasn't until the late 1800s that the Field Spaniel earned recognition as a unique breed—separate from the Cocker Spaniel—due to its larger size.\n\nThe original Field Spaniel was a capable hunter. But continual cross-breeding with the Sussex Spaniel ultimately created a dog with greater length, heavier bones, and shorter legs. This body type didn't lend itself to hunting and nearly led to the breed's extinction. In response, breeders tried crossing the Field Spaniel with the [English Springer Spaniel](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/english-springer-spaniel), which restored the appearance and hunting capabilities of the original Field Spaniel.\n\nResearchers trace Field Spaniels' arrival in the United States to the late 1800s. The breed first received American Kennel Club recognition in 1894. Today, the Field Spaniel is one of the rarest breeds in the country.","facts":"The Field Spaniel is an intelligent, sensitive, affectionate, and loyal breed. Though often more docile than other spaniels, Field Spaniels are playful, energetic dogs with a keen sense of smell and excellent hunting abilities.","traits-appearance":"The Field Spaniel's build is a combination of beauty and utility. These dogs have a noble carriage and proud attitude. Their well-balanced, medium-size bodies are built for activity and endurance.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Field Spaniel has a reasonably long coat that's either flat or slightly wavy. It's dense and water-repellent, with moderate feathering on the chest, underbody, backs of legs, and buttocks.\n\nThe coat can be various shades of black or liver. Tan points and white markings—which may include ticking and roaning—often appear on the Field Spaniel's coat.","traits-physical":"The Field Spaniel's body is longer than it is tall, well-balanced, and solidly built. The breed's expressive eyes are almond-shaped, medium in size, and set moderately wide and deep. The color of the iris ranges from dark hazel to dark brown.\n\nPendulous, well-feathered ears hang close to the head. They are wide and long enough to reach the end of the muzzle. The tail is set low, just below the back, with a natural downward inclination.","temperament":"The Field Spaniel's playful, affectionate, and loyal nature make it an excellent breed for families. Though often described as docile, Field Spaniels are energetic dogs that are always up for a good play session. They love spending time with people and need plenty of attention and human companionship to be happy.\n\nField Spaniels are usually friendly and trustworthy around children and tolerant of other dogs. This breed may seem reserved around strangers at first, but they typically warm up over time.\n\nTrue to their spaniel nature, Field Spaniels have a keen sense of smell and excellent tracking, hunting, and retrieving abilities. They make fantastic pets for active families that enjoy being outdoors.","care-nutrition":"Field Spaniels require a high-quality food that's appropriate for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). To meet this active breed's nutritional needs, consider a diet formulated specifically for medium-size dogs.\n\nFood-motivated dogs, Field Spaniels love mealtime and treats. To prevent them from becoming overweight, keep a close eye on their food portions. And be sure to take treats into account when tracking their daily calorie intake—especially if you're using them as rewards during training sessions. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of your dog's calories.","care-grooming":"Field Spaniels are above-average shedders. Weekly brushing will help keep shedding under control and help their coats stay clean and shiny. Occasional trimming around the head and feet may also be needed.\n\nThe Field Spaniel's long ears may make them more susceptible to ear infections. For this reason, check and clean your dog's ears regularly to prevent infections from developing. And all dogs need their nails clipped often to prevent splitting or cracking.\n\nIn addition to professional dental cleanings, establish a regular at-home dental care routine that includes teeth brushing and dental chews or treats. Maintaining good [dental hygiene](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) is essential for the overall long-term health of all dogs.","care-exercise":"Field Spaniels are active dogs that need daily exercise and mental stimulation. They love water and being outdoors, so swimming and hiking are great ways to burn off energy.\n\nThey also enjoy participating in dog sports that let them exercise both their bodies and their minds. Competitive obedience, tracking, agility, rally, and field events are all fun activities for your Field Spaniel.","care-training":"As intelligent, independent thinkers, Field Spaniels are highly trainable. They respond best to vocal commands delivered in a mild but consistent manner.\n\nAs mentioned, this breed is food-motivated, which can be helpful during training sessions. Offer treats as rewards for giving up inappropriate items they've retrieved (a typical behavior for members of the spaniel family).\n\nFinally, [early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) will help your Field Spaniel develop into a well-adjusted adult

Longhaired Dachshund","plural-name":"Miniature Longhaired Dachshunds","published-at":null,"species":"dog","history":"The Dachshund dates back to the 15th century. Many believe the breed originated in Germany, though some evidence suggests it was also present in Greece, Egypt, China, and Mexico. Originally bred to hunt badgers, Dachshunds also proved successful hunting larger animals.\n\nExperts think breeders initially crossed Longhaired Dachshunds with toy terriers to create a miniature longhaired variety of the Dachshund. Many generations of selective breeding then followed. The result was stricter breed standardization and the desired miniaturization.\n\nThe Dachshund came to the United States in 1885 and received American Kennel Club recognition that same year.","facts":"The Miniature Longhaired Dachshund is an alert, lively, and active breed. And with its sleek, shiny coat, it's beautiful as well. Miniature Longhaired Dachshunds are known as much for their big personalities as they are their long, low bodies.","traits-appearance":"The Miniature Longhaired Dachshund is best known for the long body and short legs that earned the breed the nicknames \"hot dog\" and \"wiener dog.\"","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Miniature Longhaired Dachshunds come in various colors, including solid or bicolor combinations of light and dark black, red, and tan shades. Brindle and dapple patterns are also possible. The breed's long hair is especially noticeable on its ears, chest, and tail. And some Mini Longhaired Doxies have blue eyes.","traits-physical":"It's easy to recognize Miniature Longhaired Dachshunds by their long-backed bodies, pointy noses, and short (but powerful) legs.","temperament":"Miniature Longhaired Dachshunds are friendly, affectionate dogs. They love spending time with their people and want to take part in family activities and outings. For the same reason, Mini Doxies don't enjoy being left alone for long periods.\n\nBecause of their background as hunting dogs, Mini Longhaired Dachshunds may bark, scratch at the ground, dig, or chase wildlife. They might also be suspicious or fearful of strangers. In some cases, this could be because they're trying to avoid being picked up, which can cause discomfort to their long-backed body.","care-nutrition":"Mini Longhaired Dachshunds need high-quality dog food appropriate for their age and small size. It's critical that this breed not become overweight. In addition to other health concerns, any extra weight strains their long backs, potentially leading to disc problems. To keep Mini Doxies at a healthy weight, monitor their food intake carefully, and avoid feeding them too many treats.","care-grooming":"Miniature Longhaired Dachshunds are a clean breed, with little or no smell. Their brushing requirements depend on their coat thickness: Thicker coats need more frequent brushing to keep hair free from tangles and control the moderate shedding.\n\nDachshund's nails need trimming every month to keep them at an appropriate length. Overgrown nails can cause pain or lead to issues walking.","care-exercise":"Not every activity is safe for Miniature Longhaired Dachshunds due to their build. For example, long runs, hurdling fences, and vigorous swims are not appropriate for this breed. That said, these active pups are always eager to spend time with their people and burn some energy.\n\nDachshunds need regular exercise to maintain a healthy weight and build the muscles needed to protect their backs. To prevent injuries, avoid activities that involve jumping or climbing stairs.","care-training":"Miniature Longhaired Dachshunds have independent natures, so they may not always follow instructions. With their hunting instincts, keen senses of smell, and strong prey drive, they may choose instead to pick up a scent and follow it. Patience and consistency—as well as a kind tone and reward-based approach—are the best tools for training these sensitive dogs.\n\nDachshunds are very protective of their family and territory. [Socializing them as puppies](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) will ensure they develop into well-mannered adult dogs.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/dachshund/","reviewed-by":"Annette Louviere,

Fauve de Bretagnes from 1500s France. Before the French Revolution, only aristocrats owned the original line of Bretagnes. But by the late 1700s, the aristocracy had broken up, and the breed grew popular with more people.\n\nAs the dog transitioned from trotting alongside horses with aristocrats to providing companionship to hunters and aid to peasants, the Basset breed slowly developed a smaller stature with shorter legs.\n\nThroughout the 19th century, these Bassets gained glory for their ability to hunt a wide range of game—including rabbits, fox, deer, and boar. Today, the breed continues to gain popularity, particularly in France, where Basset Fauve de Bretagnes are still considered excellent hunting dogs.","facts":"There’s a lot to love about the Basset Fauve de Bretagne—a smart and joyful breed.

Though they enjoy keeping their people company, the Basset Fauve de Bretagne really shines at hunting—using their courageousness and intelligence to outsmart and outrun any prey.\n\nMany of this breed’s excellent hunting traits, such as their endurance, hard-working ethic, and intelligence, make them good pets, as well. With the appropriate amount of exercise, the Basset Fauve de Bretagne can be an agile, lively, and affectionate addition to any household. And [early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) and training can help them be friendly toward strangers and other animals.","care-nutrition":"As an active and energetic breed, Basset Fauve de Bretagnes need a high-quality dog food that’s suited to their particular age (as well as any additional health concerns).\n\nTo prevent weight problems, it’s important to monitor the amount of food and treats that you give your Basset Fauve de Bretagne.

River Retriever","plural-name":"Murray River Retrievers","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The Murray River Retriever is the only gun dog developed in Australia. References to the breed date back to the mid-1800s, but its exact origins are unknown.\n\nOne popular theory is that Irishmen brought their [Irish Water Spaniels](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/irish-water-spaniel) to Australia when they emigrated in the wake of the potato famine. They then developed these dogs further to protect paddle steamers and retrieve downed ducks along the banks of the Murray River.\n\nThough that's just one of several hypotheses, there's no question that the Murray River Retriever is closely associated with the river it's named after. Modern-day Murrays often work as search and rescue dogs, assistance dogs, and bomb detection dogs.\n\nCurrently, no official breed standard for the Murray exists. But the Murray River Retriever Association is in the process of petitioning the Australian National Kennel Council to recognize the breed.","facts":"A confident and energetic breed, the Murray River Retriever is skilled at flushing, retrieving, and tracking. But these loyal pups also make loving pets and are protective of their families.","traits-appearance":"Large dogs with a stocky build, Murray River Retrievers are longer than they are tall, with muscular legs and distinctive webbed feet.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Murray's liver-colored coat feels oily to the touch and is thick enough to protect against cold water. The curls on the coat range from tight curls to dense ringlets. These pups may also have feathering on the back of their forelegs.","traits-physical":"Murrays have broad, flat skulls, chiseled muzzles, hazel eyes, and large drop ears covered in wavy hair.","temperament":"Murray River Retrievers are intelligent, determined hunters and good-natured family pets. Affectionate with their humans, they have an instinctively loyal and protective nature.\n\nThis breed is typically friendly with other dogs. But they may benefit from slow, intentional introductions to cats or other small pets.","care-nutrition":"Murrays thrive on a high-quality diet formulated for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). To help your dog maintain a healthy weight, measure their portions to avoid overfeeding and keep an eye on how many treats you're giving them. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of a dog's daily calories.","care-grooming":"Grooming a Murray River Retriever is relatively low maintenance. Regular brushing and the occasional trim on their ears, back of their legs, and feet will keep your pup looking their best.\n\nThe Murray's long ears may make the breed more prone to ear infections. To help prevent issues, check your dog's ears regularly and clean them as needed to remove wax build-up and debris. Nail trims should also be part of every dog's grooming routine. If nails grow too long, they can cause pain and potentially lead to problems running or walking.\n\nLastly, good [dental hygiene](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) is critical to your pup's overall health. Dental disease is one of the most common health conditions in adult dogs. Left untreated, it can contribute to other serious issues. In addition to professional cleanings, establish an at-home dental care program that includes regular teeth brushing and veterinarian-recommended dental chews.","care-exercise":"This sporty breed needs a moderate amount of daily exercise to stay happy and healthy. Backyard play sessions, long walks, and games of fetch are all great ways to keep them active. These dogs also enjoy splashing around in the water and showing off their natural swimming abilities.","care-training":"Murrays are intelligent, eager-to-please dogs. They respond well to strong leadership and positive, reward-based training.\n\nAdditionally, all dogs benefit from [early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization). Getting your pup comfortable with different people and environments at an early age will help them develop into a confident, well-mannered adult dog.","care-health":null,"references":"https://janedogs.com/murray-river-retrievers/\n\nhttps://www.mrr.org.au/choosingamurray","reviewed-by":"Annette Louviere, DVM","date-reviewed":"2021-07-09T19:21:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":15.0,"weight-range-pet-max":30.0,"weight-range-show-min":15.0,"weight-range-show-max":30.0,"height-range-min":45.0,"height-range-max":61.0,"life-span-range-min":12.0,"life-span-range-max":16.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":null,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":null,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":null},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5a75b6b9-a423-53c6-86d4-a1c76f6fdf63/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5a75b6b9-a423-53c6-86d4-a1c76f6fdf63/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5a75b6b9-a423-53c6-86d4-a1c76f6fdf63/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5a75b6b9-a423-53c6-86d4-a1c76f6fdf63/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5a75b6b9-a423-53c6-86d4-a1c76f6fdf63/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5a75b6b9-a423-53c6-86d4-a1c76f6fdf63/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5a75b6b9-a423-53c6-86d4-a1c76f6fdf63/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5a75b6b9-a423-53c6-86d4-a1c76f6fdf63/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5a75b6b9-a423-53c6-86d4-a1c76f6fdf63/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5a75b6b9-a423-53c6-86d4-a1c76f6fdf63/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5a75b6b9-a423-53c6-86d4-a1c76f6fdf63/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5a75b6b9-a423-53c6-86d4-a1c76f6fdf63/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5a75b6b9-a423-53c6-86d4-a1c76f6fdf63/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5a75b6b9-a423-53c6-86d4-a1c76f6fdf63/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5a75b6b9-a423-53c6-86d4-a1c76f6fdf63/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5a75b6b9-a423-53c6-86d4-a1c76f6fdf63/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5a75b6b9-a423-53c6-86d4-a1c76f6fdf63/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5a75b6b9-a423-53c6-86d4-a1c76f6fdf63/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"5aadd304-d0e0-5684-8da7-657fc43e2cd1","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5aadd304-d0e0-5684-8da7-657fc43e2cd1"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"pixiebob","name":"Pixiebob","plural-name":null,"published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"cat","history":"Carol Ann Brewer founded the Pixiebob breed in the late 1980s in the Pacific Northwest. Her inspiration came from two cats she acquired: a polydactyl spotted male with a short tail and a tall, classic-patterned male that also had a short tail. When the latter mated with a neighborhood domestic cat and produced a litter, Carol kept one of the resulting kittens—a spotted, wild-looking female named Pixie.\n\nWanting to create more cats like Pixie, Carol began a breeding program. Over the years, she successfully developed cats with a native bobcat's appearance and a domestic cat's personality. Carol named the breed Pixiebob (after her beloved pet) and documented a breed standard.\n\nIn 1993, Carol sought recognition from TICA for the Pixiebob. TICA accepted the breed for Exhibition status in 1994 and granted them Championship status in 1998.","facts":"The Pixiebob may look like a wild bobcat. But these cats are easy-going, social, and devoted to their human families.","traits-appearance":"Visually similar to the North American Bobcat, Pixiebobs have large, rectangular bodies, long, heavy limbs, and short tails. Some have lynx tips on their ears—giving them an even more convincing bobcat appearance.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Pixiebobs may have long or short coats. The longhair's soft fur grows up to two inches long. Both versions have thick double coats with a wooly texture and a brown-spotted tabby coloring, which ranges from tawny to reddish-brown.","traits-physical":"The Pixiebob's tail is always at least two inches long (but may extend to the hock), carried low, and often kinked or knotted. Other key features include an inverted pear-shaped head, broad muzzle, and heavily hooded, deep-set eyes. The Pixiebob is also the only breed whose standard allows for extra toes (known as polydactyly).","temperament":"Pixiebobs form strong bonds with their humans (including kids) and get along with other pets. They are fearless, devoted cats that want to be included in all family activities. But they have a laid-back nature and aren't overly demanding. When they have something they want someone to know, they communicate using a series of chirps and chitters.\n\nThis active, intelligent breed can easily learn to fetch and loves to play with other animals and toys. Pixiebobs can even adapt to walking on a leash—allowing them to participate in family outings.","care-nutrition":"Pixiebobs require a high-quality diet. Because nutritional needs vary for kittens, adults, and senior cats, opt for a formula that's age-appropriate for your pet.\n\nAll cats are at risk of obesity if they overeat. One easy way to avoid overfeeding is to measure out meals and reduce portions if necessary. And be sure to account for treats. As a guideline, they should make up no more than 10% of a cat's calories.\n\nLastly, all cats need access to fresh, clean water around the clock.","care-grooming":"Pixiebob coats are relatively low maintenance, regardless of length. Weekly brushing is typically enough to remove dirt and loose fur and keep your cat looking their best. During periods of seasonal shedding, more frequent brushing may be necessary.\n\nYour cat's grooming routine should also include regular ear cleanings—to remove wax build-up and debris—and monthly nail trims. Long nails are more likely to snag on something and become torn or damaged. They can even grow into your cat's paw pads, leading to pain or infection. In addition to clipping, providing a scratching post will allow your cat to do some nail maintenance themselves (thanks to their instinct to scratch).\n\nAnd don't forget those teeth. Good dental hygiene—including daily at-home teeth brushing and professional cleanings and exams—is essential to a Pixiebob's overall health.","care-exercise":null,"care-training":null,"care-health":"Roughly one out of every three cats in the United States is overweight or obese. And those extra pounds can contribute to other health risks—such as arthritis, diabetes, and heart problems.

In 1948, the Swedish Kennel Club declared the Nordic Spitz extinct. It closed its studbooks, but the breed survived in remote villages where the dogs continue to work as watchdogs and companion animals.\n\nThanks to dedicated breeders, the Nordic Spitz returned to the Swedish Kennel Club—complete with a new breed standard—less than two decades later. The population remains small, with fewer than 3,000 Nordic Spitz living in Scandinavia and small numbers in the rest of the world.","facts":"Nordic Spitz are alert, confident, and daring dogs. These qualities make them excellent watchdogs—and their affectionate, loyal, and devoted natures make them great family pets as well.","traits-appearance":"Nordic Spitz are small spitz-type hounds with compact, well-muscled bodies, calm, keen expressions, and bold, daring demeanors.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Like other breeds from the region, the Nordic Spitz has a double coat consisting of a fine, dense undercoat and a topcoat with hard, short, and straight hair. The hair is shortest on the bridge of its nose, top of the skull, ears, and fronts of its legs. Longer hair covers its neck, backs of its thighs, and underside of its tail.\n\nNordic Spitz are pure white with a \"mask\" covering the sides of their heads and ears and well-defined, often large patches of color, ideally in shades of red or yellow.","traits-physical":"Nordic Spitz are compact and slightly rectangular in appearance. Though not bulky, the breed has well-developed muscles and slight angulation in their features, giving them rugged but graceful proportions. The breed has a short muzzle, high set and erect ears, and medium-sized, almond-shaped, brown eyes. Their tails are high set and carried in a high curve.","temperament":"Nordic Spitz are keen, attentive, and self-confident dogs when working and calm and affectionate companions at home.\n\nThe breed is known for its fearless attitude. It used its keen senses to hunt forest game and alert hunters to its location with high-pitched vocalizations. That strong hunting drive remains, so the Nordic Spitz is likely to chase small pets. However, it's not considered an aggressive breed and may get along well with other pets if introduced properly.\n\nNordic Spitz tend to bark when excited, so they don't do well in apartments.","care-nutrition":"Nordic Spitz require high-quality dog food that's appropriate for their activity level and life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior).\n\nAll dogs run the risk of obesity if they eat too many calories. Portion out their food in a measuring cup and limit treats to no more than 10% of their daily calories to keep them from becoming overweight.","care-grooming":"Nordic Spitz have minimal grooming needs. Most of the year, all they need is an occasional bath and brushing. During the spring and fall, they \"blow\" their coats and require daily brushing to help remove their dead undercoats.\n\nIn addition to regular ear cleaning and nail trims, start a [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) routine. Brushing your dog's teeth in between professional dental cleanings is part of a good dental hygiene program.","care-exercise":"Nordic Spitz are built to race through the woods during a hunt. These days, they might spend more time chasing tennis balls than small animals, but they're still an active breed that requires a lot of exercise.\n\nRegular walks or fast-paced, outdoor games (in a fenced yard) can help burn off their energy. This agile, active breed also has the stamina to tag along for outdoor activities like hiking and swimming. Rally, agility, flyball, and competitive obedience are other great activities for them to try.\n\nThese so-called \"weatherproof\" dogs were raised in harsh climates and have double coats that protect them from the elements. That means these pups are up for activities in all kinds of weather.","care-training":"Training is essential for these agile and attentive dogs. Regular sessions will establish positive habits and provide much-needed physical and mental stimulation. Games and puzzles will also appeal to this intelligent breed.\n\nThe Nordic Spitz likes activities that are fast-paced and interesting. Skip repetitive training sessions and keep it fun and upbeat.\n\nThis breed may be quick to learn, but don't expect training to get their barking under control. These dogs like to \"talk,\" and that innate behavior will be hard to train away. Even in the show ring where rules are strict, judged don't penalize Nordic Spitz for their frequent barking.\n\nUse positive, reward-based training, offering treats, toys, and praise instead of harsh criticism. Regular [socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) can also help the Nordic Spitz feel confident with unfamiliar people, pets, and situations.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/norrbottenspets/\n\nhttps://norrbottenspets.weebly.com/history.html\n\nhttps://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/Norrbottenspets.pdf","reviewed-by":"Annette Louviere, DVM","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":8.2,"weight-range-pet-max":15.0,"weight-range-show-min":8.2,"weight-range-show-max":15.0,"height-range-min":43.0,"height-range-max":46.0,"life-span-range-min":12.0,"life-span-range-max":15.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":90,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":56,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":42},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5b24c4e8-ae36-5831-8d24-aac536448ac0/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5b24c4e8-ae36-5831-8d24-aac536448ac0/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5b24c4e8-ae36-5831-8d24-aac536448ac0/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5b24c4e8-ae36-5831-8d24-aac536448ac0/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5b24c4e8-ae36-5831-8d24-aac536448ac0/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5b24c4e8-ae36-5831-8d24-aac536448ac0/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5b24c4e8-ae36-5831-8d24-aac536448ac0/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5b24c4e8-ae36-5831-8d24-aac536448ac0/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5b24c4e8-ae36-5831-8d24-aac536448ac0/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5b24c4e8-ae36-5831-8d24-aac536448ac0/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5b24c4e8-ae36-5831-8d24-aac536448ac0/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5b24c4e8-ae36-5831-8d24-aac536448ac0/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5b24c4e8-ae36-5831-8d24-aac536448ac0/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5b24c4e8-ae36-5831-8d24-aac536448ac0/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5b24c4e8-ae36-5831-8d24-aac536448ac0/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5b24c4e8-ae36-5831-8d24-aac536448ac0/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5b24c4e8-ae36-5831-8d24-aac536448ac0/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5b24c4e8-ae36-5831-8d24-aac536448ac0/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"5b6210a8-f2a6-5749-9316-1c244b0185f1","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5b6210a8-f2a6-5749-9316-1c244b0185f1"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"mcnab","name":"McNab","plural-name":"McNabs","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"Scotsman Alexander McNab loved Scotch Collies for their strong work ethic and endless stamina, and missed the breed after he moved to California. In 1866, McNab returned to his native land where he purchased two Scotch Collies and brought them back to America to work his ranch.\n\nMcNab bred the Scotch Collies with local dogs of Basque and English origins, developing a breed with the same strength, stamina, and herding abilities but smooth coats that were better suited to the California climate. He called the new breed the McNab. (It is also known as the McNab Border Collie, McNab Herding Dog, McNab Sheepdog, and McNab Shepherd).\n\nFrom these affectionate beginnings, the McNab developed a following among ranchers. It is now a well-known breed in the sheep-herding world, and excels in dog events such as agility.","facts":"McNabs are energetic, intelligent working dogs that require tasks to keep their minds and bodies engaged. The breed is known to form tight bonds with its owners and might choose one person as the singular focus of its affection.","traits-appearance":"The McNab is an off-square, almost rectangular dog with an athletic build. A little more long than tall, the breed is of medium bone and adequate substance without being heavy, weedy, or low-slung.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The McNab has a short, protective undercoat and a short, smooth, weather-resistant topcoat of medium length that either lies close to its body or slightly away—but is never plush or completely off-standing. It has a coarse, dense, and glossy texture. The hair is slightly longer on the tail and around the neck, forming a light ruff; dogs may also show furnishing on the tail, back of the hind limbs, and the ears.\n\nThe McNab's coat can be solid, bi-color or tri-color, and the white markings may be clear or have some ticking.","traits-physical":"These are sturdy dogs with broad, muscular backs; long, well-sprung ribs; strong, sturdy, and muscular hindquarters that allow them to move with balance, agility, and endurance. The McNab also has oval-to-round, compact feet; a medium-sized, powerful muzzle that tapers toward the nose; and medium-sized, triangular ears set somewhat apart on their skulls. Its oval-to- almond-shaped eyes are hazel, amber, or dark brown in color, lending these dogs keen, watchful, and intelligent expressions.","temperament":"Like other working dog breeds, McNabs are eager, intelligent, and energetic. These dogs can work long hours without a break and excel in their roles as shepherds and flock guardians. Work is essential to their happiness and, without it, McNabs can develop behavioral issues. McNabs do best in homes where their owners are active and committed to providing the mental and physical stimulation the breed needs to thrive.\n\nMcNabs are affectionate and loyal but might not make the best family dogs. Their strong herding tendencies could lead them to chase cars, corral children, or herd other pets. Additionally, McNabs tend to bond closely to a single person instead of spreading their affections around to the entire family. The breed is also known for being aloof, but not aggressive, around strangers.","care-nutrition":"Feed McNabs a high-quality dog food that is appropriate for their life stage (puppy, adult, senior) and consider a diet formulated for active breeds. With adequate exercise, this energetic breed might not become overweight, but portioning out their food with a measuring cup and limiting treats to no more than 10% of their daily calories can help keep McNabs fit and trim.","care-grooming":"Brush McNabs at least once per week to remove dead hair and keep their coats free of tangles, mats, and debris. During spring and fall when these dogs blow their coats, brush them with an undercoat rake several times per week. Keep their ears clean and their nails trimmed.\n\nLike all breeds, McNabs benefit from a regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) routine that includes at-home teeth brushing and professional cleanings.","care-exercise":"McNabs are high-energy dogs that require considerable amounts of exercise; a walk around the block is not going to cut it for this active breed. While these working dogs prefer to be tackling a task, regular outdoor activities such as running, hiking, swimming, and trips to the dog park can help McNabs burn off their energy. These highly intelligent pups also excel in dog sports such as agility, obedience, rally, and herding. Without adequate exercise, McNabs will get bored and could become destructive or neurotic.","care-training":"Training is a must for McNabs. These dogs are intelligent and eager to learn, which allows them to quickly master basic commands and learn new tricks. Training can also help channel their boundless energy in positive directions. Getting the entire family involved with training could facilitate stronger bonds with these fickle dogs. Focus on positive reinforcement and rewards-based training and avoid repetitive activities, which will cause McNabs to lose interest in training.\n\nMcNabs tend to be wary of strangers; socialization can help. Provide opportunities for these dogs to interact with new people, pets, and places, which provides important mental stimulation and encourages them to grow comfortable with unfamiliar people and situations.","care-health":null,"references":"https://ckcusa.com/breeds/mcnab/","reviewed-by":"Annette Louviere, DVM","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":15.9,"weight-range-pet-max":32.2,"weight-range-show-min":15.9,"weight-range-show-max":32.2,"height-range-min":38.0,"height-range-max":64.0,"life-span-range-min":13.0,"life-span-range-max":15.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":85,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":54,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":39},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5b6210a8-f2a6-5749-9316-1c244b0185f1/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5b6210a8-f2a6-5749-9316-1c244b0185f1/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5b6210a8-f2a6-5749-9316-1c244b0185f1/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5b6210a8-f2a6-5749-9316-1c244b0185f1/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5b6210a8-f2a6-5749-9316-1c244b0185f1/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5b6210a8-f2a6-5749-9316-1c244b0185f1/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5b6210a8-f2a6-5749-9316-1c244b0185f1/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5b6210a8-f2a6-5749-9316-1c244b0185f1/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5b6210a8-f2a6-5749-9316-1c244b0185f1/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5b6210a8-f2a6-5749-9316-1c244b0185f1/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5b6210a8-f2a6-5749-9316-1c244b0185f1/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5b6210a8-f2a6-5749-9316-1c244b0185f1/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5b6210a8-f2a6-5749-9316-1c244b0185f1/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5b6210a8-f2a6-5749-9316-1c244b0185f1/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5b6210a8-f2a6-5749-9316-1c244b0185f1/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5b6210a8-f2a6-5749-9316-1c244b0185f1/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5b6210a8-f2a6-5749-9316-1c244b0185f1/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5b6210a8-f2a6-5749-9316-1c244b0185f1/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"5ba799a8-0672-5122-b97c-b2032be73960","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5ba799a8-0672-5122-b97c-b2032be73960"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"soft-coated-wheaten-terrier","name":"Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier","plural-name":"Soft Coated Wheaten Terriers","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"Dating back to sometime between the late 18th century and early 19th century, the Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier is one of the oldest terrier breeds native to Ireland.\n\nCreated as an all-purpose farm dog and companion, the Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier proved talented at a variety of farm-related tasks—including herding, watching and guarding livestock, and hunting vermin.\n\nThe Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier earned recognition from the Irish Kennel Club in 1937 and came to the United States in 1946.

The Sámi people, an indigenous semi-nomadic tribe (also called Lapps or Laplanders), relied on Lapponian Herders to herd reindeer—earning them the nickname Reindeer Dogs.\n\nLapponian Herders are one of three Lapphund breeds. Some of the earliest references to these dogs, also known as the Lapinporokoira, date back to 1674. The population of Lapponian Herders plummeted when the Germans, forced out of Finland during World War II, burned down Lapland during their retreat. Dedicated breeders restored the breed in the late 1950s.\n\nOnce recognized as the same breed as the Finnish Lapphund, Lapponian Herders separated into their own breed—and gained acceptance into the Finnish Kennel Club—in 1966. In their native Finland, these dogs are still used to herd and guard reindeer, but their populations remain low.","facts":"The Lapponian Herder is an intelligent and affectionate working dog.

They have lighter grey or brown markings on their heads, lower bodies, and legs. White markings on their necks, chests, and legs are permitted. Their undercoats are black, grey, or brown.","traits-physical":"Lapponian Herders are muscular dogs that are slightly longer than tall with deep, long (but not broad) chests and tucked underlines. These dogs have straight, tapered muzzles and dark-colored, oval-shaped eyes that give them keen expressions.\n\nheir medium-length, pricked ears are set rather far apart, and profuse hair covers the inside of their ears. Lapponian Herders have medium-length, low set tails profusely covered with hair. Their tails are held in a loose curve and may follow a circular motion when they are wagging.","temperament":"Words like docile, calm, intelligent, and energetic best describe Lapponian Herders. This breed is friendly, outgoing, willing to serve, and eager to spend time with family. Lapponian Herders are excellent companions but can be standoffish (though not aggressive) with strangers.\n\nLapponian Herders are hardworking, active dogs that require a lot of mental and physical stimulation. This breed is happiest when given a job to do. They are good with children and pets but, due to their strong herding instincts, they may attempt to herd them.\n\nThese dogs are known for being vocal and are especially prone to barking while working—a trait that may not endear them to the neighbors.","care-nutrition":"Feed Lapponian Herders a high-quality dog food that's appropriate for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). Due to their high activity levels, Lapponian Herders tend to stay trim. However, it's still important to monitor their food intake. Using a standard measuring cup to portion out their food helps avoid overfeeding. Make sure treats account for no more than 10% of their daily calories.","care-grooming":"Lapponian Herders require regular brushing to remove dead hair and prevent matting. Like other double-coated breeds, weekly brushing is sufficient to maintain their coats. However, daily brushing is needed during \"shedding season\" in the spring and fall.\n\nClip their nails regularly to prevent them from becoming overgrown and causing pain or issues walking. Start a regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) routine that includes at-home teeth brushing when Lapponian Herders are puppies. This essential grooming task is important for good dental hygiene and lifelong health.","care-exercise":"Lapponian Herders need a job to do. This active breed likes to be on the go. They excel at sports such as competitive obedience, search and rescue, conformation, agility, rally, and dock diving. Any activities that take advantage of their strong work ethics, stamina, and eagerness to serve are good fits for this breed.\n\nLapponian Herders also make excellent companions for hiking, trail running, herding, and other outdoor activities. And they will happily engage in vigorous play sessions in their backyard or at the dog park. Without adequate exercise, these dogs are prone to becoming bored and destructive.\n\nMental stimulation is important, too. Offering puzzle toys or playing games like hide-and-seek will help tire out Lapponian Herders mentally and physically.","care-training":"Lapponian Herders are intelligent, obedient, and eager to learn new things. Focus on a positive, reward-based approach that uses praise, treats, and favorite toys to acknowledge good behavior. Start training when Lapponian Herders are puppies to channel their desire to please into positive behaviors. This early start helps ensure the dogs are well-trained into adulthood.\n\nLapponian Herders love being active, so use high-intensity training games to take advantage of their energy. Regular [socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) can also help the breed become more comfortable around strangers.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/lapponian-herder/\n\nhttp://www.fci.be/Nomenclature/Standards/284g05-en.pdf\n\nhttps://lapinkoira.weebly.com/lapponian-herder.html","reviewed-by":"Cindy

north central Thailand. Experts believe a local white and black dog owned by a Buddhist abbot, Mak Methavee, mated with a wild dog to create the first of the breed. The monastery kept 20-30 of these dogs, which were so effective at preventing intruders that locals began asking for puppies to protect their homes, boats, and livestock. \n\nIn 1957, selective breeding led to the development of the breed standard in place today. The breed has experienced a fad in Thailand since 2014, when a Bangkaew successfully prevented the robbery of the home of a famous Thai actor. The breed was accepted on a definitive basis by FCI in 2022.","facts":"The Thai Bangkaew is an intelligent, athletic, spitz-type dog.

To help them maintain a healthy weight, measure their meals to avoid overfeeding and keep treats to 10% or less of their daily calories.","care-grooming":"The Thai Bangkaew's coat requires frequent brushing to remove loose fur and dirt. A curry comb works great on their undercoats and will help prevent mats or tangles. In addition to brushing, regular ear checks, nail trims, and [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) should be part of their grooming routine.","care-exercise":"These dogs have a lot of energy and require daily exercise to keep them happy and healthy.

Though there are no written historical records of the breed, experts agree that the Estrela is one of the oldest breeds from the area.\n\nThe Estrela took its time to develop into the dog we know today. Over hundreds of years, herders celebrated the breed for its ability to survive in the mountain environment while still providing ample companionship and the ability to be an excellent guard dog, wary of strangers and intruders.\n\nThe Estrela dwindled in numbers until the beginning of the 20th century when special shows promoted these hard-working regional herding dogs.\n\nThe first records of the breed appeared in 1922, but it wasn’t until 1993 that the first official breed standard came about. The first breed standard included some of the traits particular to the Estrela Mountain Dog, like their double dewclaws and hooked tail.\n\nThese dogs are true mountain dogs, standing guard over their people as intelligent and loyal family companions.","facts":"The sturdy and strong Estrela Mountain Dog is wary of strangers, and as such, they make an excellent guard dog.

A black muzzle or mask is also desirable.","temperament":"This alert and intelligent mountain dog makes an excellent companion, and because they can be wary of strangers, they also make great watchdogs. They are loyal to their people, and although they can be independent and strong-willed at times, they can be trained and socialized with a little bit of patience.","care-nutrition":"Your Estrela Mountain Dog is a large breed that will do well with any age-appropriate, high-quality dog food suited to their particular weight and any additional health concerns.\n\nAs with any dog, it’s important to monitor the amount of food and treats that you give your Estrela Mountain Dog, especially since some dogs are prone to gaining weight as they age. Your veterinarian is always a good source to help provide you with appropriate nutrition and feeding guidelines.","care-grooming":"The Estrela Mountain Dog has a thick outer coat that requires weekly grooming and an occasional bath to stay healthy and shiny. They have double dewclaws, which require a little more attention than regular claws since they aren’t likely to wear down naturally. Be sure to check them periodically for clipping to ensure they don’t get caught or ingrown.\n\nAll dogs require regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care), including at-home teeth brushing and professional dental cleanings, and the Estrela Mountain Dog is no exception.

Nobles and royals originally bred these handsome dogs for falconry work—a job Portuguese Pointers continue to do in Portugal today.\n\nIn the 16th century, Portuguese Pointers grew popular among partridge hunters. In fact, the dogs became known as the perdigueiro—a name derived from the Portuguese word \"perdiz,\" meaning \"partridge.\"\n\nLater, in the 18th century, English families living in the wine region of Portugal brought Portuguese Pointers along when returning to England for vacation. These dogs helped found the English Pointer breed.\n\nSocial hardships and lack of ownership nearly wiped out the Portuguese Pointer in the 19th century. But in the 1920s, breeders successfully preserved the breed with the help of dogs in north Portugal.\n\nThe Portuguese Pointer has been a member of the American Kennel Club Foundation Stock Service since 2005.","facts":"Bred to work closely with their handlers, Portuguese Pointers are hardy, alert, and eager to please. With their limitless affection and calm, social nature, these smart dogs make fans out of hunters and housemates alike.","traits-appearance":"The Portuguese Pointer is a medium-sized, balanced dog with a square face that sets it apart from other breeds.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Portuguese Pointer's coat is short and dense. On the back, the hair is somewhat coarse to the touch. But on the head and ears, it's soft and velvety. Like others in the Pointer family, this breed's coat comes in shades of light yellow, yellow, or red-yellow with white patches.","traits-physical":"Like their heads, Portuguese Pointers' bodies are almost square. Their ears are triangular and drop style. And their tails are straight and medium length, tapering to a point.","temperament":"The Portuguese Pointer is an energetic breed that loves to be among people and makes a great family pet. Curious by nature, these friendly dogs are fun to be around.\n\nPortuguese Pointers are extraordinarily affectionate and devoted to their family members. However, they can be a little arrogant around other dogs.","care-nutrition":"Portuguese Pointers need high-quality food that's appropriate for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior.) All dogs are at risk for obesity if they eat too many calories. Avoid accidental overfeeding by measuring out meals. And be sure to include calories from treats when calculating their daily intake. As a general guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of a dog's calories.","care-grooming":"Keeping a Portuguese Pointer's coat in good shape is relatively easy. All it takes is an occasional once-over with a rubber curry brush to remove loose hair. This breed's coarse hair is rather good at repelling dirt and rarely needs washing.\n\nYour Portuguese Pointer's nails will wear down during regular activity. But you should still inspect them routinely for splits or cracks and trim them as needed. Overgrown nails can be painful and could eventually lead to issues walking or running.\n\nFinally, maintaining good [dental hygiene](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) is essential for the overall long-term health of all dogs. In addition to scheduling professional dental cleanings, aim to establish an at-home routine that includes regular teeth brushing.","care-exercise":"Bred to work, Portuguese Pointers are energetic dogs that need regular exercise and mental stimulation to be happy. They enjoy participating in field trials, agility, tracking, and obedience events. These activities allow dogs to exercise their bodies and minds simultaneously (and provide opportunities for dogs and their people to bond).\n\nThese high-endurance dogs also like going on long walks, jogs, and hikes. In the backyard, games of fetch are yet another fun way for Portuguese Pointers to burn off energy and show off their innate retrieving skills.","care-training":"The intelligence and patient nature of the Portuguese Pointer make it an easy breed to train. These dogs respond well to gentle, reward-based training using favorite treats or toys. And remember, [early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) helps all breeds develop into well-mannered adult dogs.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/portuguese-pointer/\n\nhttps://www.ukcdogs.com/portuguese-pointer\n\nhttp://www.fci.be/Nomenclature/Standards/187g07-en.pdf","reviewed-by":"Annette Louviere, DVM","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":15.9,"weight-range-pet-max":27.2,"weight-range-show-min":15.9,"weight-range-show-max":27.2,"height-range-min":48.0,"height-range-max":61.0,"life-span-range-min":12.0,"life-span-range-max":14.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":97,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":57,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":41},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5cd1b75d-37a6-5e1f-8500-8a24b8e926a2/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5cd1b75d-37a6-5e1f-8500-8a24b8e926a2/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5cd1b75d-37a6-5e1f-8500-8a24b8e926a2/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5cd1b75d-37a6-5e1f-8500-8a24b8e926a2/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5cd1b75d-37a6-5e1f-8500-8a24b8e926a2/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5cd1b75d-37a6-5e1f-8500-8a24b8e926a2/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5cd1b75d-37a6-5e1f-8500-8a24b8e926a2/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5cd1b75d-37a6-5e1f-8500-8a24b8e926a2/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5cd1b75d-37a6-5e1f-8500-8a24b8e926a2/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5cd1b75d-37a6-5e1f-8500-8a24b8e926a2/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5cd1b75d-37a6-5e1f-8500-8a24b8e926a2/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5cd1b75d-37a6-5e1f-8500-8a24b8e926a2/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5cd1b75d-37a6-5e1f-8500-8a24b8e926a2/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5cd1b75d-37a6-5e1f-8500-8a24b8e926a2/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5cd1b75d-37a6-5e1f-8500-8a24b8e926a2/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5cd1b75d-37a6-5e1f-8500-8a24b8e926a2/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5cd1b75d-37a6-5e1f-8500-8a24b8e926a2/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5cd1b75d-37a6-5e1f-8500-8a24b8e926a2/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"5d042900-0cba-5276-88a0-6cb2e0e4e710","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5d042900-0cba-5276-88a0-6cb2e0e4e710"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"lacy-dog","name":"Lacy Dog","plural-name":"Lacy Dogs","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"In the 1858, Frank, George, Erwin, and Harry Lacy—the Lacy brothers—arrived in Marble Falls, Texas via covered wagon to establish a new homestead. The brothers needed a hardy dog to help with herding, hunting, tracking, and guarding livestock. The Lacy Dog, also known as the Blue Lacy, resulted from crossing several breeds that might have included a scenthound and the Greyhound with coyotes.\n\nThe Lacy Dog is believed to be the first breed to originate in Texas and earned the designation of Texas State Dog in 2005.\n\nThe decline in small ranches and the introduction of high-tech hunting and tracking tools have led the Lacy Dog nearer to extinction. However the breed, while still relatively unknown outside of Texas, retains all of the characteristics that made it a popular four-legged ranch hand and can still be found working alongside ranchers and hunters.","facts":"The Lacy Dog is a hardworking, alert working dog. Despite its frilly name, this is a hardy breed that needs room to run and a task to accomplish in order to satisfy its strong drive to work.","traits-appearance":"Lacy Dogs are medium-sized, muscular, active dogs with poised, alert appearances and intelligent expressions.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Lacy Dogs have smooth, tight, sleek coats with a glossy appearance.\n\nThe dogs come in three colors: Blue, red, and tri-colored. The blue Lacy is light gunmetal gray to charcoal gray in color; the red Lacy is has coloring that ranges from red and yellow to cream; and the tri-colored Lacy has the light gunmetal gray to charcoal gray coloring of a blue Lacy with red points over the eyes, on the muzzle, under the tail, and down the legs.","traits-physical":"Lacy Dogs have firm, muscular bodies with deep chests; strong loins; muscular shoulders; powerful legs and tails that are straight but can curl upward when the dog is alert. Their eyes are distinctive shades of yellow to orange (brown eyes are considered a fault).","temperament":"Lacy Dogs are a highly driven working breed with natural protective instincts and energy to spare. These dogs are happiest when engaged in high-energy tasks and, without sufficient work, can become bored and destructive.\n\nTrue to their roots, Lacy Dogs have strong herding instincts and may herd children or other pets; the same sense of smell that allowed the breed to excel at tracking prey could lead the Lacy Dog to run astray if it is not on leash or confined in a securely fenced area.","care-nutrition":"Feed Lacy Dogs a high-quality dog food that is appropriate for their life stage (puppy, adult, senior) and consider a diet formulated for active breeds. Portion out their food with a measuring up and limit treats to no more than 10 percent of their daily calories to avoid overfeeding.","care-grooming":"Thanks to their short coats, Lacy Dogs do not require much grooming. An occasional bath and brushing will help their soft, sleek coats look and feel their best. Lacy Dogs also require regular nail trims, ear cleanings, and a [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) routine that includes at-home teeth brushing and professional cleanings. Introducing these grooming essentials when Lacy Dogs are puppies can ensure they become lifelong habits.","care-exercise":"A walk around the block is not enough for a Lacy Dog. This is a high-energy working breed that prefers to be on the job—especially one that requires speed and stamina. If there are no cattle to herd or game to track, Lacy Dogs require other ways to burn off energy. They make great running or hiking companions and may enjoy swimming or agility.","care-training":"Training is a must. Lacy Dogs can be dominant, so training can help them understand their place in the pack and channel their boundless energy in positive directions. With consistent training, these intelligent, highly driven dogs can master commands and learn new tricks. They do best with calm, assertive—but never harsh—leadership, positive reinforcement, and rewards. Socialization can help the Lacy Dog feel more comfortable with unfamiliar people and situations.","care-health":null,"references":"http://www.nationalkennelclub.com/breed-standards/blue-lacy.htm\n\nhttps://lacydog.com/breed-information","reviewed-by":"Cindy Elston, DVM, MPH","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":11.3,"weight-range-pet-max":22.7,"weight-range-show-min":11.3,"weight-range-show-max":22.7,"height-range-min":46.0,"height-range-max":53.0,"life-span-range-min":12.0,"life-span-range-max":16.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":97,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":57,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":41},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5d042900-0cba-5276-88a0-6cb2e0e4e710/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5d042900-0cba-5276-88a0-6cb2e0e4e710/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5d042900-0cba-5276-88a0-6cb2e0e4e710/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5d042900-0cba-5276-88a0-6cb2e0e4e710/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5d042900-0cba-5276-88a0-6cb2e0e4e710/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5d042900-0cba-5276-88a0-6cb2e0e4e710/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5d042900-0cba-5276-88a0-6cb2e0e4e710/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5d042900-0cba-5276-88a0-6cb2e0e4e710/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5d042900-0cba-5276-88a0-6cb2e0e4e710/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5d042900-0cba-5276-88a0-6cb2e0e4e710/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5d042900-0cba-5276-88a0-6cb2e0e4e710/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5d042900-0cba-5276-88a0-6cb2e0e4e710/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5d042900-0cba-5276-88a0-6cb2e0e4e710/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5d042900-0cba-5276-88a0-6cb2e0e4e710/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5d042900-0cba-5276-88a0-6cb2e0e4e710/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5d042900-0cba-5276-88a0-6cb2e0e4e710/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5d042900-0cba-5276-88a0-6cb2e0e4e710/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5d042900-0cba-5276-88a0-6cb2e0e4e710/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"5d2afe56-f331-5e2d-9790-cd60defafd82","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5d2afe56-f331-5e2d-9790-cd60defafd82"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"mastiff","name":"Mastiff","plural-name":"Mastiffs","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"An ancestor to many modern purebred dogs, the Mastiff has been around since 2500 BC. Caesar praised the Mastiff for its fighting ability in 55 AD, and Phoenician sailors introduced the breed to England in the 6th century.\n\nThe breed participated in blood sports, such as bear-baiting, bull-baiting, lion-baiting, and dogfighting. Mastiffs also served in war. Legend has it that at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415, a Mastiff defended his wounded master, Sir Peers Legh, for many hours until he was rescued. This is just one example of what Mastiffs are known for: protecting their masters and property.\n\nThe Mastiff likely made its way to America aboard the Mayflower. But few Mastiffs were imported to the United States until the late 1800s. And after Britain passed laws in 1835 that banned baiting sports, the breed fell in popularity and began to disappear. After World War II, the Mastiff faced extinction. Fortunately, proponents of Mastiffs imported them and eventually re-established the breed.","facts":"Mastiffs are courageous, dignified, and good-natured companions that are extremely loyal to their family members. These large, protective dogs make calm and well-mannered house pets.","traits-appearance":"Huge dogs, Mastiffs weigh between 175 and 200 pounds on average.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Mastiffs have short, dense double coats of fawn, apricot, or brindle with stripes.","traits-physical":"The rectangular-shaped body of the Mastiff is heavily muscled, and the head is prominent and massive. Trademarks of this breed include a wrinkled forehead, drooping jowls, a black mask around the eyes and nose, ears that flop downward, and a tail that sits high on the rear end.","temperament":"Mastiffs may be enormous, powerful, and impressive, but they are actually gentle giants in the dog world. They have calm, patient, and affectionate personalities, are relatively quiet, and demonstrate excellent skills as guards and watchdogs. Mastiffs can be very protective of family and territory. They may be suspicious of strangers who visit the home, but they don’t bark much.\n\nThis breed is generally good with children. That being said, all dogs require supervision when children are around. Mastiffs are eager to please and love attention and companionship.","care-nutrition":"Mastiffs grow quickly. Good nutrition—especially during the first two years of life—will support healthy development. Calcium and phosphorus ratios are particularly important in preventing skeletal disorders, which are common in this breed.\n\nFree-feeding your Mastiff is not ideal, as it can lead to excessive eating and weight gain. So, scheduled meals tend to be the recommended approach.","care-grooming":"Mastiffs are easy to groom due to their short, dense coat. A quick brushing every few days is usually sufficient. Extreme shedding occurs once or twice a year. At such times, more frequent grooming with a strong, toothed comb can help remove dead hair.\n\nDeep wrinkles surround the Mastiff’s head, eyes, and muzzle. You should check and clean these (and the ears) regularly. Likewise, keep your dog’s nails short to prevent discomfort and mobility problems.\n\nFinally, Mastiffs are the drooling type. So, you might want to have a spare cloth handy at all times for wiping.","care-exercise":"Mastiffs have relatively low exercise needs, and they can be quite the couch potato. But regular exercise is best for their health and happiness. Dog sports such as agility, carting, rally and competitive obedience, weight pull, and tracking are all great options for keeping your Mastiff active.","care-training":"Mastiffs are quite food-motivated and respond well to [reward-based training techniques](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-obedience-training). Conversely, loud commands and forceful measures tend to activate the Mastiff’s stubborn tendencies.\n\n[Early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) with people and other pets is also critical for helping your Mastiff grow into a well-rounded, friendly

Asian Ovcharka","plural-name":"Central Asian Ovcharkas","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The Central Asian Ovcharka has a fascinating history; experts believe that it dates back over 5,000 years, making it one of the oldest known groups of dogs.\n\nUnlike other breeds, the Central Asian Ovcharka developed out of necessity. This breed is particularly adaptable to their terrain, and you'll find different individual breed types of Ovcharka throughout Central Asia based on the area's geography.\n\nThe former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) gets credit for standardizing the breed in the 1920s; after the USSR dissolved, the modern version became the Central Asian Ovcharka.\n\nToday, these dogs are still used as guard dogs by nomadic tribes, as they are incredibly territorial and possessive of their people and area.","facts":"The Central Asian Ovcharka is a unique breed, created by the climate of their native land. These dogs are territorial guard dogs that are protective of their property and their people. They are a large and powerful breed, but they are loyal and loving with the people they know and trust.","traits-appearance":"The Central Asian Ovcharka has different characteristics depending on where they live; most Central Asian Ovcharkas are possessive and territorial.\n\nTheir massive size—up to 150 pounds—can be intimidating. Once they've bonded to you, however, the Central Asian Ovcharka is loyal and loving, if not somewhat needy.\n\nThe breed is generally large, moderately long, and robust with triangular ears, a deep, broad chest, and a thick tail carried in a sickle curve or curled in a loose ring.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Central Asian Ovcharka has a straight, coarse undercoat with short, dense hair on the head and front of the limbs. The outer coat can be short or long, and they can be any color except blue and brown in any combination and black mantle on tan.","traits-physical":"Weighing in at around 150 pounds, the Central Asian Ovcharka's domineering size is its most distinctive physical trait. This muscular breed generally requires little grooming throughout the year, but when they do shed once a year, it's often referred to as a \"fur storm.\"","temperament":"The Central Asian Ovcharka is not a breed for the first-time pet parent, and it's not suited to apartment life because of their size.\n\nThis breed is stubborn, fiercely protective, and territorial; they love to dig and bark, and require a lot of attention from their families.\n\nWith the proper training, though, the Central Asian Ovcharka makes a good companion and excellent watchdog for the seasoned dog owner who is willing to be patient and give this breed the proper attention and care that it craves.","care-nutrition":"The Central Asian Ovcharka is an extra-large breed. Because of this, it requires a well-proportioned and highly nutritious diet, unique for its digestive needs and any additional health concerns.\n\nIt's important to monitor the amount of food and treats that you give your Central Asian Ovcharka, especially since some dogs may be prone to gaining weight as they age. Your veterinarian is always a good source to help provide you with appropriate nutrition and feeding guidelines.","care-grooming":"In general, the Central Asian Ovcharka is a breed that requires little care for its coarse coat, and a once-weekly grooming and occasional bath should suffice.\n\nOn the once-a-year-occasion when the breed sheds, however, it's often referred to as a \"fur storm,\" and daily grooming will become necessary.\n\nAll dogs require regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care), including at-home teeth brushing and professional dental cleanings, and the Central Asian Ovcharka is no exception. Maintaining good dental hygiene is important for their overall long-term health.","care-exercise":"The Central Asian Ovcharka is a low-energy dog, but they require a daily walk or round of play in a fenced-in area to stay healthy.\n\nYou must always keep this breed on a leash—they're independent and can take off at a moment's notice, especially if they feel any sense of danger.","care-training":"The Central Asian Ovcharka is a strong-willed, independent breed; these qualities, while useful in guarding, can make it challenging to train. Training is essential, however, because this breed is very territorial and protective.\n\nEven with the proper training, the Central Asian Ovcharka will likely be wary of strangers, so having guests over might be difficult.","care-health":null,"references":"http://centralasianshepherd.homestead.com/breedinformationcentralasianshepherddog.html\n\nhttps://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/central-asian-shepherd-dog/\n\nhttp://www.fci.be/Nomenclature/Standards/335g02-en.pdf","reviewed-by":"Cindy Elston, DVM, MPH","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":39.9,"weight-range-pet-max":54.4,"weight-range-show-min":39.9,"weight-range-show-max":54.4,"height-range-min":61.0,"height-range-max":79.0,"life-span-range-min":12.0,"life-span-range-max":15.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":78,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":50,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":35},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5defdb51-27d1-56cb-9c32-16c19e47d12c/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5defdb51-27d1-56cb-9c32-16c19e47d12c/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5defdb51-27d1-56cb-9c32-16c19e47d12c/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5defdb51-27d1-56cb-9c32-16c19e47d12c/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5defdb51-27d1-56cb-9c32-16c19e47d12c/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5defdb51-27d1-56cb-9c32-16c19e47d12c/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5defdb51-27d1-56cb-9c32-16c19e47d12c/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5defdb51-27d1-56cb-9c32-16c19e47d12c/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5defdb51-27d1-56cb-9c32-16c19e47d12c/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5defdb51-27d1-56cb-9c32-16c19e47d12c/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5defdb51-27d1-56cb-9c32-16c19e47d12c/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5defdb51-27d1-56cb-9c32-16c19e47d12c/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5defdb51-27d1-56cb-9c32-16c19e47d12c/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5defdb51-27d1-56cb-9c32-16c19e47d12c/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5defdb51-27d1-56cb-9c32-16c19e47d12c/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5defdb51-27d1-56cb-9c32-16c19e47d12c/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5defdb51-27d1-56cb-9c32-16c19e47d12c/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5defdb51-27d1-56cb-9c32-16c19e47d12c/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"5e17544e-2a05-51c4-9b27-faa97c894056","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5e17544e-2a05-51c4-9b27-faa97c894056"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"spanish-greyhound","name":"Spanish Greyhound","plural-name":"Spanish Greyhounds","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"Spanish Greyhounds (or Galgos Español) originated on the Spanish plains, where they hunted hares, rabbits, and occasionally fox or boar. The Galgueros, or Galgo hunters, bred the dogs for centuries.\n\nIn the early 20th century, breeders reportedly crossed the Spanish Greyhound with the English Greyhound to increase their racing speed. Today, they remain uniquely Spanish, but regional variations exist, depending on the local terrain.\n\nOther fun facts about this breed? It's featured on a Roman denarius coin, and a Spanish Greyhound famously appears in the novel\n\nThe United Kennel Club recognized the Spanish Greyhound in 2006.","facts":"The Spanish Greyhound is a gentle and sensitive athlete. Though typically reserved, these dogs make energetic, lively hunters. Like other sighthounds, they tend to be affectionate toward their people and don't mind spending most of the day napping on the couch.","traits-appearance":"Spanish Greyhounds are medium-to-large, well-muscled, compactly built dogs.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Spanish Greyhound's coat is made up of smooth, fine, short hair. It's slightly longer on the backs of the thighs and can form facial furnishings—such as a beard or mustache. The coat comes in all colors and may be solid, flecked, bridle, or pied.","traits-physical":"Spanish Greyhounds have long, narrow heads and muzzles. Their almond-shaped eyes are commonly dark hazel and offer a calm, soft expression. They have tucked-up bellies and long tails that form a hook at the tip.","temperament":"Spanish Greyhounds are gentle and affectionate dogs that make excellent companions. They form close bonds with their families but can be a little shy around strangers. They also have a reputation for being good with other animals they're raised with—including cats. However, these dogs may chase smaller outdoor animals due to their sighthound instincts.\n\nThough they need to run regularly, Spanish Greyhounds like to sleep a lot during the day (preferably on a soft couch). And as long as they get their daily exercise, they can make good apartment dogs thanks to their quiet, low-key personalities. To help prevent separation anxiety, be sure to expose your pup to some alone time when they are young.","care-nutrition":"Spanish Greyhounds need high-quality food appropriate for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). To help them stay at a healthy weight, carefully measure out their meals, and limit treats to no more than 10% of their calories.\n\nThese dogs are at a greater risk than most breeds for bloat (also known as twisted stomach). To help prevent bloat, break your dog's food up into several meals a day, and use a food bowl specially designed to slow their eating. When timing meals, avoid feeding your pup immediately before or after any vigorous activity.\n\nThese are just a few ways you can help prevent this life-threatening condition. Ask your veterinarian about other ways—including surgical options—to prevent bloat.","care-grooming":"The Spanish Greyhound's short coat is easy to maintain. Weekly brushing with a hound mitt or rubber curry brush will keep it looking its best. Nail trims, ear cleanings, and regular dental care—including at-home teeth brushing and professional cleanings—should also be part of your grooming routines.","care-exercise":"Spanish Greyhounds love to go for runs and walks. But when your pup is off-leash, be sure to limit any outdoor activity to an enclosed area. These dogs make good jogging partners and enjoy canine sports—such as lure coursing, racing, agility, and competitive obedience.","care-training":"Typical of sighthounds, Spanish Greyhounds respond best to positive and reward-based training methods. They may also require careful socialization to prevent or reduce fear-based defensive behaviors. Starting this socialization when in puppyhood will help your Spanish Greyhound develop into a well-adjusted, well-mannered adult dog.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.ukcdogs.com/spanish-greyhound\n\nhttp://www.vetstreet.com/dogs/spanish-greyhound#overview\n","reviewed-by":"Annette Louviere, DVM","date-reviewed":"2020-09-05T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":20.0,"weight-range-pet-max":29.9,"weight-range-show-min":20.0,"weight-range-show-max":29.9,"height-range-min":61.0,"height-range-max":71.0,"life-span-range-min":12.0,"life-span-range-max":15.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":null,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":null,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":null},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5e17544e-2a05-51c4-9b27-faa97c894056/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5e17544e-2a05-51c4-9b27-faa97c894056/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5e17544e-2a05-51c4-9b27-faa97c894056/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5e17544e-2a05-51c4-9b27-faa97c894056/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5e17544e-2a05-51c4-9b27-faa97c894056/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5e17544e-2a05-51c4-9b27-faa97c894056/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5e17544e-2a05-51c4-9b27-faa97c894056/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5e17544e-2a05-51c4-9b27-faa97c894056/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5e17544e-2a05-51c4-9b27-faa97c894056/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5e17544e-2a05-51c4-9b27-faa97c894056/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5e17544e-2a05-51c4-9b27-faa97c894056/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5e17544e-2a05-51c4-9b27-faa97c894056/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5e17544e-2a05-51c4-9b27-faa97c894056/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5e17544e-2a05-51c4-9b27-faa97c894056/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5e17544e-2a05-51c4-9b27-faa97c894056/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5e17544e-2a05-51c4-9b27-faa97c894056/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5e17544e-2a05-51c4-9b27-faa97c894056/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5e17544e-2a05-51c4-9b27-faa97c894056/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"5eab3310-c5ea-5b35-9cb3-5c2bc8619a7f","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5eab3310-c5ea-5b35-9cb3-5c2bc8619a7f"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"oriental-longhair","name":"Oriental Longhair","plural-name":null,"published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"cat","history":"Thanks to breeders' goal of developing every possible combination of coat colors and patterns within a single breed, Oriental Longhairs are among the world's most diverse cat breeds.\n\nCat breeding saw a dramatic decline during World War II. As breeders started up again after the war, they experimented with unique crosses that yielded many modern cat breeds—including the Oriental Longhair.\n\nIn the 1950s, breeders crossed Russian Blues, British Shorthairs, Abyssinians, and regular domestic cats with the Siamese. These litters were then bred with Siamese, which produced pointed and non-pointed kittens. In just a few generations, these cats were indistinguishable from the Siamese, except for their coloring. And the non-pointed cats from these breedings formed the foundation of the Oriental breed.\n\nAt first, different colored cats had unique breed names. But when the number of colors continued to grow, breeders decided to combine all non-pointed cats into one breed—the Oriental.\n\nOrientals come in both a short and long coat length. The Longhair alone comes in hundreds of different color and pattern combinations. So, there's bound to be an Oriental Longhair that appeals to everyone.","facts":"Oriental Longhairs are part of the Siamese breed group. They're social, intelligent, talkative cats that thrive in active households that provide them with plenty of attention.","traits-appearance":"Oriental Longhairs are medium-sized cats with a svelte but muscular build. They have long, tapering lines and graceful bodies that give the impression of strength without bulk.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Oriental Longhair's coat is semi-long and lies close to the body. Below the fine, silky topcoat is a slight undercoat. All coat patterns and colors—including solid, shaded, smoke, parti-color, bi-color, pointed, or tabby patterned—are possible.","traits-physical":"Oriental Longhairs have a long, tapering wedge-shaped head and flat skull. Their nose is a long, straight continuation of the forehead, with no break. Almond-shaped eyes slant toward the nose and come in blue, green, or one of each. These cats have large, pointed ears that are wide at the base.\n\nThe Oriental's slender neck, lithe body, slim legs, and thin, tapering tail are long and graceful, whereas their paws are small and dainty.","temperament":"Oriental Longhairs are social—and sometimes demanding—cats that thrive on human companionship. They do well in homes where they can engage with plenty of other pets or people (including kids).\n\nOrientals like to be where the action is, and they aren't shy about letting you know when they want more attention. Highly vocal, they're known to follow their humans around the house, carrying on a (sometimes one-sided) conversation. They don't like to be left alone—and can get into mischief when they are. So, many people get a pair of Orientals to keep each other entertained.\n\nThese cats keep their kitten-like attitude their entire lives. They love to play and often pick out a preferred toy. They can also learn to play fetch or participate in feline agility. Tall cat trees are essential for this intelligent, agile, and curious breed.\n\nAfter an active day, Orientals love to curl up on a warm bed or on the lap of their favorite person.","care-nutrition":"Orientals need a high-quality diet formulated for their life stage (e.g., kitten, adult, senior). Because all cats are at risk of obesity, measure out meals and reduce portions if necessary. And don't forget to account for calories from treats in their daily totals. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of a cat's calories.\n\nFinally, all cats need access to fresh, clean water around the clock.","care-grooming":"Despite its moderate length, the Oriental Longhair's coat sheds minimally and isn't prone to mats or tangles. Weekly brushing is typically sufficient to remove any loose hair and keep your cat looking their best.\n\nMost cats' nails require monthly trimming to prevent them from getting too long. Long nails are more likely to snag on something and become torn or damaged. They can even grow into your cat's paw pads, leading to pain or infection. In addition to clipping, providing a scratching post will allow your cat to do some nail maintenance themselves (thanks to their instinct to scratch).\n\nNo grooming routine is complete without a little dental hygiene. To support your Oriental's overall health, brush their teeth daily and schedule visits with your veterinarian for professional dental cleanings and exams.","care-exercise":null,"care-training":null,"care-health":"Some breeds are more susceptible to certain health conditions. Oriental Longhairs may be prone to Amyloidosis—a disease caused by a build-up of an abnormal protein in the heart, liver, kidney, or other organs. They can also be sensitive to anesthesia. Your veterinarian is the best resource for questions about these and other health concerns for your cat.","references":"https://cfa.org/oriental/\n\nhttps://www.tica.org/breeds/browse-all-breeds?view=article&id=1286:the-oriental-longhair-breed&catid=48\n\nhttps://www.royalcanin.com/us/cats/breeds/breed-library/oriental\n\nhttps://cfa.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/oriental-standard.pdf\n\nhttps://www.banfield.com/pet-healthcare/additional-resources/article-library/conditions-illnesses/understanding-the-health-risks-of-obesity","reviewed-by":"Laura

Inca Orchid","plural-name":"Peruvian Inca Orchids","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The Peruvian Inca Orchid (PIO) is an ancient breed that dates as far back as 350 BC. Evidence of these dogs appeared on Moche, Chimu, Chancay, and Incan pottery. Interestingly, their urine was used in medicine and their body warmth was used to treat arthritis and respiratory conditions. On top of that, some people believed the breed brought good luck. Not bad for a little hairless dog!\n\nAfter the Conquistadors overtook Peru, breeders crossed these small pups with larger dogs from other countries. And over time, this process resulted in the three distinct breed sizes that exist today.\n\nJack Walklin brought eight dogs from Peru to America in 1966 and used them to establish the breed—which he dubbed the Peruvian Inca Orchid—in the U.S. The PIO has been registered with the FCI since 1981 and has been eligible to compete in the AKC's Miscellaneous Class since 2011.","facts":"Intelligent and elegant, the Peruvian Inca Orchid makes a good hunting dog and affectionate family companion. Though the breed comes in a coated variety, hairless Orchids are the most common—and the most memorable.","traits-appearance":"Peruvian Inca Orchids are unique-looking sighthounds with an elegant, slim build. They come in small, medium, and large sizes and can be hairless (the most common type) or coated. The hairless variety almost always has an incomplete set of teeth.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Hairless PIOs have just a few short hairs on the head and small patches on the lower tail and feet. Their skin can be any solid color or spotted with unpigmented areas.\n\nThe coated variety's hair length is short or medium with feathering on the neck, ears, and body. All coat colors are accepted under the breed standard.","traits-physical":"PIOs have alert, intelligent expressions and strong, muscular bodies. Hairless Orchids feature “prick” or upright ears when on alert, whereas the coated variety has only semi-prick ears. Both types have low-set tails that the dogs carry raised in a round curve above the back when excited.","temperament":"Peruvian Inca Orchids are loyal dogs and very affectionate with their humans. They can, however, be wary around strangers and aren't the best choice for families with very small (and thus unpredictable) children.\n\nThese playful pups enjoy trips to the park and outings with the family. But they're not well-suited for full-time life outdoors. They also require [early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) and training to help them develop into well-mannered, predictable pets.\n\nSighthounds like the PIO can have a strong prey drive and are very fast. So, they should be supervised when around cats and other pets and kept on a leash if any animals they might mistake for prey are nearby.","care-nutrition":"Peruvian Inca Orchids thrive on high-quality food that's appropriate for their life stage. To help your dog maintain their slim physique, keep an eye on the amount of food you give them. And don't forget to account for treats. Ideally, they should make up no more than 10% of a dog's daily calorie intake.","care-grooming":"Hairless Orchids don't require brushing, of course, but they do still need occasional baths to stay clean. They also should wear sunscreen to protect their skin when outside on sunny days.\n\nCoated Orchids need weekly brushing to remove loose fur and keep them looking their best. Both types need regular nail trims and ear cleanings as part of their standard care.\n\nLastly, good [dental hygiene](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) will support your dog's overall health. Dental disease is one of the most common health conditions in adult dogs. Left untreated, it can contribute to other serious issues. In addition to professional cleanings, establish an at-home dental care program that includes regular teeth brushing and veterinarian-recommended dental chews.","care-exercise":"PIOs are energetic dogs that need daily exercise to stay in tip-top shape. Backyard play sessions, brisk walks, and games of hide-and-seek are all good ways for them to stay active. They also enjoy—and are good at—agility, lure coursing, and rally work.","care-training":"Though intelligent, Peruvian Inca Orchids can be difficult to train. They require a firm, consistent approach that uses positive reinforcement to reward desired behaviors.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/peruvian-inca-orchid/\n\nhttp://cdn.akc.org/PeruvianIncaOrchid.pdf","reviewed-by":"Jamie Freyer, DVM","date-reviewed":"2021-07-09T19:21:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":4.0,"weight-range-pet-max":25.0,"weight-range-show-min":4.0,"weight-range-show-max":25.0,"height-range-min":25.0,"height-range-max":65.0,"life-span-range-min":10.0,"life-span-range-max":12.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":null,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":null,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":null},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5f640875-1c0b-56c5-876a-1009653498a4/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5f640875-1c0b-56c5-876a-1009653498a4/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5f640875-1c0b-56c5-876a-1009653498a4/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5f640875-1c0b-56c5-876a-1009653498a4/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5f640875-1c0b-56c5-876a-1009653498a4/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5f640875-1c0b-56c5-876a-1009653498a4/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5f640875-1c0b-56c5-876a-1009653498a4/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5f640875-1c0b-56c5-876a-1009653498a4/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5f640875-1c0b-56c5-876a-1009653498a4/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5f640875-1c0b-56c5-876a-1009653498a4/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5f640875-1c0b-56c5-876a-1009653498a4/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5f640875-1c0b-56c5-876a-1009653498a4/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5f640875-1c0b-56c5-876a-1009653498a4/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5f640875-1c0b-56c5-876a-1009653498a4/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5f640875-1c0b-56c5-876a-1009653498a4/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5f640875-1c0b-56c5-876a-1009653498a4/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5f640875-1c0b-56c5-876a-1009653498a4/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5f640875-1c0b-56c5-876a-1009653498a4/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"5fd39a9a-a3d9-52f7-bce6-c71fd0c53f53","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/5fd39a9a-a3d9-52f7-bce6-c71fd0c53f53"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"burmilla","name":"Burmilla","plural-name":null,"published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"cat","history":"Love was in the air in the summer of 1981. That's when a female Lilac Burmese found her way to a male Chinchilla Persian (mere days before his scheduled neutering).\n\nThe result of that chance meeting was a litter of shorthaired black shaded silver kittens. The kittens' owner—a British baroness who already bred Persians—found them so attractive that she decided to build a program to develop what became known as the Burmilla.\n\nBurmillas come in both longhair and shorthair varieties. The breed first gained recognition in the U.K. in the 1990s, but it's still very rare today.","facts":"Burmillas are best known for their shimmery silver coats. But these cats also have a charming personality, inquisitive nature, and easygoing attitude—making them irresistible family pets.","traits-appearance":"The Burmilla is a medium-sized cat with an elegant appearance and sparkling silver coat. This breed shares many physical characteristics with the Burmese, but it has a sweeter, more open expression.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Shorthair Burmillas have a silky, smooth-lying coat with enough undercoat to give a slight lift. Longhair Burmillas have semi-long coats, ear tufts, furnishings, and tail plumes. Unlike the shorthairs, they don't have a wooly undercoat.\n\nThe Burmilla's coat patterns are chinchilla silver, chinchilla gold, shaded silver, and shaded gold. They come in a variety of colors—including lilac, blue, chocolate, and cream.","traits-physical":"Burmilla's have a wedge-shaped head that's wide at the cheekbones and tapers to a blunt muzzle. They have medium-to-large ears with slightly rounded tips, and their large, heavily outlined eyes come in shades of green. Slender legs, neat, oval paws, and a medium-long tail complete their elegant look.","temperament":"Burmillas are family-oriented cats with an independent, mischievous nature. They crave attention and can be quite demanding if they feel their humans are stingy with their affection. But they make up for any pushiness with their fun-loving and sweet personalities.\n\nKnown for maintaining their kitten-like energy well into adulthood, Burmese make excellent playmates and entertainers. These quiet, gentle cats also get along well with other household pets and kids. But they can take a little time to warm up to visitors.","care-nutrition":"Burmillas require a high-quality diet. Because nutritional needs vary for kittens, adults, and senior cats, opt for a formula that's age-appropriate for your pet.\n\nTo keep your cat at a healthy weight, measure out meals and reduce portions if necessary. And don't forget to account for calories from treats in their daily totals. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of a cat's calories.\n\nFinally, all cats need access to fresh, clean water around the clock.","care-grooming":"Burmillas' grooming needs are relatively minimal. Weekly brushing is generally sufficient to remove loose hair and prevent mats or tangles.\n\nMost cats' nails require monthly trimming to prevent them from getting too long.

Egypt. Like all dogs, they are descendants of domesticated wolves. But unlike purebred dogs that people have explicitly bred to strengthen specific traits, Egyptian street dogs don't belong to a particular breed. Instead, they've evolved naturally in their native environment over centuries.\n\nThe number of these semi-feral dogs that wander the streets in Egypt has grown over the years. Because locals often prefer purebred dogs, many view Egyptian street dogs as a nuisance in their neighborhoods. Rescue organizations have launched spay and neuter campaigns to help curb the population of street dogs and worked with international groups to find homes for them overseas.","facts":"Egyptian street dogs are free-roaming pups that typically congregate in cities or towns with plentiful resources. They share many basic traits with pet dogs, but they lead primarily independent lives outdoors.","traits-appearance":"Though Egyptian street dogs tend to be thin, medium-sized dogs with long legs, they can come in all shapes and sizes.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Egyptian street dogs typically have short, brown or beige coats. But any combination of coat colors, patterns, and lengths is possible.","traits-physical":"Since street dogs do not follow a breed standard, they have no shared set of traits that link them together. That said, common characteristics include large, prick ears, pointed noses, and curled tails.","temperament":"Egyptian street dogs must learn to fend for themselves. As a result, they tend to be scrappy, intelligent, and adaptable—all skills that support independent survival. Because they've never had to rely on humans, they may be fearful or skeptical of people who have not earned their trust.\n\nBut people who have taken in Egyptian street dogs find that—once they become comfortable in their new home—they make playful, loyal pets and excellent guard dogs.","care-nutrition":"An Egyptian street dog's diet typically consists of whatever they can kill or find—small farm animals, scraps from trash cans, handouts from kind strangers, and so on. If you're leaving food out for a street dog, they'll benefit from commercial diets formulated for pet dogs.\n\nBecause they fend for themselves, street dogs aren't usually at risk of becoming overweight. However, if you take a street dog under your roof, keep an eye on their food intake to avoid overfeeding. Guidelines on dog food packages are a good starting point when determining daily portions.","care-grooming":"If you've adopted a street dog that's comfortable being handled, regular brushing and nail trims will help them look their best. Good [dental hygiene](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) is also important for any dog.

Egyptian street dogs that are on their own will get adequate exercise during their daily roaming. Pet dogs, however, need access to the outdoors to stretch their legs and get mental stimulation. Playing in a fenced yard and going for leashed walks are great ways for your dog to release energy.","care-training":"Street dogs are not accustomed to obeying commands from people. In fact, many may avoid close contact with humans. Before attempting a training program, start by building trust and respect with your dog.

At some point, a number of wolves became domesticated (but experts disagree on exactly when and how) and integrated into humans' daily lives.\n\nBy the 19th century, people began recording their efforts to selectively breed dogs for certain traits—a practice that led to the hundreds of purebred dogs we know and love today. But the majority of dogs around the world do not belong to a particular breed. This includes Lebanese street dogs.\n\nThese semi-feral dogs roam the streets, often fending for themselves. Local officials estimate there are tens of thousands of street dogs in Lebanon currently. Unfortunately, many of them suffer inhumane treatment at the hands of people who historically have not viewed dogs as pets.\n\nDog ownership is a relatively new trend in Lebanon. During the country's civil war, dogs had a stigma, so few people kept them as pets. Though that's starting to change, there's still work to be done to combat negative stereotypes about dogs and educate the community on responsible treatment of animals.","facts":"Lebanese street dogs are free-roaming pups that typically congregate in cities or towns with plentiful resources.

Aside from different coat types, the breeds are so similar that they were once considered a single breed. The Belgian Tervuren, named for village of Tervuren that master breeder M.F. Corbeel called home, is also known as the Chien de Berger Belge in Belgium.\n\nThe Belgian Tervuren is an alert, attentive, skilled working dog with stamina to spare. Farmers relied on the breed to herd and guard their stock. As farming became more mechanized, the dogs were dispatched to other roles in military and police K9 units, search and rescue squads, and as service dogs.","facts":"The Belgian Tervuren is a confident and intelligent working dog. These agile, alert dogs have boundless energy and are affectionate and possessive with their loved ones.","traits-appearance":"Belgian Tervurens are strong, agile, muscular dogs. Their bodies are similar in length and height and their topline, forelegs, and hind legs giving them a square appearance. Males appear strong and masculine while females have daintier appearances.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Belgian Tervuren is a double-coated dog with a dense undercoat and long, straight, abundant, and close-fitting overcoats their guard hairs are of medium harshness, not silky or wiry. Their hair is shorter on the head, ears, and front parts of the legs and longer around the neck, forming a collarette; the hair on their tails and breeches is longer, too.\n\nThe coloring on Belgian Tervurens includes rich fawn to russet mahogany with black overlay on their bodies. Their coat is doubly pigmented with black on the tips of their fawn hairs. The hair on their chests is black but can also be a mixture of black and gray, while the underparts of their bodies, including the breeches, are cream, gray, or light beige. The tail typically has a darker or black tip. White is permitted on the chest for show, but must not extend more than three inches above the prosternum, and not to reach either point of shoulder. Belgian Tervurens have black masks on their faces and their ears are mostly black.\n\nAlthough their coloring becomes darker with age and the breed standard provides allowances for younger dogs, the absence of black coloring on mature dogs is considered a serious fault.","traits-physical":"These are medium-sized working dogs with deep chests, short, strong loins, and muscular forequarters. Belgian Tervurens also have moderately pointed muzzles; triangular ears that are stiff and erect; and brown, medium-sized, almond-shaped eyes with an alert, attentive expression and an intelligent gaze.","temperament":"Belgian Tervurens are confident, protective, and reserved with strangers but not aggressive. With their owners, these dogs are known for being affectionate, zealous for attention, responsive to commands, and eager to please.\n\nBelgian Tervurens have strong predatory instincts that can lead them to chase cars, children, and small animals. They are best suited to homes with older (or no) children and with well-socialized dogs of similar size.","care-nutrition":"Feed Belgian Tervurens a high-quality dog food that is appropriate for their life stage (puppy, adult, senior) and consider a diet formulated for active breeds. Like other breeds, Belgian Tervuren could become overweight if their food intake is not monitored. Portion out their food with a standard measuring cup and limit treats to no more than 10% of their daily calories to avoid overfeeding.","care-grooming":"Belgian Tervurens have medium-length, waterproof coats that are a snap to maintain. Brush them at least once per week to remove dead hair and reduce shedding. During semi-annual “shedding season” when the breed blows its coat, daily brushing and regular baths can help. Trim their nails to prevent cracking, splitting and painful overgrowths, and clean their ears. Regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) that includes at-home teeth brushing and professional cleanings is also an essential part of their grooming routines.","care-exercise":"When it comes to exercise, Belgian Tervurens believe more is better. This working breed has stamina to spare and loves spending time doing high-energy activities with its owners. They are ideal companions for hiking, running, and swimming and excel in dog sports like agility, tracking, herding, and obedience. Due to their strong prey drive, these dogs might not make the best companions at the dog park.\n\nLeft alone for too long (or without enough exercise) Belgian Tervurens could develop behavior problems. Provide mental stimulation with games like hide-and-seek, puzzle toys, or other interactive activities to ensure that Belgian Tervurens have mental and physical stimulation.","care-training":"Training is a must for this intelligent, self-assured breed. These dogs see training as a job and want to master tasks, but they are also known for having mischievous senses of humor and may try to outsmart their owners. Obedience training can help Belgian Tervurens channel their energy in positive directions and may help control their herding instincts; socialization can encourage the breed to be more accepting of strangers. Learning basic commands and new tricks also provides important mental stimulation.\n\nThe Belgian Tervuren is a surprisingly sensitive breed that responds best to positive reinforcement and rewards-based training.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/belgian-tervuren/\n\nhttp://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/BelgianTervuren.pdf","reviewed-by":"Laura

","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The Stabyhoun is one of the rarest dog breeds in the world. Established in the Netherlands in the 1800s, Stabys originated as all-around farm dogs. Because poor farmers in the Friesland forest land couldn't afford more than one dog, they needed a breed capable of doing a variety of jobs. And Stabyhouns rose to the challenge.\n\nHunting, protecting livestock and property, ridding the farm of pesky vermin—these dogs could do it all. The Stabyhoun's versatility is likely how it got its name. The word Stabyhoun comes from the words sta mij bij or \"stand by me,\" and houn is the Frisian word for dog.\n\nThe United States' first litter of Stabyhouns was born in 1994, and the American Kennel Club recorded the breed in its Foundation Stock Service just over a decade later.","facts":"The Stabyhoun is a brave, even-tempered, intelligent breed. Originally bred to be multipurpose working dogs, these Dutch pups are now known as national treasures in their native land. And throughout the rest of the world, they're famous for being gentle, loyal family dogs.","traits-appearance":"The Stabyhoun is a powerfully built pointing dog. Longer than it is tall, the Staby has a balanced, functional body.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Though feathering on the chest, collar, forelegs, trousers, and tail give the impression of a long-haired coat, the Stabyhoun's coat is actually medium-length with a weather-resistant undercoat. The color is a beautiful black or brown and white that sometimes features roaning or ticking (spotting).","traits-physical":"Male Stabyhouns have slightly heavier heads compared to the more refined head of females. Both sexes have somewhat rounded eyes that are either dark brown in dogs with black and white coats, or a lighter brown in dogs with brown and white coats.\n\nThe Staby's ears are moderately long and shaped like a trowel with a rounded point. The breed's bushy tail is round and covered up to the tip with long, dense hair.","temperament":"The Stabyhoun is an excellent breed for families wanting a loyal, patient, gentle dog that's good with other pets and kids. These happy, friendly pups can sometimes be energetic, But they make calm housemates when they get enough exercise and attention.\n\nStabyhouns have always had an independent nature. It's what compelled them to go off on their own to hunt for rabbits and moles on the farm. That independent streak remains today. And it's not uncommon for a Staby to hunt or chase wildlife or dig in the backyard.\n\nOne of this breed's many original jobs was to protect livestock and property. For this reason, Stabys are likely to bark if they feel they need to alert their people to something.","care-nutrition":"Stabyhouns need high-quality food that's appropriate for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior) and activity level. To keep your Stabyhoun at an ideal weight, keep an eye on their food intake. And don't forget to include calories from treats. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of a dog's calories.","care-grooming":"The Stabyhoun's coat sheds dirt naturally. So, keeping it clean is an easy job. In fact, Stabys rarely need baths. Weekly brushing is usually enough to keep their coats looking their best. But during seasonal shedding, you may need to brush more frequently.\n\nYou should also trim nails regularly to keep them at a short, tidy length. Nails that get too long can cause discomfort or lead to problems walking.\n\nFinally, maintaining good [dental hygiene](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) is essential for any dog's long-term health. In addition to scheduling professional dental cleanings, establish an at-home care routine that includes regular (ideally daily) teeth brushing.","care-exercise":"Though the Stabyhoun can be calm indoors, they prefer to have plenty of activity. Walks, jogs, or hikes with the family can be fun forms of exercise for Stabys since they love being around people.\n\nCanine sports—such as field trials, agility, tracking, and obedience—are also great ways to provide a physical and mental workout.","care-training":"Stabyhouns are intelligent, responsive dogs that are eager to please. However, they can be headstrong. Patient and consistent training starting when they're young is key. This breed responds well to gentle, reward-based obedience training using favorite treats and toys.\n\nTo help your Stabyhoun grow into a well-mannered adult dog, you should also [socialize them early

Mastiff","plural-name":"Pyrenean Mastiffs","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The Pyrenean Mastiff's origins are relatively unknown, though experts believe the breed descends from molosser dogs that arrived in the Pyrenees Mountains 3,000 years ago. Each isolated mountain region developed a unique livestock guardian breed from the molosser dogs, including the Pyrenean Mastiff, Spanish Mastiff, and Great Pyrenees.\n\nDuring the migration of flocks to and from grazing grounds in the Aragon region of Spain in 504 A.D., shepherds traveled with a small pack of Pyrenean Mastiffs. The herds had more than a thousand sheep, which the dogs expertly protected from bears and wolves in the mountains and foothills.\n\nThough the dogs excelled as flock guardians for centuries, their numbers plummeted in the mid-20th century as the Spanish Civil War and World War II led to decreased reliance on guardian dogs. When a pack of wolves returned to the Aragon region in the 1970s, shepherds reintroduced guardian dogs to the mountains.\n\nBreed enthusiasts have also worked hard to restore Pyrenean Mastiff populations from 30 prime Pyrenean Mastiff specimens. The breed is still rare but has rebounded to more than 4,000 dogs around the world.","facts":"Pyrenean Mastiffs are certainly gentle giants. The guardian breed is known for its gentle, calm, good-natured demeanor and outsized love for its family.","traits-appearance":"Pyrenean Mastiffs are large dogs of above-average size, muscular builds, and firm bone structures. Despite their large, strong bodies, they never look heavy or sluggish.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Pyrenean Mastiffs have dense, thick, medium-length hair that is longer on their shoulders, necks, underbellies, back of legs, and tails.\n\nTheir coats are bristly, not woolly in texture; the plumes of hair on their tails have a less bristly texture than the rest of their bodies.\n\nThe primary color of the Pyrenean Mastiffs is white. These dogs have well-defined masks and may have irregularly distributed, distinctly outlined patches on their bodies that are the same color as their masks.\n\nThe most desired shade of the base coat is white, while the most desired shades of patches are medium gray, intense golden yellow, brown, black, grey-silver, light beige, sandy, or marble. Their ears are always spotted; the tips of their tails and lower parts of their legs are always white.","traits-physical":"Pyrenean Mastiffs have powerful, robust, rectangular bodies with muscular backs, broad, deep chests, and pronounced withers. Their strong, flexible tails are set medium-high and are thick at the root with soft hair that forms a plume.\n\nPyrenean Mastiffs also have medium-sized, triangular-shaped ears that hang flat and small, almond-shaped eyes that convey an alert, noble, and intelligent expression but can be stern toward an opponent.","temperament":"Pyrenean Mastiffs are natural guardians that will never back down from a challenge.\n\nIn their homes, these great protectors are friendly, calm, and even-tempered; they are welcoming to friends and family, love children, and only show their protective instincts when there is truly a threat. Pyrenean Mastiffs do bark—a loud, deep rumble—to warn off danger but are mostly calm and laid back.\n\nTheir natural guardian tendencies extend toward other animals, making these dogs great companions for other pets.\n\nLike other mastiffs, Pyrenean Mastiffs drool profusely. The soggy mess is a small price to pay for their love, loyalty, and protection.","care-nutrition":"Offer Pyrenean Mastiffs a high-quality dog food that is appropriate for their life stage (puppy, adult, senior) and consider a diet formulated for large breed dogs. Portion out their food with a measuring cup and limit treats to 10 percent of their daily calories to prevent overfeeding.","care-grooming":"Brush Pyrenean Mastiffs every few days to prevent mats and tangles and reduce shedding. These dogs will need daily brushing during semi-annual “shedding seasons.” A de-shedding tool can help remove their undercoats in the spring and fall.\n\nPyrenean Mastiffs also need regular nail trims, ear cleanings, and a [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) routine, including at-home tooth brushing and professional dental cleanings.","care-exercise":"Historically, Pyrenean Mastiffs conserved their energy to fight off predators and spent most of their time watching out for their flocks. Because of this, the breed does not require a ton of exercise.\n\nRegular walks or playtime in a fenced backyard are sufficient to keep them healthy and happy.","care-training":"Pyrenean Mastiffs are alert and intelligent. To help them master basic commands, keep training sessions short and upbeat, and use motivational tools such as positive reinforcement and rewards. These dogs love spending time with their owners and will see training as a time to bond.\n\n[Early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) is important, too. Start introducing Pyrenean Mastiffs to new people, pets, and places when they are puppies to help them grow into well-mannered adults.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/pyrenean-mastiff/\n\nhttp://www.fci.be/Nomenclature/Standards/092g02-en.pdf","reviewed-by":"Laura Inman,

Terrier","plural-name":"Irish Terriers","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"Irish Terriers got their start in Cork, Ireland, during the 1870s when the first breed club formed. Their exact origin is unknown, though many experts believe they descended from the Black-and-Tan Irish Terrier. Regardless, the Irish Terrier was the first native Irish breed to be recognized by the English Kennel Club.\n\nDuring World War I, Irish Terriers served as couriers to carry messages to the front. They also received commendations during the war for locating wounded soldiers. F. M. Jowett, an English writer, described them as \"the poor man's sentinel, the farmer's friend, and the gentleman's favorite.\"\n\nBy the 1880s, the Irish Terrier was the fourth most popular breed in England—and that popularity quickly spread to the United States. The American Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1885. And the Irish Terrier Club of America formed in 1896.","facts":"Irish Terriers are charming, loyal, and affectionate dogs that like to please. They're known for their fiery and boisterous personalities and determination as working dogs. At home, Irish Terriers make sensitive family companions.","traits-appearance":"The Irish Terrier is solid in stature, but also agile and elegant. The breed is moderately long in the body with shoulders that slope into its back. Its chest is distinctly deep and muscular.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Irish Terrier has a dense and wiry coat that comes in bright red, golden, red wheaten, or wheaten. A small patch of white is sometimes visible on the dog's chest. Though Irish Terriers are born with black hairs, these lighten to the standard color as the dogs age.","traits-physical":"There's a noticeable uniformity to the Irish Terrier's appearance. It has a long head, strong and muscular jaws, forward-folding ears, and smiling eyes.","temperament":"Irish Terriers are energetic dogs that need consistent challenges for both their mental and physical health. They are full of life but not particularly hyper.\n\nLoyal companions that get along well with people of all ages, Irish Terriers make decent watch dogs. But they may be reserved around strangers.\n\nThis breed can sometimes be reactive to other dogs and may chase wildlife. Other behaviors to watch out for are barking and digging. Because of their working dog backgrounds, Irish Terriers can be hard to distract once they're engaged in an activity.","care-nutrition":"You should feed your Irish Terrier a high-quality dog food that's appropriate for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior) and activity level.\n\nAll dogs run the risk of obesity if they consume too many calories. So, keep an eye on the amount of food you give your Irish Terrier, and reduce the portions if your pup gains weight. Also, remember that giving too many treats in addition to regular meals can contribute to obesity.","care-grooming":"Regular brushing, stripping, and trimming are a must to keep the Irish Terrier's coat looking its best. The dog's outer coat should be hand-stripped rather than clipped, if possible. If done weekly, brushing helps remove dirt and loose hair. And keeping your dog's nails trimmed short will prevent discomfort or issues walking.","care-exercise":"Energetic dogs, Irish Terriers are always up for some fun. They need regular exercise, and romps in a fenced backyard are a great way for them to burn energy. Walking is another good activity, provided they get out several times a day—and always on a leash. These athletic dogs also enjoy field trials, hunting, agility, tracking, and competitive obedience.","care-training":"Although they are incredibly smart dogs, Irish Terriers are strong-willed and have an independent streak. (They are terriers, after all.) These characteristics can make training a challenge. Though this breed enjoys learning and mastering new tasks, reward-based training using toys and treats as motivation will make sessions easier.\n\n[Early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) and basic obedience classes will help Irish Terriers develop into well-mannered adult dogs.

Bleu de Gascogne","plural-name":"Bleus de Gascogne","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The Basset Bleu de Gascogne—or Blue Gascony Basset—comes from southwest France. The breed is a direct descendant of the Grand Bleu de Gascogne and has been around since the 14th century.\n\nSome experts believe the Basset Bleu arose from a crossing between the Grand Bleu and the Saintongeois Basset. Others think the breed resulted from a spontaneous mutation within the Grand Bleu line—combined with selective breeding for shorter-legged dogs.\n\nRegardless of the true origin, the breed was further refined during the French Revolution. Breeders sought to produce a rare combination of hound that was fast enough for horses but also slow enough for hunters on foot. Though the Basset Bleu sports a similar look to its close cousin the Basset Hound, its unique \"blue\" mottled markings and tan points set the breed apart.\n\nThe Basset Bleu neared extinction in the late 19th century, but Alain Bourbon brought the breed back to its current glory. The United Kennel Club recognized the Basset Bleu in 1991.","facts":"The Basset Bleu is a swift, agile hound dog with a keen nose. These dogs can hunt for long periods in all weather—after which they'll happily return home for a long nap on the couch! They love being part of a pack and prefer to spend most of their time with human or canine companions.","traits-appearance":"This breed has a typical Basset appearance: low to the ground and large, but not too heavy.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Basset Bleu de Gascogne has a short, dense, smooth coat. It's predominantly white and ticked with black, giving it a bluish appearance. Generally, black patches on either side of the head cover the ears, surround the eyes, and stop at the cheeks. This breed should always have tan points above the eyes, inside the ears, under the tail, and on the cheeks, lips, and legs.","traits-physical":"The Basset Bleu's key features include a slightly domed skull, droopy lips, long, narrow ears, oval-shaped, sad eyes, a long neck and body, and short, strong legs.","temperament":"These agile, adventurous, and curious dogs love the \"pack life.\" They enjoy the companionship of other dogs and humans alike and make a great addition to the family. Because of their pack mentality, they don't do well when left alone for long periods. If their humans have to be away from home for long stretches of the day, they may do better with a canine buddy to keep them company. Though they're generally affectionate and lively, they can sometimes be reserved—particularly around strangers.\n\nBred for their excellent nose and strong hunting skills, these pups tend to spend a good deal of time with their face to the ground. And once they pick up a scent, it's challenging to keep them from following it. For this reason, it's best to keep your dog in a fenced area when they're off-leash to prevent endless wandering.\n\nBasset Bleus are also known for their musical howls. These can be entertaining to their adoring family members, but close-by neighbors may not have the same appreciation.","care-nutrition":"Basset Bleus need high-quality food appropriate for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). Like all dogs, they're prone to weight gain if they overeat—and that can lead to other health issues. To help them stay at a healthy size, carefully measure out their meals, and limit treats to no more than 10% of their calories.\n\nBecause of the Basset Bleu's deep chest, this breed may be prone to bloat (also known as twisted stomach). To help prevent this life-threatening condition, break your dog's food up into several meals a day, and use a food bowl specially designed to slow their eating. When timing meals, avoid feeding your pup immediately before or after any vigorous activity. Ask your veterinarian about other ways—including surgical options—to prevent bloat.","care-grooming":"The Basset Bleu's short coat doesn't require a lot of grooming. Weekly brushing is usually enough to keep it free of loose hair and dirt.\n\nBecause of their long ears, Basset Bleus may be more prone to ear infections. Check their ears regularly for dirt or wax build-up, and clean them as needed. Nail trims and dental care—including at-home teeth brushing and professional dental cleanings—should also be part of their routine care.","care-exercise":"Basset Bleus are happy to spend much of the day napping on the couch, and they don't typically make great jogging partners. But they still require daily walks and opportunities to get outside and exercise their noses.","care-training":"Like most hounds, Basset Bleus tend to have a stubborn streak. This independent nature can make training a challenge. Patience, a gentle tone, and reward-based methods are the best tools for teaching this breed basic obedience commands.","care-health":null,"references":"http://www.fci.be/Nomenclature/Standards/035g06-en.pdf\n\nhttp://www.vetstreet.com/dogs/basset-bleu-de-gascogne\n","reviewed-by":"Laura Inman,

Sheepdog","plural-name":"Belgian Sheepdogs","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"In Belgium, farmers used sheepdogs to herd cattle. There were eight original sheepdog varieties unique to the country but the number narrowed to four when the dogs were classified in the 1890s. Those breeds—Belgian Malinois, Laekenois, Tervuren, and Groenendael or Chien de Berger Belge—are identical expect for their coat textures, colors, and lengths. The American Kennel Club considers the dog known as the Groenendael to be the Belgian Sheepdog.\n\nDemand for Belgian Sheepdogs spread across the world, as the dogs, known for being bright, watchful, and serious-minded with strong desires to work, have earned their keep in police K9 patrols, border patrols, drug detection, and search and rescue. In both World War I and World War II, Belgian Sheepdogs worked as messengers and ambulance dogs.","facts":"Belgian Sheepdogs are serious and sensitive dogs with a passion for working and companionship. The breed works as hard to earn affection as it does to herd sheep.","traits-appearance":"Belgian Sheepdogs are muscular dogs with alert, attentive expressions and powerful gaits. Males tend to be grand and impressive while females appear more feminine. In both sexes, the topline, front legs, and back legs are in line, giving Belgian Sheepdogs a shape that approximates a square.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Belgian Sheepdog is a double-coated breed with a dense undercoat befitting its climate and a long, straight, and abundant outercoat of medium harshness. The hair is shorter on the head, outside of the ears, and lower parts of the leg; tufts of hair appear on the opening of their ears, providing protection from the elements. Elsewhere on their bodies, Belgian Sheepdogs have long hair around the neck, forming a collarette, and abundant fringe down the backs of their forearms, hindquarters, and tails.\n\nBelgian Sheepdogs have black coats. Their hair might be completely black or black with white—as long as the white is limited to small to moderate patches on their chin, muzzle, forechest, between the pads of their feet, and on the tips of their hind toes. Their coats may turn a reddish shade due to the climate, which is not a disqualification according the breed standard.","traits-physical":"Belgian Sheepdogs are well-balanced with withers just higher than their backs; deep chests; short, broad, strong loins; medium-length pasterns; and round, well-padded feet with the toes curved close together. Their tails are strong at the base and, in action, raised to a curl that is strongest at the tip without forming a hook. These dogs also have medium-sized, almond-shaped, brown eyes and triangular ears.","temperament":"Traits like intelligence, alertness, courage, and attentiveness are among the top reasons Belgian Sheepdogs make excellent working dogs. The breed is also affectionate and devoted to its owners, zealous for their attention. Belgian Sheepdogs do best in homes where they can spend a lot of time with their owners and be included in family activities.\n\nLike all good guard dogs, Belgian Sheepdogs can be vigilant around strangers. These dogs are seldom vicious, but socialization and training can help them become more comfortable with unfamiliar people and overcome their tendencies to be possessive with their owners.","care-nutrition":"Feed Belgian Sheepdogs a high-quality dog food that is appropriate for their life stage (puppy, adult, senior) and consider a diet formulated for active breeds. Portion out their food with a standard measuring cup and limit treats to no more than 10% of their daily calories to avoid overfeeding.","care-grooming":"Although Belgian Sheepdogs have long hair, the breed does not require extensive grooming. Brush their coats at least once per week to remove dead hair and prevent matting. Belgian Sheepdogs shed heavily during semi-annual “shedding seasons” and daily brushing is essential to remove all the dead hair. Baths are only required if Belgian Sheepdogs get into something messy.\n\nClean their ears and trim their nails to prevent cracking, splitting, and painful overgrowths. Regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) that includes at-home teeth brushing and professional cleanings is also an essential part of their grooming routines.","care-exercise":"Like other working dogs, Belgian Sheepdogs require a lot of exercise. These smart, active dogs enjoy activities such as hiking and running as well as dog sports like agility, tracking, herding, and obedience.\n\nBelgian Sheepdogs need human companionship as much as exercise. Rather than telling them to “go play” in a fenced yard, Belgian Sheepdog owners must be prepared to engage with their pets. Play games like hide-and-seek, throw a ball, or race through a DIY agility course in the yard. In addition to high-intensity physical activity, provide mental stimulation, puzzle toys, or other interactive games.\n\nWith too much time alone and too little exercise, the breed can develop behavior problems.","care-training":"Belgian Sheepdogs are intelligent and eager to please, making them a pleasure to train. Skip harsh training methods in favor of positive reinforcement and rewards. In addition to helping Belgian Sheepdogs master basic commands and learn new tricks, consistent training also provides important mental stimulation.

Sapsaree, alternatively spelled Sapsali or Sapsari, originates from Gyeongsan. Along with the [Jindo](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/korean-jindo) and [Donggyeongi](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/donggyeongi), it is one of three native breeds designated as cultural treasures by the Republic of Korea.\n\nDepictions of dogs similar to the Sapsaree appear in tomb murals dating back to 37 B.C.- 668 A.D. Their name means to \"drive away evil spirits and bring blessings.\" Because [Shih Tzu](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/shih-tzu) and [Pekingese](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/pekingese) were sent as gifts to the royal court during the Three Kingdoms period, and were also given the nickname of sapsaree, some suggest the Sapsaree was originally a category of dogs that served a spiritual function. If that is the case, the modern Sapsaree represents that ancient category of dogs as a regional variety that survived. Royal families and aristocrats adored the Sapsaree, and generals used them as military dogs in wars. \n\nHowever, during the Japanese occupation of Korea from 1910 to 1945, the Japanese military killed millions of Sapsarees and used their fur to make coats for their soldiers. In 1969, 30 dogs were found in rural corners of Kyungpook province and a breeding program started. However, due to expense, in the following decades, the breed's population continued to decrease. By the mid-1980s, only eight dogs remained. Geneticist Ha Ji-Hong led the effort to restore the breed, using a combination of traditional breeding and DNA technology, and the breed was designated a natural treasure in 1992 to protect and fund their restoration.\n\nToday, the number of Sapsarees is in the thousands. Some dogs live in homes throughout South Korea, while the Sapsaree Foundation raises others for continued breeding. Because the Sapsaree gene pool is quite small, selection for specific physical traits will not be carried out until there are at least 10,000 breeding dogs to prevent unnecessary inbreeding.","facts":"The Sapsaree is an ancient dog breed from South Korea. They are gentle, obedient dogs with loyal personalities.","traits-appearance":"The Sapsaree is a medium-sized dog with a kind expression. The thick hair on their heads earned them the nickname \"lion dog.\"","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The breed is known for its shaggy double coat. The outer coat is long and thick and can be straight, semi-curly, or curly. The undercoat is short, soft, and dense. Most dogs have furnished faces, but occasionally, smooth-muzzled dogs do occur.\n\nSapsarees come in yellow (hwang) and blue (chung) varieties. Yellow dogs can be any shade of red from cream to mahogany. “Blue” Sapsarees are traditionally called blue due to the color of their fur in moonlight, but are actually black, and black and tan colors are also called blue. Though rare, some dogs are chocolate, white, or spotted.","traits-physical":"The Sapsaree has a rounded head, long muzzle, and long neck. They have a well-developed chest, strong legs, and a long tail that can be straight, curled, or in a ring. They also have large, brown eyes and floppy drop ears.","temperament":"Overall, Sapsarees are charming, loyal dogs that are happiest when close to their people. They are devoted to their families but can be wary of strangers. The breed is typically quiet and only barks when necessary, but when they have something to say, their bark is loud and strong.\n\nThanks to their gentle, obedient nature, Sapsarees make excellent therapy dogs and have been used to soothe hospital patients since 1999.","care-nutrition":"The Sapsaree thrives on high-quality dog food formulated for their age, size, and activity level. \n\nAll dogs are at risk for obesity if they overeat. To help this breed maintain a healthy weight, measure their meals to ensure proper portions and keep treats to 10% or less of their daily calories.","care-grooming":"The Sapsaree's long coat requires daily brushing to prevent tangles and remove loose fur. Their ears should be checked regularly and cleaned when necessary to remove wax build-up and debris. Regular nail trims should also be part of their grooming routine. Nails that grow too long can crack, split, or cause difficulty walking. Finally, establish a [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) routine that includes at-home teeth brushing and professional dental cleanings to support their overall health.","care-exercise":"These dogs are athletic and need daily exercise to stay fit and burn excess energy. Long walks and backyard play sessions are great ways to keep them active. Additionally, Sapsarees love swimming or playing in rivers and lakes. ","care-training":"These intelligent dogs are eager to please their people, so they are typically easy to train. Positive reinforcement using treats or favorite toys as rewards for desired behaviors works well for this breed.\n\nIn addition to obedience training, all dogs will benefit from [early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization). Getting them comfortable with different people and environments when they're young will help them grow into well-adjusted adult

Shepherd","plural-name":"Australian Shepherds","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The Australian Shepherd did not get its start in Australia. The Basques, who lived in the borderlands between France and Spain, relied on Pyrenean Shepherds to work alongside their herds. In the 1800s, the Basques began migrating to Australia to keep sheep. Their Pyrenean Shepherds crossbred with other working dogs, including Collies and Border Collies, creating the modern version of the Australian Shepherd.\n\nThe Basques later immigrated to the United States (with their dogs in tow), and the breed became known as the Australian Shepherd. These fearless herding dogs fast became popular for their skill and stamina. They took their place as an iconic part of “cowboy culture” in the American West and still work on ranches and as rodeo performers.","facts":"The Australian Shepherd is an intelligent, driven working dog with strong herding and guarding instincts. These high-energy, athletic dogs also make loving, affectionate companions for active families.","traits-appearance":"The Australian Shepherd is a medium-sized dog with a solid build, well-balanced proportions, and a smooth, free gait. Males are masculine without coarseness, and females are feminine but not slight of bone.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Australian Shepherds are a double-coated breed with a unique trait: The undercoat varies in quantity with variations in climate. Their outercoats are of medium length and texture, and straight to wavy in appearance. The hair is short and smooth on their heads, ears, front of forelegs, and below the hocks while the backs of the forelegs and britches have moderate feathering. Australian Shepherds have moderate manes and frills that are more pronounced in males.\n\nThe breed comes in several coat colors: black, blue merle, red merle, red (all red or red with or without white markings, and/or tan points). There may be white on the neck, chest, legs, muzzle underparts, and blaze on the head. Australian Shepherds with blue merle or red merle coloring tend to become darker with age.","traits-physical":"Australian Shepherds have solid, muscular bodies with straight, strong backs and deep chests with well-sprung ribs. Their almond-shaped eyes may be brown, blue, amber, or other variations or combinations of these colors—and often include flecks and marbling. Their ears are moderate size, triangular-shaped, and set high on the head. Australian Shepherds have naturally bobbed tails.","temperament":"Although Australian Shepherds are serious about their work, the breed is known for having an even disposition. These are good-natured dogs that are seldom quarrelsome. Their intelligence, exuberance, and playful personalities make Australian Shepherds excellent companions.\n\nAustralian Shepherds are not the right fit for all families. Their strong herding tendencies could lead them to chase cars, corral children, or herd other pets. And despite their friendly natures, it can take time for Aussies to warm up to strangers.\n\nThese dogs do best in homes where there is room to roam and plenty of opportunities to engage in high-energy activities.","care-nutrition":"Feed Australian Shepherds a high-quality dog food that is appropriate for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior) and consider a diet formulated for active breeds. These high-energy dogs are not known for becoming overweight. Still, portioning out their food with a measuring cup and limiting treats to no more than 10% of their daily calories can help keep Australian Shepherds fit and trim.","care-grooming":"Australian Shepherds have waterproof double coats that require regular grooming. Brush them at least once per week to remove cast-off hair and, during spring and fall when these dogs blow their coats, brush them with an undercoat rake several times per week. Regular nail trims and ear cleanings should also be part of the grooming routine.\n\nLike all breeds, Australian Shepherds benefit from regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) that includes at-home teeth-brushing and professional cleanings.","care-exercise":"Australian Shepherds are working dogs that prefer to be on the move. If there are no sheep or cattle to herd, these dogs will require lots of exercise. Aussies make great running companions and enjoy brisk walks, hiking, swimming, and trips to the dog park. These highly intelligent dogs also excel in dog sports such as agility, obedience, rally, dock diving, and—of course—herding.\n\nWithout adequate exercise, Australian Shepherds can become bored and destructive. Mental stimulation is essential, too. Provide Australian Shepherds with puzzle toys to help keep their minds engaged.","care-training":"Training is a must for this breed. Australian Shepherds are intelligent and keen to learn new things, which makes them excellent students. These dogs need guidance to overcome their territorial and overprotective instincts and channel their boundless energy in positive directions. Aussies love spending time with their owners and will see training as a bonding experience.\n\nFocus on positive reinforcement and reward-based training. Avoid repetitive activities, which will cause Australian Shepherds to lose interest in training. Fast-paced games and activities are best to keep them engaged (and help burn off energy).","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/australian-shepherd/\n\nhttp://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/AustralianShepherd.pdf","reviewed-by":"Laura Inman,

the gray wolf. Thousands of years ago, a number of wolves became domesticated. And over time, it became clear that these canines made valuable workers and loyal companions.\n\nAs a result, people began selectively breeding them for certain traits—a practice that led to the hundreds of purebred dogs we know and love today. But the majority of dogs around the world, including Solomon Islands street dogs, do not belong to a particular breed. Instead, they've evolved on their own in their native environment.\n\nExperts believe Austronesian voyagers first brought dogs to the Solomon Islands 3,000 years ago. Genetic testing on modern street dogs from the islands indicates these dogs have a mix of indigenous and European ancestry.\n\nToday, many street dogs roam freely (often in packs) on the islands—where veterinary services are limited and resources for controlling their population are few.","facts":"Solomon Islands street dogs are free-roaming pups that typically congregate in towns or villages with plentiful resources.

That said, common characteristics of street dogs include prick ears and pointed noses.","temperament":"Street dogs must learn to fend for themselves. As a result, they tend to be scrappy, intelligent, and adaptable—all skills that support independent survival. Because they've never had to rely on humans, they may be fearful or skeptical of people who have not earned their trust.","care-nutrition":"A Solomon Islands street dog's diet typically consists of whatever they can kill or find—small farm animals, scraps from trash cans, handouts from kind strangers, and so on. If you're leaving food out for a street dog, they'll benefit from commercial diets formulated for pet dogs.\n\nBecause they fend for themselves, street dogs aren't usually at risk of becoming overweight. However, if you take a street dog under your roof, keep an eye on their food intake to avoid overfeeding. Guidelines on dog food packages are a good starting point when determining daily portions.","care-grooming":"If you've adopted a street dog that's comfortable being handled, regular brushing and nail trims will help them look their best. Good [dental hygiene](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) is also important for any dog.

Solomon Islands street dogs that are on their own will get adequate exercise during their daily roaming. Pet dogs, however, need access to the outdoors to stretch their legs and get mental stimulation. Playing in a fenced yard and going for leashed walks are great ways for your dog to release energy.","care-training":"Street dogs are not accustomed to obeying commands from people.

This includes Namibian street dogs.\n\nToday, many semi-feral and stray dogs in Namibia have either been born in the wild or abandoned by pet owners.

Cocker Spaniel","plural-name":"English Cocker Spaniels","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The English Cocker Spaniel was originally bred in Spain during the 1300s as a hunting and retrieving dog. The dogs then made their way to England, where they hunted on the estates of the wealthy.\n\nEnglish Cocker Spaniels may look somewhat like their [American Cocker Spaniels](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/cocker-spaniel) cousins. But they're actually closer to the working dog form of the Field Spaniel and the Springer Spaniel.\n\nThe American Kennel Club granted the English Cocker Spaniel specific breed designation in 1946.","facts":"The English Cocker Spaniel is a very energetic dog that loves outdoor activities. A highly intelligent breed, English Cocker Spaniels tend to be eager to learn and please. Their happy, playful nature makes them a great family pet.","traits-appearance":"The English Cocker Spaniel has a compact, sturdy, well-balanced body. It's often described by fans of the breed as \"merry\" thanks to its exuberant disposition and bright, happy eyes.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The coat of the English Springer Spaniel is flat with a silky texture. The hair on the top of the head is short and fine, while the hair on the body is medium length. Its forelegs, body, and hind legs above the hocks are well feathered.\n\nThe English Cocker Spaniel comes in a range of solid and parti-colors with white. The colors are black, liver, or shades of red, including lemon and orange. Some dogs have a white chest blaze, and tan points are possible. Ticking is also frequently seen.","traits-physical":"An English Cocker Spaniel's ears are set low and lie close to the head. The ear leather (i.e., ear lobe) is fine and extends to the nose. Long, silky, straight, or slightly wavy hair keeps the ears well covered.\n\nTheir eyes—medium-sized, slightly oval, and set wide apart—are a key feature of their soft, melting expression. Contributing to their prowess as hunters, they have wide nostrils that allow for proper development of scenting ability. And their strong jaws are capable of carrying a bird as large as a duck or pheasant.","temperament":"English Cocker Spaniels are a good breed for families. Happy by nature, they love human company and are friendly toward children.\n\nSome English Cocker Spaniels can have a high amount of energy. But with proper exercise, most can live happily in cities, suburbs, rural areas—making them a very adaptable family pet. They are also generally outgoing toward strangers and do well with pets and other dogs.\n\nHunters by nature, English Cocker Spaniels may chase wildlife. For this reason, it's best to keep them in a fenced yard or on a leash when outside.","care-nutrition":"To meet their nutritional needs, you should feed English Cocker Spaniels a high-quality diet that's appropriate for their current life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). A food formulated specifically for medium-sized dogs is a good option to consider.\n\nEnglish Cocker Spaniels are prone to becoming overweight. Their daily food intake—including treats—must be carefully monitored to help prevent weight gain. Generally speaking, treats should make up no more than 10% of their calories for the day.","care-grooming":"To prevent mats and tangles, brush an English Cocker Spaniel's coat at least once a week, if not more. Regular trimming also helps keep their coats looking neat and tidy.\n\nAn English Cocker Spaniel's long ears can make them more susceptible to ear infections. So, routinely check and clean their ears to prevent infections from developing.\n\nAs with most dogs, overgrown nails in English Cocker Spaniels can lead to pain, splitting, or even problems running or walking. Their nails need regular inspection and trimming to prevent these potential problems.\n\n[Dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) is an essential part of any dog's long-term health. In addition to professional cleanings, an at-home dental care routine—including regular teeth-brushing and dental treats or toys—should be established.","care-exercise":"English Cocker Spaniels need plenty of physical activity to thrive. Backyard games of fetch, long walks, and hikes are fun ways for them to burn off energy. They also seem to enjoy dog sports such as hunting, tracking, retrieving, agility, rally, and competitive obedience.","care-training":"Positive reinforcement and a gentle tone are the best way to train this eager to please, obedient breed. English Cocker Spaniels are very food-motivated, which can be helpful during training sessions. Treats can help you manage guarding tendencies and can serve as rewards for giving up inappropriate objects they've retrieved.\n\nSometimes, English Cocker Spaniels demonstrate fearful behaviors; reward-based training can help to minimize them. Additionally, [early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) will help them develop into well-mannered adult dogs.","care-health":null,"references":"http://www.fci.be/Nomenclature/Standards/005g08-en.pdf\n\nhttp://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/EnglishCockerSpaniel.pdf\n\nhttps://www.akc.org/expert-advice/lifestyle/cocker-spaniel-vs-english-cocker-spaniel/\n\nhttps://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/english-cocker-spaniel/\n\nhttps://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/dog-breeds/english-cocker-spaniel\n\nhttps://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/english-cocker-spaniel#/slide/1","reviewed-by":"Annette Louviere, DVM","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":10.4,"weight-range-pet-max":18.6,"weight-range-show-min":11.8,"weight-range-show-max":14.5,"height-range-min":38.0,"height-range-max":41.0,"life-span-range-min":12.0,"life-span-range-max":14.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":96,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":59,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":40},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/6e9410a7-00f3-59f1-a1f2-93efacd6fe6b/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/6e9410a7-00f3-59f1-a1f2-93efacd6fe6b/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/6e9410a7-00f3-59f1-a1f2-93efacd6fe6b/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/6e9410a7-00f3-59f1-a1f2-93efacd6fe6b/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/6e9410a7-00f3-59f1-a1f2-93efacd6fe6b/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/6e9410a7-00f3-59f1-a1f2-93efacd6fe6b/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/6e9410a7-00f3-59f1-a1f2-93efacd6fe6b/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/6e9410a7-00f3-59f1-a1f2-93efacd6fe6b/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/6e9410a7-00f3-59f1-a1f2-93efacd6fe6b/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/6e9410a7-00f3-59f1-a1f2-93efacd6fe6b/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/6e9410a7-00f3-59f1-a1f2-93efacd6fe6b/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/6e9410a7-00f3-59f1-a1f2-93efacd6fe6b/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/6e9410a7-00f3-59f1-a1f2-93efacd6fe6b/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/6e9410a7-00f3-59f1-a1f2-93efacd6fe6b/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/6e9410a7-00f3-59f1-a1f2-93efacd6fe6b/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/6e9410a7-00f3-59f1-a1f2-93efacd6fe6b/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/6e9410a7-00f3-59f1-a1f2-93efacd6fe6b/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/6e9410a7-00f3-59f1-a1f2-93efacd6fe6b/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"6f3729e2-2abb-5b17-9442-7d6c4b5ce62d","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/6f3729e2-2abb-5b17-9442-7d6c4b5ce62d"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"street-dog-ghana","name":"Ghanaian Street Dog","plural-name":"Ghanaian Street Dogs","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"Like all dogs, the Ghanaian street dog descends from the gray wolf. At some point, a number of wolves became domesticated (but experts disagree on exactly when and how). And over time, it became clear that these domesticated canines could perform many useful jobs—from pulling sleds to herding sheep to protecting livestock.\n\nAs a result, people began selectively breeding them to strengthen the traits that made them excel in specific areas or conditions. This effort resulted in the many purebred dogs that we know and love today. But the majority of dogs around the world do not belong to a particular breed. This includes Ghanaian street dogs.\n\nSometimes referred to as Avuvi, Ghanaian street dogs are indigenous dogs from the west-African \"Dahomey Gap\" region. People don't often keep them as pets, but some use them as guard or hunting dogs. Even when used for such functional purposes, Ghanaian street dogs are typically free-roaming and fend for themselves. They hunt for food using a combination of sight and scent and are skilled at catching rats and birds.","facts":"Ghanaian street dogs are free-roaming dogs that typically congregate in cities or large towns where resources are plentiful. Though they're domesticated and share many basic traits with pet dogs, they lead primarily independent lives outdoors.","traits-appearance":"Ghanaian street dogs are muscular, medium-sized dogs. Their bodies are slightly longer than their legs.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Most Ghanaian street dogs have short, fine coats. However, variation does occur, and some dogs have thicker, longer coats or curly hair with fringed tails. Possible coat colors include deep mahogany with or without a black overlay, black, black and white, tricolor, brindle, or cream. Some of these street dogs have white on the feet and the tip of the tail.","traits-physical":"Ghanaian street dogs have hazel to dark brown eyes and small ears that can be either erect or floppy. They also have strong necks and balanced, slender bodies. The breed's medium-length, low-set tail bends back to lightly touch the spine.","temperament":"Energetic and intelligent, Ghanaian street dogs are natural hunters. As such, they'll dig for and pursue small animals. To prevent this, always keep your dog on a leash or in an enclosed area—where they won't be tempted to give chase—when outside.\n\nThese pups communicate using a set of unique, wide-ranging sounds. And they're wary of strangers and not shy about barking or defending their territory. So, they make excellent guard dogs.","care-nutrition":"Free-roaming Ghanaian street dogs' diets typically consist of whatever they can kill or find—small farm animals, scraps from trash cans, handouts from kind strangers, and so on. If you're leaving food out for a street dog, they'll benefit from commercial diets formulated for pet dogs.\n\nBecause they fend for themselves, street dogs aren't usually at risk of becoming overweight. However, if you take a street dog under your roof, keep an eye on their food intake to avoid overfeeding. Guidelines on dog food packages are a good starting point when determining daily portions.","care-grooming":"If you've adopted a street dog that's comfortable being handled, regular brushing and nail trims will help them look their best. Good [dental hygiene](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) is also important for any dog.

Several characteristics—including its soft mouth and long, protective coat—helped it excel as a hunting companion.\n\nThough the first breed standard was created in 1894, the Barbet was mentioned in historical texts from the 16th century. Experts believe the Barbet was the progenitor of several other breeds, including the Bichon, Briard, Newfoundland, and Poodle.\n\nDespite the popularity of the breed in its early years, the Barbet nearly became extinct during the World Wars. And some say that the modern-day Barbet is merely a re-creation of the breed. Interest in the breed picked up in the late 1900s, and a Barbet breed club formed in France in 1980.\n\nThe Barbet first came to the U.S. in 1994. And it earned full AKC recognition on January 1, 2020. The breed population is still relatively small, with an estimated 500 dogs in the U.S. Because of their long, curly hair, this rare breed is often mistaken for the more commonly seen Goldendoodle or Labradoodle.","facts":"Intelligent and obedient, the Barbet makes an excellent companion and family pet. Nicknamed “Mud Dog,” they enjoy playing in muddy, swampy areas. Owners of this breed have described them as quirky, goofy, clownish, and loving.","traits-appearance":"The Barbet is a rustic, medium-sized breed of balanced proportions. They are known for their long, curly hair and distinct beard.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Barbet has a thick, woolly coat that provides protection against cold and damp conditions. Its natural curls range from large and loose to tight and small.\n\nThe breed comes in a variety of colors, including all shades of black, gray, brown, and fawn. White spotting is acceptable, but not required by the breed standard.","traits-physical":"Barbets have strong, broad heads that are proportionately large. In addition to the long, curly hair that covers their bodies, they have profuse beards and a mustache that entirely covers the bridge of the nose.\n\nThe Barbet’s ears are wide and are set at eye level. They reach at least to the corner of the mouth and are also covered with the trademark long hair.","temperament":"Barbets make excellent companions and family pets. These loyal dogs become very attached to their owners and are good with children.\n\nAs intelligent, obedient dogs that love to learn, Barbets may become bored without stimulation. Fortunately, this breed enjoys all kinds of activities. And when adequately exercised, Barbets can even make good apartment dogs.\n\nWith [proper socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization), Barbets tend to get along well with other dogs and even cats. However, true to their sporting breed ways, they may be predisposed to chase small animals.","care-nutrition":"Barbets need a high-quality diet appropriate for their specific life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). They don’t typically have big appetites. During drier summer months, they may benefit from having oil added to their diets. A consultation with a veterinarian is the best way to ensure nutritional needs are met.\n\nEven though Barbets don’t tend to overeat, it’s still important to monitor food intake, as any dog can be at risk for obesity. To avoid accidental overfeeding, portion out their food using a standard measuring cup. And remember to account for treats when considering their daily calories—they should make up no more than 10% of a dog’s daily calories.","care-grooming":"The Barbet’s shagginess is part of the breed’s signature look. To maintain the health of their curly coats, Barbets need frequent brushing and regular baths. Blow-drying their hair after a bath will straighten it out, making it easier to perform a full-body trim with scissors.\n\nBarbets have strong, fast-growing nails that you should trim regularly. Overgrown nails can lead to pain or even problems running or walking.\n\nAs with all dogs, Barbets require regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care), including at-home teeth brushing and professional dental cleanings. Maintaining good dental hygiene is vital for their overall long-term health, and the sooner you get them into a good dental care routine, the better.","care-exercise":"Barbets are often content to lounge on the couch with their people, but only if they get plenty of exercise beforehand. They love swimming, backyard play sessions, and chasing tennis balls. They also enjoy activities such as conformation, agility, dock diving, and disc dog.\n\nBarbets can get overheated. For this reason, they don’t make good long-distance running companions. With their long coats, they’re much better equipped to handle the cold temperatures of winter.","care-training":"Barbets respond best to positive reinforcement and an upbeat training environment. They are an obedient breed that benefits from [a consistent training

They're very popular on Gran Canaria and Tenerife but rarely found anywhere else.\n\nTechnically a sighthound breed, the Podenco Canario is similar to other Mediterranean breeds—including the Pharaoh Hound and Ibizan Hound. Though it's impossible to confirm, some experts believe the breed descended from ancient Egyptian dogs and came to the island alongside Phoenician traders in Roman times.\n\nOver the years, Podenco Canarios evolved to hunt on rocky volcanic terrain—developing unusually shaped, cat-like feet. They're also highly skilled at detecting rabbits, and when they do, they sound a short and repetitive bark known as their \"rabbit song.\"\n\nThe United Kennel Club recognized the Podenco Canario in 2006.","facts":"Podencos Canarios are excitable, hard-working, and alert dogs. With a high level of energy and endurance, they make enthusiastic hunting companions and loyal family pets.","traits-appearance":"The Podenco Canario is a medium-sized dog with a slender frame and lean, well-developed muscles.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The breed has a short, dense, and smooth coat. It can be any combination of white and red, with the red ranging in intensity from orange to dark mahogany.","traits-physical":"Podencos Canarios have long, cone-shaped heads, flesh-colored noses, almond-shaped, dark amber eyes, large, prick ears, and low-set tails that reach just below the hock and taper at the tip.","temperament":"Podencos Canarios are active, intelligent, and sensitive dogs. They get very attached to their families and are usually gentle with kids.\n\nThough often reserved with people they don't know, these dogs typically aren't aggressive. But they do have a high prey drive and may chase cats, other small pets, or wildlife. Early socialization can help curb this behavior.","care-nutrition":"Podencos Canarios thrive on a diet formulated for their size and life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). To help them stay at a healthy weight, portion out their meals with a measuring cup to prevent over-feeding, and limit treats to no more than 10% of their daily calories.","care-grooming":"This breed's short, smooth coat doesn't require much maintenance. Occasional brushing should keep it looking clean and shiny. Trimming nails, cleaning ears, and brushing teeth should also be part of every dog's grooming routine, regardless of breed.","care-exercise":"Podencos Canarios are active dogs that need plenty of daily exercise. Long, brisk walks and opportunities to run and chase in a fenced yard will help them burn their endless energy. They also seem to enjoy participating in dog sports—such as lure coursing, racing, agility, and competitive obedience.","care-training":"Though smart, Podencos Canarios can be stubborn and independent. Start obedience training at a young age and use a firm and consistent—but positive and reward-focused—approach. These pups don't respond well to punishment or harsh treatment.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.ukcdogs.com/podenco-canario\n\nhttp://www.fci.be/Nomenclature/Standards/329g05-en.pdf\n\nhttps://www.petguide.com/breeds/dog/podenco-canario\n","reviewed-by":"Jamie

Xoloitzcuintli is a breed from Mexico, dating back more than 3,000 years. The unique name comes from the Aztec god Xolotl and the Aztec name for dog, \"Itzcuintli.\" Aztecs believed Xolos had magical powers, ranging from healing the sick to warding off evil spirits.\n\nHave you ever heard the saying, \"three dog night?\" That's a reference to the Native American practice of sleeping among Xolos to keep warm. Due to their lack of an insulating hair coat, Xolos feel noticeably warm to the touch. So, people slept with one (or several) Xolos depending on the harshness of the weather.\n\nDespite the existence of a short-coated variety, Xoloitzcuintlis are also called Mexican Hairless Dogs. Though one of the first breeds ever recognized by the American Kennel Club, Mexican Hairless Dogs lost popularity in the late 1950s. As a result, the AKC removed the breed's listing.\n\nFortunately, Xolos have since regained their popularity and recovered their AKC status in 2011. Xoloitzcuintlis are now growing in numbers, but they're still considered a rare breed.","facts":"The Xoloitzcuintli (pronounced \"show-low-eats-queent-lee\") is one of the world's oldest breeds. These intelligent, alert, and loyal dogs make fine family pets. And don't worry—they have a nickname that's much easier to pronounce: Xolo (show-low).","traits-appearance":"The athletic Xoloitzcuintli has a blunt, wedge-shaped head and tapering muzzle. It also has a noticeable underjaw. Xolos come in three sizes: Toy, Miniature, and Standard.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Xolos come in coated and hairless varieties, the hairless being most popular. Hairless Xolos have smooth, tough skin and short, coarse hair on their heads, feet, and tips of their tails. Coated Xolos have short, flat hair covering their bodies. The breed has many color variants—including black, gray, liver, bronze, and red—all seen with or without spotting.","traits-physical":"On the hairless Xolo, a lack of hair is the breed's distinguishing feature. But both varieties of Xolo have intelligent and thoughtful facial expressions.","temperament":"Calm and affectionate, the Xoloitzcuintli is a social breed that enjoys being part of family activities.\n\nBoth alert and territorial, the Xolo is often protective of its people. This breed may also seem aloof with strangers, making it an excellent guard or watchdog.\n\nGiven its preference to stay close to home, there is little risk that a Xolo will run away.","care-nutrition":"The Xoloitzcuintli needs high-quality, age-appropriate dog food. All dogs run the risk of obesity if they eat too many calories. So, keep an eye on how much your Xolo eats and reduce portions if your pup gains weight. Also, remember that giving too many treats in addition to regular meals can lead to weight gain.","care-grooming":"Hairless Xoloitzcuintlis generally requires minimal grooming as adults. They can, however, get acne as adolescents. So, their skin may need special care at that age. The Hairless Xolo also needs sunscreen to protect its exposed skin when outdoors.\n\nThe coated variety of the Xolo is easy to care for. An ideal grooming routine includes a weekly brushing, regular nail trims, and the occasional bath.","care-exercise":"Adult Xolos are typically calm—satisfied with long walks or playtime in the yard for exercise. However, Xoloitzcuintli puppies need considerably more activity to thrive.","care-training":"The Xolo is an intelligent breed and easy to train, provided you follow a consistent regimen and define boundaries. Xoloitzcuintlis need a strong owner to act as the pack leader.\n\nAlso, [early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) and puppy training classes are a must for all dogs, including the Xolo.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Xoloitzcuintli/nO0KBgAAQBAJ\n\nhttps://www.google.com/books/edition/Xoloitzcuintli/r51xAgAAQBAJ\n\nhttps://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/xoloitzcuintli/","reviewed-by":"Annette

Basenji is among the oldest dog breeds. Cave paintings in Libya dating back to early 6000 B.C. depict dogs that look remarkably similar to it. And relics from 3000 B.C. prove Egyptians kept Basenjis as companion dogs. The Pygmies—one of the oldest cultures in Africa—likely also had Basenjis in what we now call the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\nExcellent hunters comfortable working on their own, these capable dogs have provided food for their people for years. Experts believe the early Basenji migrated from Africa to Europe around 1880. Called \"Congo Terriers,\" these dogs were similar to the Basenji of today. But they did have a few unique characteristics.\n\nIn 1936, a woman named Olivia Burns brought Basenjis to England to begin a proper breeding program. War interrupted the program for several years. But another woman named Veronica Tudor-Williams kept the breeding efforts in England alive. And by 1941, people were importing Basenji dogs directly from Africa to the United States.","facts":"Basenjis are independent, intelligent, and interesting dogs. Their stubborn natures have earned them a reputation of being difficult to train. But with a little positivity and patience, the Basenji makes a charming and delightful companion.","traits-appearance":"This small, short-haired breed has a wrinkled head, tall, pointed ears, and a tightly curled tail. Smooth and poised with dark hazel, almond-shaped eyes, Basenjis always appear ready for adventure.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Basenji's short, fine coat is easy to care for. These dogs can be chestnut red, pure black, black and tan, or brindle. And they may have white on their feet, chest, tail tip, legs, blaze, and collar.","traits-physical":"Elegant and muscular, Basenjis move with a swift trot and a smooth, effortless stride.","temperament":"Though friendly with their people, Basenjis are independent and aloof dogs. They may be wary of strangers and young, boisterous children. Basenjis are considered \"barkless,\" but they sometimes howl or \"scream\" when they get lonely. Most Basenji fans fall in love with these dogs' yodeling—which they typically do when they're happy.\n\nThe Basenji is an active breed whose stubbornness can create training challenges. These dogs also get bored easily, and they tend to get into mischief. But when properly trained and socialized, the Basenji is a pleasant dog that can provide endless entertainment.","care-nutrition":"Basenjis thrive on a high-quality diet suited to their particular age and any health concerns. Some dogs may gain excess weight as they age, so it's important to monitor how much your Basenji eats and reduce portions as necessary. Your veterinarian should be able to help provide appropriate nutrition and feeding guidelines.","care-grooming":"The Basenji's short, low-maintenance coat usually requires just a weekly combing with a soft-bristle brush or grooming mitt. And you'll likely find your Basenji likes to take charge of their own cleaning, as well.\n\nTrimming nails, cleaning ears, and [brushing teeth](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) should also be part of every dog's grooming routine, regardless of breed.","care-exercise":"An alert and energetic breed, the Basenji requires a lot of daily exercise to be healthy and well-behaved. These dogs will play for hours in a well-fenced yard. And they are excellent candidates for dog sports—such as lure coursing and agility. Whatever activities your Basenji partakes in, be sure to always keep them in a secure area or on a leash when they are outside.","care-training":"Basenjis have earned a reputation for being hard to train—in large part due to their independent personalities and stubborn tendencies. But with positive, reward-based techniques, you can train a Basenji. Just be sure to keep sessions short to keep your dog engaged.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.basenji.org/BasenjiU/Owner/Handbook/HandPDF/UnderstandingOG.pdf\n\nhttp://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/Basenji.pdf\n\nhttps://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/basenji/","reviewed-by":"Cindy Elston, DVM, MPH","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":7.3,"weight-range-pet-max":15.4,"weight-range-show-min":7.7,"weight-range-show-max":12.7,"height-range-min":38.0,"height-range-max":43.0,"life-span-range-min":12.0,"life-span-range-max":14.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":98,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":58,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":40},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/722040c4-5b26-57cd-82e2-4cb99928098f/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/722040c4-5b26-57cd-82e2-4cb99928098f/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/722040c4-5b26-57cd-82e2-4cb99928098f/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/722040c4-5b26-57cd-82e2-4cb99928098f/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/722040c4-5b26-57cd-82e2-4cb99928098f/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/722040c4-5b26-57cd-82e2-4cb99928098f/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/722040c4-5b26-57cd-82e2-4cb99928098f/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/722040c4-5b26-57cd-82e2-4cb99928098f/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/722040c4-5b26-57cd-82e2-4cb99928098f/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/722040c4-5b26-57cd-82e2-4cb99928098f/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/722040c4-5b26-57cd-82e2-4cb99928098f/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/722040c4-5b26-57cd-82e2-4cb99928098f/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/722040c4-5b26-57cd-82e2-4cb99928098f/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/722040c4-5b26-57cd-82e2-4cb99928098f/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/722040c4-5b26-57cd-82e2-4cb99928098f/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/722040c4-5b26-57cd-82e2-4cb99928098f/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/722040c4-5b26-57cd-82e2-4cb99928098f/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/722040c4-5b26-57cd-82e2-4cb99928098f/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"724828c7-6d1b-5f72-a194-1ecf59650972","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/724828c7-6d1b-5f72-a194-1ecf59650972"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"skye-terrier","name":"Skye Terrier","plural-name":"Skye Terriers","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The Skye Terrier has been around for more than four centuries—making it one of the oldest terrier breeds. Likely originating on the Isle of Skye, this breed existed only in northwestern Scotland for many years. The Skye Terrier was often used for hunting otter and fox. These petite dogs could squeeze into small spaces to flush out prey.\n\nIn 1840, Queen Victoria began breeding both the drop-eared and prick-eared varieties in her royal kennels. This caused the breed to gain popularity, especially among the nobility. In 1887, the American Kennel Club recognized the Skye Terrier, which quickly became a favorite at dog shows.","facts":"An intelligent, sensitive, and calm breed, the Skye Terrier has lots of character. These playful dogs tend to be very affectionate toward family and love exploring the outdoors. That said, they don't require much exercise and will happily relax at home with their people.","traits-appearance":"Skye Terriers are agile, sturdy, muscular little dogs with long coats that cascade down their bodies.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Skye Terrier's long double-coat may be shades of black, silver, gray, fawn, or cream. The back and tips of the dog's ears may be black or a darker shade. A small white chest blaze is possible in this breed.","traits-physical":"The Skye Terrier is known for its abundant coat that completely covers its long, low body.","temperament":"Skye Terriers are alert, intelligent, and fearlessly independent. Because of their hunting background, they may bark, dig, or chase wildlife. They can also be difficult to disengage from an activity.\n\nSkye Terriers are sometimes reserved around strangers and may not get along with other dogs. And they often require careful training and [socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) to prevent them from developing small dog syndrome (when little dogs become overly dominant). Otherwise, they might constantly bark, nip at strangers, or challenge your authority.\n\nThat said, these dogs make wonderful family pets with a little work.","care-nutrition":"Skye Terriers need a high-quality, age-appropriate diet—whether it's commercially manufactured or homemade (under a veterinarian's supervision and approval).\n\nTo prevent weight-related health problems, monitor how much your Skye Terrier eats, and reduce portions if necessary. Also, remember that giving too many treats can contribute to obesity.","care-grooming":"The flowing double-coat of the Skye Terrier may look like it would be hard to manage. But a weekly brushing and combing is all that's required to keep your pup looking good.\n\nMonthly baths, nail trims, and ear cleanings are also integral to a comprehensive grooming routine. And all dogs need regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care), which should include teeth brushing.","care-exercise":"Skye Terriers don't need much exercise. A short daily stroll is typically sufficient to keep them healthy. That said, this breed also seems to enjoy dog sports—such as earthdog trials, agility, and tracking.","care-training":"A sensitive but strong-willed breed, the Skye Terrier doesn't respond well to harsh discipline. But consistent positive reinforcement and a gentle tone will help this dog become the faithful and loving pet it can be.\n\nSkye Terriers have a strong prey drive and will chase squirrels and other little critters if you let them. Basic obedience training can help curb this desire. And [early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) will help your pup grow up to be a well-mannered companion.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Skye_Terrier/9toKBgAAQBAJ\n\nhttps://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/skye-terrier/","reviewed-by":"Annette Louviere,

Terrier","plural-name":"Russell Terriers","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"Russell Terriers are also commonly referred to as Jack Russell Terriers. They're named after Reverend John Russell, who developed the breed to hunt fox during the 1800s. These small-bodied dogs helped drive foxes from their lairs, giving the hunters easy access.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, many children learned about the breed from Wishbone—a children's show centered around an inspirational Russell Terrier. A clever and adventurous pup, Wishbone dreamt about playing the lead character in stories of classic literature.","facts":"The Russell Terrier is a cheerful little breed that packs plenty of spunk and personality into its pocket-sized body. These intelligent, cute, and charming dogs are feisty, fearless, and fun to be around.","traits-appearance":"The Russell Terrier is a strong and agile working dog that sports a medium-sized flexible body. Its effortless movements complement a lively, intelligent expression.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Russell Terriers can have three coat types: smooth, rough, or broken. The three types are all predominantly white with tan, black, or brown markings.","traits-physical":"Dark, almond-shaped eyes, V-shaped ears, and a bright expression set the Russell Terrier apart from other breeds.","temperament":"Performers at heart, Russell Terriers can become skilled at tricks and love entertaining people. But they may be undistractable once engaged in an activity they enjoy.\n\nDespite their reputation for being good family dogs, Russell Terriers can develop small dog syndrome (when little dogs think they're the boss). Without proper training, they might constantly bark, nip at strangers, or challenge their owners. Firm and consistent correction should nip this problem in the bud.\n\nOverall, Russell Terriers make wonderful family pets and do well with children—provided the young ones know how to behave around dogs.","care-nutrition":"Russell Terriers need to eat high-quality dog food that's appropriate for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). To keep them at a healthy weight, monitor food portions carefully. And be sure to take treats into account when tracking their daily calorie intake. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of a dog's calories.","care-grooming":"The Russell Terrier's spirited look requires little maintenance. You can keep the smooth coat in top form with a weekly spruce-up using a hound glove or soft brush. Similarly, a weekly brush or comb for dogs with rough or broken coats will ensure they look their finest.\n\nMonthly nail trimming is also important, along with a weekly check of your dog's ears for wax buildup or accumulated debris.","care-exercise":"Russell Terriers aren't the best dogs for inactive lifestyles. These peppy pooches enjoy getting out and moving with the family. Think hiking, biking, walking, and playing games.\n\nThe breed requires plenty of energetic pursuits that will exercise both its body and mind. Russell Terriers seem to have an almost boundless supply of get-up-and-go. As such, they enjoy fetching, agility, flyball, and more.","care-training":"Russell Terriers have a strong prey drive, so they should always be on a leash when out and about. This will help control your dog's urge to bolt and chase the neighbor's cat, a small animal, or another dog. [Early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) can also help curb any problems that might arise from this impulse.\n\nBecause the Russell Terrier is an extremely intelligent breed, boredom can easily set in if training sessions are not engaging. So, keep it interesting!","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Giant_Book_of_Dog_Names/K1G7cqB-o9wC\n\nhttp://www.fci.be/Nomenclature/Standards/345g03-en.pdf\n\nhttps://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/russell-terrier/","reviewed-by":"Laura Inman, DVM","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":5.4,"weight-range-pet-max":10.9,"weight-range-show-min":6.4,"weight-range-show-max":8.2,"height-range-min":25.0,"height-range-max":38.0,"life-span-range-min":12.0,"life-span-range-max":16.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":90,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":56,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":42},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/73a9f88d-5f67-5305-9bb8-0cd1eb359541/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/73a9f88d-5f67-5305-9bb8-0cd1eb359541/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/73a9f88d-5f67-5305-9bb8-0cd1eb359541/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/73a9f88d-5f67-5305-9bb8-0cd1eb359541/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/73a9f88d-5f67-5305-9bb8-0cd1eb359541/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/73a9f88d-5f67-5305-9bb8-0cd1eb359541/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/73a9f88d-5f67-5305-9bb8-0cd1eb359541/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/73a9f88d-5f67-5305-9bb8-0cd1eb359541/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/73a9f88d-5f67-5305-9bb8-0cd1eb359541/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/73a9f88d-5f67-5305-9bb8-0cd1eb359541/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/73a9f88d-5f67-5305-9bb8-0cd1eb359541/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/73a9f88d-5f67-5305-9bb8-0cd1eb359541/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/73a9f88d-5f67-5305-9bb8-0cd1eb359541/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/73a9f88d-5f67-5305-9bb8-0cd1eb359541/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/73a9f88d-5f67-5305-9bb8-0cd1eb359541/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/73a9f88d-5f67-5305-9bb8-0cd1eb359541/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/73a9f88d-5f67-5305-9bb8-0cd1eb359541/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/73a9f88d-5f67-5305-9bb8-0cd1eb359541/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"73ebeb64-7c0e-52b1-b7e9-f48e451276f7","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/73ebeb64-7c0e-52b1-b7e9-f48e451276f7"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"lancashire-heeler","name":"Lancashire Heeler","plural-name":"Lancashire Heelers","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"As the name would suggest, the Lancashire Heeler (also known as the Ormskirk Heeler) originated in Lancashire, Northern England. Experts believe the early breed was a cross of Welsh Corgis—which were escorting herds to local markets—and the indigenous Manchester Terriers.\n\nLancashire Heelers have historically been used to round up cattle and sheep on farms by sharply nipping the herd's heels. They also served as expert ratters and rabbit hunters.\n\nThis short, black-and-tan-coated breed is uncommon outside of Northern England and rarely found outside of the United Kingdom—where it attained formal recognition by the Kennel Club in 1981. The American Kennel Club first listed the Lancashire Heeler on the Foundation Stock Service breed register in 1999.\n\nThough their numbers are relatively low, Lancashire Heelers' cute appearance and energetic work ethic may make them superstars in the dog world yet.","facts":"Alert and intelligent, Lancashire Heelers make excellent—albeit small—herding dogs. At home, they're happy-go-lucky, chatty, affectionate, and always up for a walk.","traits-appearance":"Good things come in small packages. The Lancashire Heeler is a strong and observant little worker bee that moves neatly and quickly.\n\nSturdy, short-legged dogs, Lancashire Heelers are a little longer than they are tall. They carry their tails skyward with a bit of a curl. Their wide, flat heads taper a bit, and their almond-shaped eyes are set wide apart.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Lancashire Heeler’s dense double coat is either black and tan or liver and tan. A small, white chest blaze is also possible in this breed.","traits-physical":"Lancashire Heelers have a unique characteristic that says, \"I'm friendly and in a good mood.\" It's called the Heeler Smile: The dogs draw back their lips and actual smirk.","temperament":"Loyal, courageous, and happy, the Lancashire Heeler is friendly and affectionate toward its family. However, it can be a rather watchful and cautious breed—making it an outstanding herding dog.\n\nSome Lancashire Heelers may be wary of strangers and tend to bark a lot. They generally get along with children, but—like all dogs—should be closely supervised for the safety of everyone involved.","care-nutrition":"Lancashire Heelers require a high-quality diet that is age-appropriate. Also, it's important to keep an eye on the amount of food your pup eats and reduce the portions if they gain weight. Remember that giving too many treats in addition to regular meals can contribute to obesity.","care-grooming":"Besides a light brushing or occasional bath, this breed requires very little grooming. However, Lancashire Heelers do need their nails trimmed to keep overgrowth, splitting, and cracking at bay.\n\nYou should also check your dog's ears often to avoid wax buildup and the accumulation of debris. Regular teeth-brushing should become a habit, as well.","care-exercise":"Lancashire Heelers like plenty of exercise, interaction with people, and brain games to keep busy. Outdoor playtime excites them, but you should limit it to fenced-in yards or dog parks, as these dogs are known to be escape artists. Of course, a few on-leash walks throughout the day are great options, too.\n\nWhen indoors, Lancashire Heelers like to hide and be found, chase balls, and learn tricks. They also really dig dog sports—particularly earthdog trials.","care-training":"Quick to learn, the Lancashire Heeler responds well to reward-based training techniques with yummy treats and toys. This breed can be independent, though.

Mountains of Eastern Europe. Traditionally, Caucasian Shepherd Dogs guarded herds and protected the home.\n\nExperts believe that this breed is a close relative of Asian mastiffs and sheepdogs of the Balkans. Historical accounts from the first century BC show that large dogs—resembling the Caucasian Shepherd Dog—worked as part of the Armenian Tsar's army.\n\nIn the 1920s, Caucasian Shepherd Dog breeding took off in earnest in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). There, Caucasian Shepherd Dogs became common thanks to their fearlessness and imposing physical appearance, as well as their excellent sight and hearing.\n\nHowever, they didn't make their first appearance in Western Europe until the 1930s. The Caucasian Shepherd Dog became part of the American Kennel Club's Foundation Stock Service in 1996.","facts":"The fearless and intimidating Caucasian Shepherd Dog is loyal and loving to its family. It's a guardian dog at heart and can be fierce and, at times, aggressive when they feel a threat is present. Because of their large size, they need supervision around small kids; they're also better suited to larger areas where they can roam and explore.","traits-appearance":"This massive dog has a muscular build with a large head, oval eyes, and triangular ears. The Caucasian Shepherd Dog’s high-set tail is either sickle-curve or curled. And the breed has a straight, coarse, double coat that can be any length.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Caucasian Shepherd Dog has a double coat that is dense and thick and can be any length. The breed can be any color (except for solid black), piebald, or spotted.","traits-physical":"The Caucasian Shepherd Dog's massive size is its most distinctive trait, with the dogs weighing more than 110 pounds for males and 100 pounds for the females. Despite such a large size, this breed is agile and free on its feet, with good stability and coordination.","temperament":"This fearless breed requires proper training and [socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) because they're highly territorial and protective, and can be wary of strangers. They make excellent guard dogs and are devoted and loyal to their people.","care-nutrition":"The Caucasian Shepherd is an extra-large breed. Because of their size, they require a well-proportioned and highly nutritious diet fit for their unique digestive needs and any additional health concerns.\n\nIt's important to monitor the amount of food and treats that you give your Caucasian Shepherd, especially since some dogs may be prone to gaining weight as they age. Your veterinarian is always a good source to help provide you with appropriate nutrition and feeding guidelines.","care-grooming":"The Caucasian Shepherd Dog can have a coat that's short, medium, or long, and the care required of their coat will vary depending on the individual dog.\n\nFor example, Caucasian Shepherd Dogs with long coats will need daily grooming, while dogs with medium-length or short coats might be able to get away with weekly brushing to prevent mats and remove loose fur.\n\nAll dogs require regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care), including at-home teeth brushing and professional dental cleanings, and the Caucasian Shepherd Dog is no exception. Maintaining good dental hygiene is important for their overall long-term health.","care-exercise":"The Caucasian Shepherd Dog isn't quite as active as some other Shepherd breeds, but they still require daily exercise—like walking or hiking—to keep them healthy and happy. Remember to keep this breed on a leash or in a fenced-in area whenever they are outside.","care-training":"The Caucasian Shepherd Dog can be friendly and loving, but proper care and [socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) are essential to keep them from becoming unruly and aggressive. The breed's instinct is to protect their flock and the homes of their owners, and they can be very possessive and protective.\n\nThe Caucasian Shepherd Dog can be stubborn and independent, which often makes them harder—but not impossible—to train. Given their territorial and protective nature, you'll need to stay patient.\n\nThey aren't traditionally a good fit for a first-time dog owner, and their massive appearance can seem overwhelming to those who aren't sure how to handle them.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/caucasian-shepherd-dog/\n\nhttps://wagwalking.com/breed/caucasian-mountain-dog\n\nhttp://www.fci.be/Nomenclature/Standards/328g02-en.pdf","reviewed-by":"Cindy

1993, a Russian breeder in St. Petersburg crossed a Donskoy with a prize-winning Oriental Shorthair. (Donskoys are famous for their unusual trait of either being born hairless or losing their coats as they grow.) The resulting litter produced four kittens—one of which became the foundation stud of the Peterbald breed.\n\nPeterbalds can have several different coat types, ranging from completely bald to a regular short coat. One coat type even changes several times throughout the cat's life. The breed is in high demand, at least among people who know about it. Yet, it remains rather rare.\n\nThe International Cat Association granted the Peterbald Championship status in 2005.","facts":"Peterbalds are friendly, sweet-tempered, and incredibly rare cats. They make loyal pets and form deep attachments to their people. Alone time is wishful thinking when a Peterbald is in the house. These social kitties want to be involved in every moment of family life.","traits-appearance":"Peterbalds are elegant cats with long, lean bodies. They have distinctive coats and are known for their striking beauty.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Peterbald comes in five coat types: naked, chamois, flock, brush, and straight. All can come in any combination of colors and patterns.\n\nNaked Peterbalds are totally bald. Their skin is soft and warm, with a sticky, elastic feel. Chamois cats have a peach fuzz texture that's very soft. Flock cats have fine, velvety coats. Peterbalds with brush coats have sparse, wiry hair. And those with straight coats have normal, short coats that don't change over time.","traits-physical":"Other distinguishing features of the Peterbald include a long, triangular head with a blunt muzzle, extra-large, pointed ears, almond-shaped eyes, and long, whippy tails.","temperament":"Peterbalds are among the most social and interactive cat breeds. They become very attached to their humans (often picking one as their favorite) and are the ultimate lap cat.\n\nThese curious, outgoing kitties want to be involved in everything. They follow their family members around the house, usually talking to them as they go. And if they aren't trailing closely behind, it's probably because they are hitching a ride on someone's shoulders or are curled up next to them in bed.\n\nPeterbalds are playful cats that enjoy entertaining their people with silly antics. They're incredibly friendly and get along well with dogs, other pets, and kids. They thrive on daily attention and interaction and don't like to be left alone for long periods.","care-nutrition":"Peterbalds require a high-quality diet. Because nutritional needs vary for kittens, adults, and senior cats, opt for a formula that's age-appropriate for your pet.\n\nTo help Peterbalds maintain their slender body condition, monitor their food intake, and reduce portions if they start to gain excess weight. And don't forget to account for treats. As a guideline, they should make up no more than 10% of a cat's calories.\n\nFinally, all cats need access to fresh, clean water around the clock.","care-grooming":"The Peterbald's grooming routine varies based on their coat type. Hairless Peterbalds don't require brushing, but they do need baths every other week to remove excess oil from their skin. If spending time outdoors in the summer, they also must wear pet-safe sunscreen to protect their skin from sunburn. And in the winter, they may require a (fashionable) sweater to keep them warm. Peterbalds with any of the other coat types need only weekly brushing with a fine-tooth comb to remove loose hair.\n\nMost cats' nails require monthly trimming to prevent them from getting too long. Long nails are more likely to snag on something and become torn or damaged. They can even grow into your cat's paw pads, leading to pain or infection. In addition to clipping, providing a scratching post will allow your cat to do some nail maintenance themselves (thanks to their instinct to scratch).\n\nNo grooming routine is complete without a little dental hygiene.

While Laverack’s lines are now most closely associated with the show or “bench” lines of the English setter we know today, Llewellin sought to create an exclusively field-style or working bird dog without any physical exaggerations. Because the Llewellin is defined by its working ability, not appearance, it is often a little smaller than the show style [English Setter](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/english-setter), with a shorter coat and smaller ears, but with greater stamina and the ability to handle warmer temperatures.\n\nMany gundog enthusiasts describe the Llewellin as the premier quail hunting breed, and to this day, you will find show-style English setters referred to as Laveracks and working English setters as field setters or Llewellins. The reality is they are both English setters. ","facts":"The Llewellin Setter is an excellent hunting dog with a strong nose and a lovable personality. And with their beautiful ticked coats, they're sure to turn heads on your daily walks. ","traits-appearance":"Llewellin Setters are medium-sized dogs with athletic bodies. Their movement is effortless and energetic.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Llewellins have medium-length soft feathered coats. They come in black, white and tan; black and white; lemon and white; orange and white; liver and white; blue, lemon, orange, or liver belton; and solid white. Pups are born without any ticking or belton coloring, and develop those markings as they age.","traits-physical":"Llewellins are known for carrying their tails high to be seen in tall grass and brush. They have moderately-sized ears and a lighter build compared to their show cousins.","temperament":"Llewellins are hard-working, energetic pups. They have the stamina for long hunts and enjoy an evening curled up by the fire after a fun-filled day. This people-oriented breed is loyal and affectionate. And when properly exercised, they have a calm nature that makes them well-suited for families with kids.","care-nutrition":"The Llewellin Setter does well on high-quality dog food formulated for their age, size, and activity level. To help them maintain a healthy weight, measure their meals to avoid overfeeding and keep treats to 10% or less of their daily calories.\n\nBecause some have deep chests, they may be at greater risk of bloat (also known as twisted stomach). To help prevent bloat, break their food up into several meals a day and use a food bowl designed to slow their eating. Avoid feeding them immediately after vigorous activity, and wait at least an hour after eating before allowing them to run or exercise. These are just a few ways you can help prevent this life-threatening condition. A veterinarian is the best resource for other recommendations—including surgical options—for preventing bloat.","care-grooming":"This breed's medium-length coat requires daily brushing to remove loose fur and keep it free from tangles. Their pendant ears may put them at greater risk for ear infections. Be sure to check their ears regularly for debris or wax build-up and clean them as needed. Additionally, regular nail trims and [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) should be part of their grooming routine.","care-exercise":"This high-energy dog needs plenty of daily exercise. To help them stay healthy, plan to walk them briskly for at least an hour a day. Other activities to help them burn energy include long hikes, jogs, and games of fetch in an enclosed yard. \n","care-training":"The Llewellin is typically a quick learner. Use positive reinforcement and keep training sessions fun and varied for the best results. \n\nAdditionally, all dogs benefit from [early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization). Helping them feel comfortable with different people and environments when they're young will help them grow into well-adjusted adult

Vizsla","plural-name":"Wirehaired Vizslas","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The Wirehaired Vizsla originated in Hungary in the 1930s. Hunters and falconers wanted a breed with all of the favorable characteristics of the [Vizsla](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/vizsla)—plus a sturdier build and wiry coat that would protect it from northern Hungary's extreme cold and harsh landscape.\n\nSo, they crossed the Vizsla with the [German Wirehaired Pointer](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/german-wirehaired-pointer). Other breeds—such as the [Wirehaired Pointing Griffon](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/pointing-griffon-wire) and [Irish Setter](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/irish-setter)—might have been involved, as well. But almost all breeding records were lost during World War II, so no one knows for sure.\n\nWirehaired Vizslas came to the United States in 1970, and the AKC recognized the breed in 2014.","facts":"The Wirehaired Vizsla is an energetic, alert, and intelligent breed. Both a versatile hunting companion and an active family dog, the Wirehaired Vizsla is always up for adventure.","traits-appearance":"Wirehaired Vizslas are medium-sized, lean hunting dogs with dense, wiry coats and adorable beards and eyebrows.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Wirehaired Vizsla's wiry outer coat and dense undercoat protect against weather and injury. A shorter, softer, and thinner coat covers the lower legs and underside of the chest and belly.\n\nWirehaired Vizslas can be a variety of golden and red shades ranging from a light, sandy yellow to a deep red. A small amount of white on the chest is possible.","traits-physical":"Wirehaired Vizslas are best known for their facial furnishings. Pronounced eyebrows and a strong beard give these pups their distinguished (and quite handsome) appearance. Wirehaired Vizslas are also self-colored, meaning their eyes, lips, nose, and toenails blend with the color of their coats.","temperament":"The loyal Wirehaired Vizsla's high intelligence and energy make it a good breed for active families. But these dogs are excellent hunting companions, too, thanks to their innate pointing and retrieving skills.\n\nWirehaired Vizslas are typically calm house dogs (provided they get enough exercise). But when they're in play mode, they're upbeat and exuberant.\n\nDue to their strong hunting instincts, Wirehaired Vizslas may chase or hunt wildlife. A fully-fenced yard will help keep other critters safe from these eager canines. And though they're outgoing around people they know, Wirehaired Vizslas may be shy around strangers.","care-nutrition":"Wirehaired Vizslas require a high-quality, age-appropriate dog food—whether it's commercially manufactured or homemade (with a veterinarian's supervision and approval). These pups are very food-oriented and will happily accept (or seek out) a snack whenever they can. So, keep an eye on their food intake and weight. And don't forget to account for treats in their overall calorie intake. Treats should make up no more than 10% of a dog's calories.","care-grooming":"Keeping your Wirehaired Vizsla's coat looking its best is a relatively easy task. A quick wipedown with a wet cloth and the occasional bath are typically sufficient to keep this breed's wiry coat clean. When your Wirehaired Vizsla is shedding their undercoat, expedite the process with a grooming mitt or shedding knife to reduce the amount of hair that drops around your home.\n\nBe sure to inspect your Wirehaired Vizsla's nails for splits or cracks and trim them regularly. Nails that get too long can cause discomfort and lead to problems walking.\n\nFinally, maintaining good [dental hygiene](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) is essential for any dog's long-term health. In addition to scheduling professional dental cleanings, establish an at-home care routine that includes regular teeth brushing.","care-exercise":"True to their sporting heritage, Wirehaired Vizslas need a lot of daily exercise. Long walks, hikes, or backyard games of fetch will give them opportunities to burn off energy.\n\nOther good options include flyball, hunt-and-field trials, agility, tracking, competitive obedience, and other dog sports. These events provide not only great exercise but also mental stimulation.\n\nMost Wirehaired Vizslas enjoy a good swim, as well. And if you're looking for a jogging buddy, this may be the breed for you.","care-training":"Wirehaired Vizslas are intelligent, which means they get bored easily. So, aim to keep training sessions short and fun to hold your pup's attention.\n\nA sensitive breed, the Wirehaired Vizsla responds best to consistent, structured training and a gentle but firm tone.

Spotted cats resembling the Mau appear in frescoes dating back as far as 1550 B.C.\n\nDetails of the breed's origins aren't entirely known. But an analysis of cat mummies found in Egyptian tombs suggests the Mau descended from a subspecies of African Wildcat that migrated from Ethiopia.\n\nOne thing we know for sure is that Egyptian Maus were worshipped as deities and revered by royalty. Historical accounts report that family members mourning a Mau's death would shave their eyebrows as a sign of grief and bury the cat in linens and jewelry.\n\nThe modern Mau gained some popularity in Europe, but World War II took a toll on the cat fancy. The Egyptian Mau breeding program suffered, and after the war, Maus were in danger of becoming extinct. Fortunately, Italian breeders took it upon themselves to preserve the breed.\n\nA Russian princess imported the first Egyptian Maus from Italy to the United States in 1956. Those three cats became the foundation of the American breeding program. And in 1977, the CFA granted the breed Championship status.","facts":"Worshipped by ancient Egyptians for centuries, Egyptian Maus turn heads with their exotic-looking spotted coats. But it's their intelligence, loyalty, and devotion that stand out to those who know them best.","traits-appearance":"Egyptian Maus are medium-sized cats with well-developed muscles and an alert appearance. They often strike statuesque poses that show off their elegant, graceful bodies. They're also the only naturally spotted breed of domestic cat.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Maus come in smoke, silver, and bronze—as well as dilute versions of those colors. A great contrast exists between their body color and spots, and their markings can be any shape or size but should not run together. Fittingly, they have an \"M\" marking on their foreheads and a dorsal stripe that travels the length of their spines.\n\nThe Mau's coat is medium-length with a lustrous sheen. Smoke-colored cats have fine, silky hair. On the other hand, silver and bronze cats have dense hair with two or more bands of ticking.","traits-physical":"Maus have large, green, almond-shaped eyes that slant slightly towards the base of their ears, giving them a worried expression. Dark \"mascara\" lines start at the outer corner of their eyes and continue along their cheeks. Their ears are medium-to-large, broad at the base, and slightly flared, and their medium-long tails are heavily banded and dark at the tip. The breed walks with a trademark \"tiptoe\" stance because the hind legs are longer than the front.","temperament":"Egyptian Maus are people-oriented cats and fiercely loyal to their humans. They form tight bonds with their family members and like to shower them with affection. But they have firm opinions about who can handle them and when. They can be standoffish with strangers and may take some time to warm up to other pets.\n\nThis incredibly agile and athletic breed can jump six feet high from a standstill and run up to 30 miles per hour. So, daily exercise and play sessions are essential—and there are plenty of ways to help them release their pent-up energy. Maus are very spirited and enjoy running around the house, fetching, and walking on a leash. Should they get tired, you might find them hitching a ride on their favorite person's shoulders.","care-nutrition":"Egyptian Maus need a high-quality diet. Because nutritional needs vary for kittens, adults, and senior cats, opt for a formula that's age-appropriate for your pet.\n\nTo keep your cat at a healthy weight, measure out meals and reduce portions if necessary. And don't forget to account for treats. As a guideline, they should make up no more than 10% of a cat's calories.\n\nLastly, all cats need access to fresh, clean water around the clock.","care-grooming":"Egyptian Maus have low-maintenance coats. Weekly brushing is all it takes to keep their coats looking shiny and healthy.\n\nMost cats' nails require monthly trimming to prevent them from getting too long. Long nails are more likely to snag on something and become torn or damaged. They can even grow into your cat's paw pads, leading to pain or infection. In addition to clipping, providing a scratching post will allow your cat to do some nail maintenance themselves (thanks to their instinct to scratch).\n\nNo grooming routine is complete without a little dental hygiene. To support your Mau's overall health, brush their teeth daily and schedule visits with your veterinarian for professional dental cleanings and exams.","care-exercise":null,"care-training":null,"care-health":"Some breeds are more susceptible to certain health conditions. Egyptian Maus may be prone to urolithiasis (stones in the urinary tract) or leukodystrophy (a neurological disease).

The breed belongs to the Spitz family of dogs—the group most closely related to wolves. Experts believe the Laika's ancestors crossed with wolves and were selectively bred for temperament. The result of that effort is the breed we know today.\n\nSiberian hunters couldn't afford specialized dogs for different types of prey. So, the Laika became an all-around hunter used for birds and assorted small game. These dogs bark to alert the hunter when they locate game. That's how they got their name—the Russian word \"laika\" is a noun derived from the verb \"layat,\" which means \"barker.\"","facts":"Laikas are intelligent, energetic, and watchful dogs. Though originally bred for hunting, they make good guard dogs due to their attentive nature.","traits-appearance":"Laikas are medium-sized, powerfully built dogs with a wolf-like appearance.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Laikas have a thick double coat with harsh, straight hairs and a soft undercoat that protects them in arctic weather. Though usually black and white, their coats may also be red or pale red. And some Laikas are \"wolf\" grey—similar to their early ancestors. Grey coats can vary from very light to very dark and may have white patches in different proportions.","traits-physical":"The breed has a wedge-shaped head, dark, oval eyes, prick ears, and a tail that curls over the back.","temperament":"The Laika is a courageous, intelligent, highly versatile breed. These dogs are protective of their people and make excellent guard dogs. But they can sometimes be aloof or cautious with strangers.\n\nIt's essential to socialize these dogs so that they learn how to respond appropriately to different people and situations. Consistent training and reinforcement can also help them overcome any natural tendencies to guard toys, food, or other objects when sharing a household with other pets.","care-nutrition":"Laikas thrive on a high-quality diet formulated for their activity level, medium size, and life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). To help them maintain a healthy weight, monitor their food intake—including treats. As a rule, treats should make up no more than 10% of their calories.","care-grooming":"Laikas are naturally clean dogs that don't produce much (if any) smell. But their thick coats do need regular brushing to remove loose hair and prevent mats and tangles.\n\nMost of the year, brushing with a pin brush once or twice a week will suffice. But during seasonal shedding periods, daily brushing is needed to keep the hair from getting out of control.\n\nBeyond that, regular nail trims, ear cleanings, and teeth brushing should also be part of your pup's grooming routine.","care-exercise":"This active breed needs a lot of daily exercise to be happy and healthy. Long walks, hikes, and games within a fenced backyard will give these dogs an outlet for their boundless energy.","care-training":"Laikas are intelligent and very responsive to training. But they can be independent thinkers. So, a firm, consistent approach using positive reinforcement and rewards is the best way to teach these pups.","care-health":null,"references":"https://russkaja-laika.jimdofree.com/laika-breeds/\n\nhttps://www.ukcdogs.com/west-siberian-laika\n\nhttps://www.petguide.com/breeds/dog/west-siberian-laika/\n\nhttps://wagwalking.com/breed/west-siberian-laika","reviewed-by":"Jamie Freyer, DVM","date-reviewed":"2020-09-05T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":18.0,"weight-range-pet-max":30.0,"weight-range-show-min":18.0,"weight-range-show-max":30.0,"height-range-min":50.0,"height-range-max":63.0,"life-span-range-min":10.0,"life-span-range-max":12.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":null,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":null,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":null},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/770ae4f4-7d71-57e9-a13c-5074823053bd/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/770ae4f4-7d71-57e9-a13c-5074823053bd/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/770ae4f4-7d71-57e9-a13c-5074823053bd/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/770ae4f4-7d71-57e9-a13c-5074823053bd/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/770ae4f4-7d71-57e9-a13c-5074823053bd/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/770ae4f4-7d71-57e9-a13c-5074823053bd/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/770ae4f4-7d71-57e9-a13c-5074823053bd/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/770ae4f4-7d71-57e9-a13c-5074823053bd/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/770ae4f4-7d71-57e9-a13c-5074823053bd/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/770ae4f4-7d71-57e9-a13c-5074823053bd/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/770ae4f4-7d71-57e9-a13c-5074823053bd/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/770ae4f4-7d71-57e9-a13c-5074823053bd/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/770ae4f4-7d71-57e9-a13c-5074823053bd/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/770ae4f4-7d71-57e9-a13c-5074823053bd/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/770ae4f4-7d71-57e9-a13c-5074823053bd/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/770ae4f4-7d71-57e9-a13c-5074823053bd/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/770ae4f4-7d71-57e9-a13c-5074823053bd/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/770ae4f4-7d71-57e9-a13c-5074823053bd/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"77c94fd9-aaf6-563b-a8be-109b1fced264","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/77c94fd9-aaf6-563b-a8be-109b1fced264"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"poodle-medium","name":"Medium Poodle","plural-name":"Medium Poodles","published-at":null,"species":"dog","history":"The Medium Poodle—known in some parts of the world as the Moyen Poodle or the Klein Poodle—is a smaller version of the [Standard Poodle](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/poodle-standard). So, unpacking the history of the Medium Poodle begins with the original Poodle breed.\n\nDespite their strong association with the country, Poodles didn't originate in France. And no one really knows the full story behind the breed's origins. Poodles are likely related to the [Portguese Water Dog](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/portuguese-water-dog) and [Irish Water Spaniel](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/irish-water-spaniel). Some experts believe they originated in Central Europe or Russia, while others think they got their start in Spain or Portugal. Another common theory is that German soldiers brought the Poodle to France during the 1400s.\n\nRegardless of the breed's exact beginnings, everyone agrees that Poodles were bred for bird hunting and water retrieval. And their love of water is how they got their name. \"Poodle\" has its roots in an old German word meaning \"to splash about.\"\n\nWhat's the deal with the famous Poodle haircut? Hunters knew that Poodles would be more efficient swimmers if they had less hair. But less hair would leave them more vulnerable to the cold water. So, creative Poodle owners had an idea. They shaved most of the dog's body but strategically left puffs of hair to protect joints and vital organs from the cold. Problem solved.\n\nOver time, what's now known as the Standard Poodle was bred down to smaller sizes. Today, the Standard Poodle, Medium Poodle, [Miniature Poodle](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/poodle-miniature), and [Toy Poodle](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/poodle-toy)) all share the same breed standard.","facts":"True to their sporting dog category, Medium Poodles are athletic, smart, and eager-to-please. And like all Poodle varieties, they're also entertaining and elegant in everything they do.","traits-appearance":"The Medium Poodle is an elegant, well-proportioned breed with a frizzy and curly coat.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Medium Poodle's dense coat can be curly (frizzy curls over the whole body) or corded (even cords that hang in varying lengths). Poodle owners often give their pups stylized haircuts or a \"puppy clip\" that trims hair to an even length over the whole body.\n\nMedium Poodles come in a wide range of colors—including solid blacks, grays, silvers, browns, apricots, creams, and shading variations.","traits-physical":"The Medium Poodle has dark, oval-shaped eyes that offer an alert, intelligent expression. Covered in long, wavy hair, the ears are long enough to reach the corner of the lip when pulled forward.","temperament":"The Medium Poodle is an incredibly smart, playful, and athletic breed. Medium Poodles are usually friendly dogs that get along well with kids, dogs, and other pets. For anyone looking for all the benefits of a Standard Poodle—an active, family-oriented, non-shedding breed—in a slightly smaller package, the Medium Poodle fits the bill.\n\nMedium Poodles love people and form tight bonds with their families. And because of their sensitive nature, they even pick up on the moods of people they're close to. The combination of this intuitive nature and their willingness to please makes Poodles great assistance and therapy dogs.\n\nMedium Poodles may tend to bark or seem reserved around strangers. [Early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) can help prevent these behaviors.","care-nutrition":"Medium Poodles need a dog food formulated for their specific life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). Diets developed specifically for Poodles are also a great option to explore.\n\nTo prevent your Medium Poodle from becoming overweight, keep a close eye on their food portions. And be sure to take treats into account when tracking their daily calorie intake. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of your dog's calories.","care-grooming":"Medium Poodles have hair instead of fur. That means—unlike fur coats that grow to a point and then shed—a Poodle's hair keeps growing. Similar to human hair, this breed's hair does still fall out. But it usually falls back into their coats (instead of all over the house). Because of this minimal shedding, Medium Poodles are an excellent breed for people with allergies.\n\nThough Medium Poodles don't shed a lot, their coats still need regular grooming. To keep their hair free from mats and tangles, brush a few times a week. And because their hair grows continuously, plan on haircuts every month or so.\n\nIn addition to professional dental cleanings, Medium Poodles need an at-home dental care routine that includes regular teeth brushing.\n\nMaintaining good [dental hygiene](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) is essential for the overall long-term health of all dogs.","care-exercise":"The Medium Poodle is a very active breed that enjoys all the same activities as other dogs in the sporting group.

They inhabit areas in eastern Afghanistan, northern Pakistan, northern and coastal India, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Sumatra, Java, Bali, Borneo, Nepal, Korea, Cambodia, parts of the Philippines, Eastern China, and Taiwan, China.\n\nThese wild cats can live in various environments and elevations—including tropical forests, pine forests, jungles, mountainous regions, and semi-desert areas. They are typically unbothered by human activity and often live near villages, where locals sometimes rely on them for rodent control.\n\nIn 1963, breeder Jean S. Mill crossed domestic cats with the Asian Leopard cat to develop a new hybrid cat breed: the Bengal. Bengals are domesticated cats that people can keep as ordinary pets. Though Asian Leopard Cats are allowed as pets in some places, they require permits and are subject to strict regulations.\n\nOther wild cats included in the Leopard Cat grouping are the Asian Golden Cat, Bay Cat, Black-footed Cat, Fishing Cat, Flat-headed Cat, Jungle Cat, and Pallas Cat. The Pallas cat inhabits cold, dry terrains in central Asia, while the others live in wetland habitats.","facts":"Asian Leopard Cats are one of the most widespread carnivore species in Asia. They are known for their gorgeous spotted coats and their contributions to the Bengal cat breed.","traits-appearance":"Asian Leopard Cats are similar in size to large domestic cats. But they vary widely in size and color based on their geographic region.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Coat color for the Asian Leopard Cat can range from shades of yellow in southern populations to grey in northern regions. These cats have black rosettes on their sides and solid spots on their legs and tails. Four black stripes typically extend down the forehead to the nape. Their coat length varies according to their environment, with cats in the north having longer, thicker fur.","traits-physical":"Other distinguishing characteristics of the Asian Leopard Cat include a small head, short narrow muzzle, long rounded ears, and golden-brown to greyish eyes.","temperament":"Asian Leopard Cats are mostly solitary, nocturnal animals—though males and females sometimes raise their young together. They primarily hunt at night and often spend their days resting in dens made in hollow trees.\n\nThese cats are proficient climbers and capable of swimming, though they prefer not to do the latter. If kept in captivity, they require large outdoor enclosures that allow them to roam freely.","care-nutrition":"The Asian Leopard Cat’s diet consists mainly of rodents. But they also eat plant matter and—given the opportunity—will feast on chickens from poultry farms.","care-grooming":"Asian Leopard Cats groom themselves to keep clean and remove their scent (which helps keep potential prey from detecting them while they lie in wait).","care-exercise":null,"care-training":null,"care-health":"Asian Leopard Cats are at risk for several domestic cat diseases, including Feline Immunodeficiency Virus. If kept in captivity, they need many of the same vaccines as modern pet cats. However, they require a veterinarian trained and licensed in exotic animal care.","references":"https://www.wildcatfamily.com/leopard-cat-lineage/\n\nhttps://wildcatconservation.org/wild-cats/asia/leopard-cat/\n\nhttps://wildcatsmagazine.nl/wild-cats/asian-leopard-cat-prionailurus-bengalensis\n\nhttps://pethelpful.com/exotic-pets/small-exotic-cats","reviewed-by":"Annette Louviere, DVM","date-reviewed":"2021-02-23T00:03:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":3.6,"weight-range-pet-max":6.8,"weight-range-show-min":null,"weight-range-show-max":null,"height-range-min":null,"height-range-max":null,"life-span-range-min":10.0,"life-span-range-max":13.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":null,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":null,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":null},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/77cc85e8-ad4d-53a0-8704-fef0969d5cc5/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/77cc85e8-ad4d-53a0-8704-fef0969d5cc5/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/77cc85e8-ad4d-53a0-8704-fef0969d5cc5/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/77cc85e8-ad4d-53a0-8704-fef0969d5cc5/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/77cc85e8-ad4d-53a0-8704-fef0969d5cc5/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/77cc85e8-ad4d-53a0-8704-fef0969d5cc5/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/77cc85e8-ad4d-53a0-8704-fef0969d5cc5/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/77cc85e8-ad4d-53a0-8704-fef0969d5cc5/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/77cc85e8-ad4d-53a0-8704-fef0969d5cc5/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/77cc85e8-ad4d-53a0-8704-fef0969d5cc5/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/77cc85e8-ad4d-53a0-8704-fef0969d5cc5/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/77cc85e8-ad4d-53a0-8704-fef0969d5cc5/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/77cc85e8-ad4d-53a0-8704-fef0969d5cc5/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/77cc85e8-ad4d-53a0-8704-fef0969d5cc5/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/77cc85e8-ad4d-53a0-8704-fef0969d5cc5/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/77cc85e8-ad4d-53a0-8704-fef0969d5cc5/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/77cc85e8-ad4d-53a0-8704-fef0969d5cc5/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/77cc85e8-ad4d-53a0-8704-fef0969d5cc5/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"781336b7-918a-5123-bef6-dc34fefbf59c","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/781336b7-918a-5123-bef6-dc34fefbf59c"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"english-toy-terrier-black-and-tan","name":"Black and Tan English Toy Terrier","plural-name":"Black and Tan English Toy Terriers","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"This breed's ancestor, the Black and Tan Terrier, was developed for the now-outlawed sport of rat-baiting.

As such, the UK Kennel Club has opened the stud books to American Kennel Club-registered Toy Manchester Terriers to increase numbers.","facts":"The Black and Tan English Toy Terrier is a watchful, affectionate breed that loves to spend time with people. Due to their small size, these dogs are well-suited for a variety of living environments. Black and Tan English Toy Terriers have attention-seeking personalities and are typically good with children.","traits-appearance":"Sturdy and compact, the Black and Tan English Toy Terrier is a small breed that looks very similar to the Manchester Toy Terrier.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The smooth-coated, short-haired Black and Tan English Toy Terrier is, as you might expect, black and tan.","traits-physical":"Petite and trim, the Black and Tan English Toy Terrier has ears that stand upright and taper toward their tops in a pointy, candle flame-like fashion. The breed also has a tapered tail.","temperament":"This high-spirited, intelligent, and eager-to-learn breed has a true terrier nature and temperament. For the most part, Black and Tan English Toy Terriers are loving, approachable, and completely loyal to family. As a result, they don't like to be left alone for any length of time.\n\nSuitable for both urban and rural living, Black and Tan English Toy Terriers are good with older children. Interaction with younger children, however, should be supervised.\n\nThe Black and Tan English Toy Terrier may be wary around strangers and attempt to hunt other small animals. You should [socialize your pup](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) with other pets and kids early in their life.","care-nutrition":"Black and Tan English Toy Terriers need a high-quality diet that's formulated for their age and size. As you should with any dog, monitor the amount of food your Black and Tan English Toy Terrier eats, and reduce the portions if your pup gains weight. Also, consider that giving too many treats in addition to regular meals can contribute to obesity.","care-grooming":"Because Black and Tan English Toy Terriers have short, dense coats, they require little grooming. Occasional brushing with a grooming mitt and polishing cloth should be all your dog needs to stay looking sharp.","care-exercise":"The English Toy Terrier doesn't need a lot of exercise. About 30 minutes of movement every day should be enough—though your dog will surely enjoy more if you have an active lifestyle.\n\nAs for the type of exercise, English Toy Terriers excel in dog sports—including earthdog trials, lure coursing, agility, tracking, flyball, and both rally and competitive obedience.","care-training":"An intelligent breed, the Black and Tan English Toy Terrier tends to be stubborn.

Also known as Kochi Ken, Mikawa Inu, and Japanese Wolfdog, the Shikoku Ken was bred to hunt deer and boar in the mountain districts of the Kochi Prefecture of Japan. This job earned the breed the nickname \"boar hound.\"\n\nThere were initially three varieties of the breed: Awa, Hongawa, and Hata—all named after the areas in which they were bred. Dogs in the Hata line had stockier builds, broader skulls, and thicker, longer coats. In contrast, Hongawa dogs had more elegant builds with long, strong limbs and weatherproof coats. The modern Shikoku Ken is a mix of all three lines.\n\nJapan declared the Shikoku Ken a Natural Monument (protected species) in 1937.","facts":"The graceful, stoic Shikoku Ken may be standoffish with strangers and require firm training to temper guarding instincts. But this intelligent, active breed tends to be loyal and submissive to its family.","traits-appearance":"The medium-sized Shikoku Ken is compact and muscular. The breed has a thick, powerful neck, curled tail, pricked ears, and a keen, alert appearance.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Shikoku Ken is a double-coated dog with a soft, dense undercoat and harsh, straight outercoat. The breed comes in three colors: red, black and tan, and sesame (a mixture of red and black). In all color variations, the dogs should have \"urajiro\"—white or cream markings—on the underside portions of the body, legs, and cheeks.","traits-physical":"The Shikoku Ken has several unique features. The dog's small, triangular, dark brown eyes turn up at the outer edges. Its petite, pricked ears tilt forward. And the breed's thick, high-set tail curls over the back—almost touching the hocks.","temperament":"A member of the working group, the Shikoku Ken historically hunted in the mountainous regions of Japan. As a result, the breed grew to be tough, agile, and resilient in harsh conditions.\n\nThough submissive to their owners, Shikoku Kens are often aloof with strangers and need [early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) to subdue their predatory instincts and prevent aggression toward other dogs. The breed can be mouthy and must be watched around children. As fast learners, Shikoku Kens require firm, consistent leadership. Without it, the breed may be stubborn and relentless.\n\nBecause Shikoku Kens are vocal, they don't make the best apartment dogs. They tend to growl (not bark). And though these growls aren't usually intended to be aggressive, they can send the wrong message to both humans and dogs. As such, this breed is not a great fit for dog parks.","care-nutrition":"Shikoku Kens need a high-quality dog food that is appropriate for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). Also, consider a diet formulated for medium-sized dogs. And to keep your Shikoku Ken from becoming overweight, measure out meals and give treats sparingly.","care-grooming":"An occasional bath and brushing are all the Shikoku Ken needs to stay clean. This breed's thick, fast-growing nails require regular trimming to avoid splitting, cracking, or becoming overgrown—which can be painful. Finally, all dogs benefit from a [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) routine that includes at-home teeth-brushing and professional dental cleanings.","care-exercise":"Shikoku Kens require moderate exercise—such as brisk walks, off-leash play, and games in fenced yards. Swimming, hiking, dog sports, and other high-intensity activities are also great options. And don't forget brain workouts! Hide-and-seek games and puzzle toys provide essential mental stimulation.\n\nDuring outdoor activities, remember that this breed is unreliable off-leash and may never achieve reliable recall.

This landrace dog lives alongside the native people of the Himalayan Mountain region, serving as a guardian to their property and livestock.\n\nThese dogs are known by many regional names that coincide with the shepherds that utilize them, but are thought to come from common ancestral stock, and represent varieties of the same landrace, rather than separate breeds. Examples include the Do-khyi (Tibetan Cultural Area), Bhote Kukur (Nepal), Gaddi Kutta and Bhutia (India), Bankhar (Mongolia), Bjop Chi (Bhutan), and Bakarwal Dog (Pakistan). \n","facts":"The Himalayan Mountain Dog is one of the oldest landraces of dogs. They are confident, intelligent dogs with an independent nature and a natural desire to protect.","traits-appearance":"Himalayan Mountain Dogs are robust, agile dogs that have adapted to survive in high altitude and challenging environments.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The HMD has a thick double coat consisting of an insulating, water-proof undercoat and a weather-resistant top coat. The top layer of the mane blends into a shawl that extends over the shoulders, down the spine, and over the hips before blending into the breeches. They also have feathering on their shoulders, legs, and tail. The undercoat is shed in the warm summer months.\n\nCoat colors for the Himalayan Mountain Dog include red, black, sable, liver, and brindle. Their coats may also have tan points, white markings, or ticking, and their color may be dilute. ","traits-physical":"The Himalayan Mountain Dog has a broad head, high-set triangular pendant ears, a muscular body, and a tail that's carried over the back when alert. They have broad muzzles with well padded lips, but are dry-mouthed, and lips are never pendulous.","temperament":"The HMD has strong protective instincts, making them ideal guard dogs. Though these hardworking, intelligent pups have an independent nature, they bond closely with their people and pack. However, they are typically reserved with strangers.","care-nutrition":"The HMD does well on high-quality dog food formulated for their age, size, and activity level. In particular, puppies may benefit from a large-breed growth diet. These specially formulated diets help prevent large breed dogs from growing too fast, which may decrease the likelihood or severity of hip dysplasia as they age.\n\nTo help this breed maintain a healthy weight, measure their meals to avoid overfeeding and keep treats to 10% or less of their daily calories.\n","care-grooming":"The HMD's thick double coat requires frequent brushing to remove loose fur. In the summer, they may shed their undercoats entirely. \n\nIn addition to brushing, regular ear checks, nail trims, and [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) should be part of their grooming routine.","care-exercise":"This breed requires moderate daily exercise to stay in tip-top shape. Leashed walks and opportunities to roam freely in large, enclosed areas are great ways for them to keep active and survey their surroundings.","care-training":"The Himalayan Mountain Dog is an intelligent breed that likes to learn. However, they are independent thinkers that require consistent, firm training and short, engaging training sessions that hold their interest.\n\nIn addition to obedience training, all breeds benefit from [early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization). Helping them feel comfortable with different people and environments when they're young will help them grow into well-adjusted adult dogs.","care-health":null,"references":"https://himalayanmountaindogclub.org/HMD-Breed-Standard-OFFICIAL.pdf\nMesserschmidt, D.

Hovawart dates as far back as the Middle Ages. The origins of the breed's name—\"hova\" for yard or farm, and \"wart\" for watchman—explain the breed's main job: guardianship over the flocks, castles, and farms of the German barons. Though highly valued throughout medieval times, the Hovawart breed later faced near-extinction twice.\n\nIn the early 1900s, the Hovawart began to lose its popularity to breeds like the [German Shepherd](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/german-shepherd-dog). But in 1922, breeders in the German Harz Mountains formed a Hovawart club and set out to reconstruct the breed. Led by zoologist Kurt Friedrich König, the club cross-bred the remaining Hovawarts with other working breeds. These included the German Shepherd, [Leonberger](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/leonberger), [Newfoundland](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/newfoundland), and [Kuvasz](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/kuvasz).\n\nIn 1937, the Hovawart received official recognition from the German Kennel Club. But the breed's reconstruction effort suffered the effects of World War II. Many of the Hovawarts joined the German war effort, and only a few remained after 1945.\n\nFortunately, breed enthusiasts rallied again to recreate the breed, forming the German Hovawart Club. Though still rare in most parts of the world, the Hovawart is a popular working dog in Germany and the Scandinavian countries. The breed first appeared in the UK in 1980 and now holds full AKC recognition.","facts":"The Hovawart is a strong-willed, faithful, and intelligent breed. Developed to watch over homes and livestock in Germany, Hovawarts make outstanding guards and search and rescue dogs.","traits-appearance":"The Hovawart is a powerful, medium-sized, slightly elongated, long-haired working dog.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Hovawart's long-haired, dense coat is lightly waved—with only a slight undercoat—and longer on the chest, belly, back of legs, and tail.\n\nHovawarts come in three color variations: black with tan points (known as black and gold), black, or blond (a golden color similar to a Golden Retriever). According to the breed standard, the coat of blond dogs should become lighter on the legs and belly. It may have small white areas on the chest or single white hairs on the toes or tips of the tail.","traits-physical":"The Hovawart has triangular drop ears set high and wide apart, giving the optical illusion of a broad skull. The breed's bushy tail extends past the hocks, but not all the way to the ground.","temperament":"Hovawarts are affectionate, trustworthy, and obedient. They're also highly intelligent but can be stubborn and strong-willed. As such, Hovawarts require significant time and attention. But they make excellent companions for experienced owners.\n\nBecause they originated as working dogs, Hovawarts like to have a job to do. If they get bored, they may take it upon themselves to find something (undesirable) to do to keep busy.\n\nHovawarts may be reserved with strangers. This quality, along with their protective nature, makes them excellent watchdogs.","care-nutrition":"Hovawarts require a high-quality diet that's appropriate for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior) and activity level. They also benefit from diets formulated specifically for large-breed dogs.\n\nTo keep your Hovawart at a healthy weight, monitor their food intake carefully. It's a good idea to use a measuring cup when portioning out their meals to avoid accidental overfeeding. And don't forget to count calories from treats in their daily totals. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of a dog's calories.","care-grooming":"Most of the year, occasional brushing is enough to keep the Hovawart's coat in good shape. More frequent brushing during periods of seasonal shedding will keep the dog's coats free of loose hair.\n\nThe Hovawart's nails grow fast. Trim them regularly to keep them from cracking or splitting. Overgrown nails can lead to pain or trouble walking or running.\n\nLong ears may make Hovawarts more susceptible to ear infections. Check and clean their ears regularly to prevent infections from developing.\n\nFinally, maintaining good [dental hygiene](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) is essential for the overall long-term health of all dogs. In addition to scheduling professional dental cleanings, aim to establish an at-home dental care routine that includes regular teeth brushing.","care-exercise":"Hovawarts are large, active dogs that need plenty of room for their daily exercise. A large fenced yard is ideal, as it provides ample space for the big breed to run and play. Long walks, hikes, and trips to the dog park are other great ways for Hovawarts to burn off energy. They also enjoy activities such as search and rescue and tracking.","care-training":"Hovawarts have strong guarding instincts and need training to help them understand the appropriate use of this behavior. [Early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization), in particular, can help you curb your dog's natural guarding tendencies.\n\nHovawarts can also be strong-willed and stubborn. Consistency, patience, and positive reinforcement are the best ways to build and sustain trust during training

Springer Spaniel","plural-name":"Welsh Springer Spaniels","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The Welsh Springer Spaniel has been around since at least the 14th century. But dogs resembling the breed show up in art and literature from 250 B.C. So, the Springer Spaniel may be one of the oldest breeds in existence.\n\nSpringer Spaniels came to Wales from Brittany, supporting the belief that the Welsh Springer Spaniel and the [Brittany Spaniel](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/brittany) share the same ancestry. And like all springers, the Welsh Springer Spaniel was bred to locate and flush out (or \"spring\") game from the bushes.\n\nBecause they worked in rough terrain and extreme weather, Springer Spaniels needed to be sturdy, agile dogs with great stamina and swimming ability. Breeders refined these traits during the Renaissance, and they are the standards still held today.\n\nPeople initially referred to the breed as the \"Welsh Spaniel\" or \"Welsh Cocker.\" When the dogs gained popularity in America in 1902, the breed earned its current \"Welsh Springer Spaniel\" name. But the owners who love them often call these dogs \"Welshies.\"","facts":"The Welsh Springer Spaniel is an intelligent, energetic, and playful breed. Though these dogs were bred for their versatile hunting skills, it's their loyal, affectionate nature and stunning good looks that have captured hearts for centuries.","traits-appearance":"The Welsh Springer Spaniel is a medium-sized dog with a compact, well-muscled build and a gorgeous red and white coat.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The coat of the Welsh Springer Spaniel is naturally straight and soft to the touch. It's also dense enough to provide protection from water, weather, and thorns. The breed's legs, chest, ears, and tails have various degrees of feathering.\n\nWelshies have unmistakable red and white coats—with the white areas often flecked with red. The red can vary slightly in hue, but it's generally deep and vibrant.","traits-physical":"Welsh Springer Spaniels have slightly domed skulls and straight muzzles. As such, their heads are shaped differently compared to other spaniels. Springer Spaniels' round, paddle-like feet enable them to swim powerfully.","temperament":"The Welsh Springer Spaniel is an energetic and easygoing breed. These good-natured, happy dogs are excellent with children and friendly towards other pets.\n\nWelsh Springers thrive on human companionship. However, they tend to be suspicious of people they don't know—perhaps because they prefer to reserve all their affection and devotion for their families! If it were up to them, they'd never leave their family's side. For this reason, Welshies don't do well when left alone for long periods.","care-nutrition":"Welsh Springer Spaniels require a high-quality dog food that is age-appropriate—whether it's commercially manufactured or homemade (with a veterinarian's supervision and approval).\n\nIt's important to monitor the amount of food you give your Welsh Springer Spaniel. Reduce the portions or restrict calories if your pup gains weight. Also, remember that giving too many treats in addition to regular meals can contribute to obesity.","care-grooming":"Welshies are known for their beautiful coats (and the tumbleweeds of fur they leave behind when they molt). To keep your Welsh Springer Spaniel looking their best, brush them with a soft brush at least once a week—and more often during periods of seasonal shedding. If fur tangles or mats form, use a metal comb to work them out.\n\nBecause of their long ears, Welshies may be more susceptible to ear infections. For this reason, check and clean their ears regularly to prevent infections from developing.\n\nMaintaining good [dental hygiene](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) is essential for any dog's long-term health. In addition to professional dental cleanings, establish an at-home care routine that includes regular teeth brushing.","care-exercise":"Welsh Springer Spaniels are high-energy dogs that need plenty of exercise and mental stimulation every day. If they get bored, they may find undesirable ways to entertain themselves. So, it's best to channel their energy into non-destructive activities.\n\nFor example, you can take your Welsh Springer Spaniel on long walks and hikes, or let them run free in a fenced backyard. Because they love to swim and play in the water, try throwing tennis balls or floating toys in the water for them to retrieve.\n\nWelshies also enjoy dog sports that exercise their bodies and minds—such as field trials, hunting, tracking, agility, and competitive obedience.","care-training":"Though Welsh Springer Spaniels are intelligent and eager to please, they're also sensitive and known to have a stubborn streak. To train a breed with this temperament, use gentle handling techniques and lots of positive reinforcement. And to help them develop into well-mannered, well-adjusted dogs, [socialize Welsh Springer Spaniels early and often](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization).\n\nFood can be an effective motivator for Welshies. During training sessions—or \"teachable moments\" that come up—use their favorite treats as rewards for desired behavior. For instance, offer them something tasty as a trade for inappropriate objects they've retrieved and claimed as their own (such as your new pair of slippers).","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/lifestyle/6-facts-welsh-springer-spaniel/\n\nhttp://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/WelshSpringerSpaniel.pdf\n\nhttps://www.welshspringerspaniel.club/the-breed/is-a-welsh-springer-for-you/","reviewed-by":"Cindy Elston, DVM, MPH","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":14.5,"weight-range-pet-max":25.4,"weight-range-show-min":16.8,"weight-range-show-max":20.0,"height-range-min":48.0,"height-range-max":53.0,"life-span-range-min":12.0,"life-span-range-max":15.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":109,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":70,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":46},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7a20f66e-6ee7-5c3c-bec6-90b1132c3cfd/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7a20f66e-6ee7-5c3c-bec6-90b1132c3cfd/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7a20f66e-6ee7-5c3c-bec6-90b1132c3cfd/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7a20f66e-6ee7-5c3c-bec6-90b1132c3cfd/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7a20f66e-6ee7-5c3c-bec6-90b1132c3cfd/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7a20f66e-6ee7-5c3c-bec6-90b1132c3cfd/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7a20f66e-6ee7-5c3c-bec6-90b1132c3cfd/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7a20f66e-6ee7-5c3c-bec6-90b1132c3cfd/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7a20f66e-6ee7-5c3c-bec6-90b1132c3cfd/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7a20f66e-6ee7-5c3c-bec6-90b1132c3cfd/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7a20f66e-6ee7-5c3c-bec6-90b1132c3cfd/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7a20f66e-6ee7-5c3c-bec6-90b1132c3cfd/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7a20f66e-6ee7-5c3c-bec6-90b1132c3cfd/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7a20f66e-6ee7-5c3c-bec6-90b1132c3cfd/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7a20f66e-6ee7-5c3c-bec6-90b1132c3cfd/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7a20f66e-6ee7-5c3c-bec6-90b1132c3cfd/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7a20f66e-6ee7-5c3c-bec6-90b1132c3cfd/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7a20f66e-6ee7-5c3c-bec6-90b1132c3cfd/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"7a9df04b-9de9-5a24-926f-aefaae55b7c3","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7a9df04b-9de9-5a24-926f-aefaae55b7c3"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"grand-anglo-francais-tricolore","name":"Grand Anglo-Francais Tricolore","plural-name":"Grands Anglo-Français Tricolores","published-at":"2023-09-19T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The Grand Anglo-Francais Tricolore originated in France in the 1800s. The breed came about by crossing [English Foxhounds](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/english-foxhound) with native scent hounds from the west of France, like the Bâtard Anglo-Saintongeois. The breed was, and still is, used to hunt large game like boar and deer in large packs (grande vénerie) with hunters on horseback. The French call these types of hunting dogs the chien d’ordre. \n\nThe French Kennel Club,  Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI), and United Kennel Club all recognize the Grand Anglo-Francais Tricolore. Today, the breed remains primarily a hunting dog and is considered a rare breed.","facts":"The Grand Anglo-Francais is a best-of-both-worlds breed, combining qualities from French and English hounds to create a natural hunter with a keen sense of smell.","traits-appearance":"The Grand Anglo-Francais is a solidly-built, large breed dog with a distinctive air.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Anglo-Francais Tricolore displays typical hound tri-colors, with black patches or a black blanket and bright or copper tan patches, sometimes with “louvard” or mottled patches. The breed's coat is short and reasonably coarse.","traits-physical":"Notable traits of this breed include large brown eyes, medium-length ears, a deep, broad chest, well-chiseled face, and a good-length tail that's densely haired.","temperament":"This breed is a hunting dog at heart. Though they can adapt to home life, they are happiest when using their keen noses or hunting in groups. These pups are hardworking and typically get along well with people, kids, and other dogs.\n\nBecause they are prone to wandering off when following a scent, it's best to keep them on a leash or in an enclosed area when they're not hunting.","care-nutrition":"This breed does well on high-quality dog food formulated for their age, size, and activity level. To help them maintain a healthy weight, measure their meals to avoid overfeeding and keep treats to 10% or less of their daily calories.","care-grooming":"The Anglo-Francais Tricolore’s coat is relatively easy to maintain. Though they do shed, weekly brushing will remove loose hair and keep them looking their best. Additionally, regular ear checks, nail trims, and [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) should be part of their grooming routine.","care-exercise":"This breed has a lot of energy and stamina. At a minimum, they require daily brisk walks. A fenced yard where they can run, play and get more vigorous exercise will help them stay physically and mentally fit.","care-training":"The Anglo-Francais Tricolore is eager to please but also has a stubborn streak. They respond best to consistent and firm training techniques and positive reinforcement using treats or favorite toys as rewards.\n\nIn addition to obedience training, all breeds benefit from [early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization).

Shar-Pei","plural-name":"Chinese Shar-Pei","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"A breed as old as the Chinese Shar-Pei is bound to have a few wrinkles. Experts think this majestic dog dates back to the Han Dynasty in China. It's been depicted in artwork from 200 B.C. And references to \"wrinkled dogs\" appear in ancient Chinese manuscripts.\n\nIn rural China, the working class prized the Chinese Shar-Pei as an excellent farming and hunting dog. These muscular, do-it-all canines hunted wild boars, herded livestock, and guarded against predators. And if that weren't enough, the Chinese Shar-Pei's blue-black tongues even warded off evil spirits (according to folklore).\n\nDespite their popularity, the breed once faced extinction. When China's nascent communist government disapproved of dogs and imposed a tax on them, many Chinese Shar-Peis were eliminated. But a few of the breed remained in rural areas and outlying regions.\n\nIn 1973, a breeder in Hong Kong named Matgo Law launched a concerted effort to save the breed. Increased media focus skyrocketed interest in Chinese Shar-Peis—catapulting these wrinkle-faced pups from \"the world's rarest dog\" to one of the world's most popular breeds. Today, it's one of the most ancient breeds recognized by the American Kennel Club.","facts":"The Chinese Shar-Pei is a unique-looking dog with a wrinkled face, tiny ears, and a blue-black tongue. These dogs are often suspicious of strangers and excel at guarding. An ancient breed, the Chinese Shar-Pei has also been used in farming and hunting for centuries.","traits-appearance":"The Chinese Shar-Pei is a medium-sized dog with a square profile, oversized head, petite, triangle-shaped ears, and small, sunken eyes. Their flat, wrinkled muzzle has been compared to that of a hippopotamus.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The word \"shar-pei\" means \"sand skin\"—a reference to the breed's coarse, sandpaper-like coat. A soft coat is actually considered a major flaw in the breed by American Kennel Club standards.\n\nThe Chinese Shar-Pei has two coat lengths: A \"horse coat\" is extremely short, whereas a \"brush coat\" is longer but still shorter than one inch at the withers. This breed's fur can be one of several solid colors—including apricot, black, black sable, blue, brown, cream, fawn, and red. Darker shading down the back and on the ears is considered acceptable in show.","traits-physical":"Bountiful folds of loose skin on the head, neck, and withers are the breed's most distinguishing features. Chinese Shar-Pei puppies have wrinkles covering their entire bodies.\n\nThis breed also has a blue-black tongue, muzzle, gums, and mouth. Only one other breed shares this distinct feature: [the Chow Chow](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/chow-chow).","temperament":"Aloof and reserved, the Chinese Shar-Pei can become territorial and reactive without adequate training and socialization.\n\nThese alert, intelligent watchdogs develop strong attachments to their owners. And though they generally tolerate children, they aren't known for being overly affectionate or enjoying rough play.\n\nFiercely loyal to their people, Chinese Shar-Peis are generally not welcoming to strangers, other dogs, or smaller animals. And they may respond with aggression if they feel threatened. As such, Shar-Peis don't always make great family pets.","care-nutrition":"You should feed your Chinese Shar-Pei a high-quality dog food that is appropriate for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). To prevent obesity, monitor how much your dog eats, and reduce portions and treats if necessary. As a general rule, treats should make up no more than 10% of a dog's calories.","care-grooming":"It doesn't take much grooming to keep Chinese Shar-Peis looking good. But the folds in their skin can harbor infection and need to be wiped out with a damp cloth regularly. In addition, the breed requires occasional baths and routine nail trims.\n\nThe Chinese Shar-Pei's short ears are prone to infection. But frequent ear cleaning can help prevent problems. Skip the cotton swabs and hydrogen peroxide and use an ear-cleaning solution to flush debris from the ear canal.\n\nChinese Shar-Peis, like all dogs, also require regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care). It's best to start an at-home dental hygiene routine (that includes regular teeth brushing and professional dental cleanings) when your dog is young.","care-exercise":"An adaptable breed, the Chinese Shar-Pei is just as content tagging along for a long walk as it is lounging on the sofa. Known for their calm and alert demeanor, most Shar-Peis require minimal exercise and rarely bark—making them excellent apartment dogs. However, the breed does overheat easily and should avoid high-intensity exercise.","care-training":"Skipping out on training can result in serious problems with the Chinese Shar-Pei—an independent, strong-willed breed. Because these dogs tend to rebel against harsh punishment, you should use consistent, positive training methods, praise, and treats.\n\nTraining and [early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization), including puppy-training classes, can help a Chinese Shar-Pei become a well-mannered companion.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/chinese-shar-pei/\n\nhttp://www.vetstreet.com/dogs/chinese-shar-pei#history\n\nhttps://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/dog-breeds/chinese-shar-pei\n\nhttp://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/ChineseSharPei.pdf","reviewed-by":"Annette Louviere, DVM","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":18.1,"weight-range-pet-max":30.8,"weight-range-show-min":18.1,"weight-range-show-max":27.2,"height-range-min":46.0,"height-range-max":51.0,"life-span-range-min":8.0,"life-span-range-max":12.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":84,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":52,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":39},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7bce4ea8-f0cd-5fa0-9e0f-011d65acdab6/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7bce4ea8-f0cd-5fa0-9e0f-011d65acdab6/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7bce4ea8-f0cd-5fa0-9e0f-011d65acdab6/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7bce4ea8-f0cd-5fa0-9e0f-011d65acdab6/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7bce4ea8-f0cd-5fa0-9e0f-011d65acdab6/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7bce4ea8-f0cd-5fa0-9e0f-011d65acdab6/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7bce4ea8-f0cd-5fa0-9e0f-011d65acdab6/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7bce4ea8-f0cd-5fa0-9e0f-011d65acdab6/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7bce4ea8-f0cd-5fa0-9e0f-011d65acdab6/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7bce4ea8-f0cd-5fa0-9e0f-011d65acdab6/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7bce4ea8-f0cd-5fa0-9e0f-011d65acdab6/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7bce4ea8-f0cd-5fa0-9e0f-011d65acdab6/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7bce4ea8-f0cd-5fa0-9e0f-011d65acdab6/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7bce4ea8-f0cd-5fa0-9e0f-011d65acdab6/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7bce4ea8-f0cd-5fa0-9e0f-011d65acdab6/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7bce4ea8-f0cd-5fa0-9e0f-011d65acdab6/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7bce4ea8-f0cd-5fa0-9e0f-011d65acdab6/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7bce4ea8-f0cd-5fa0-9e0f-011d65acdab6/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"7bf488f8-72b3-52b5-b6d1-e300131d82c6","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7bf488f8-72b3-52b5-b6d1-e300131d82c6"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"lakeland-terrier","name":"Lakeland Terrier","plural-name":"Lakeland Terriers","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"Lakeland Terriers originated in the early 20th century in the Lake District region of northern England. Once known as the Patterdale, Fell, and Elterwater Terrier, the breed hunted foxes, otters, and badgers to great success. Thanks to their build and agility, they could pursue prey deep into tunnels.\n\nBecause of World War I, there was no serious interest in Lakeland Terriers until 1921—at which time they earned their current name. One of the oldest surviving working terrier breeds, the Lakeland Terrier received American Kennel Club recognition in 1934.","facts":"Lakeland Terriers are intelligent and inquisitive dogs. They love to explore and be with their families—whether on an outdoor adventure or hanging out at home. This kid-friendly breed is gentle, quiet, and finds human companionship irresistible.","traits-appearance":"The Lakeland Terrier has a boxy shape and is well-muscled for a small dog. Contact yet athletic, it's quite representative of the terrier group.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Lakeland Terrier has a wiry double coat, which may be straight or slightly wavy over the body. This coat comes in various colors, including blue (gray), black, liver, red, and wheaten. Some Lakeland Terriers have a darker saddle pattern that comes in black, blue, liver, or grizzle (i.e., some black hairs).","traits-physical":"Small, folded, V-shaped ears flank the Lakeland Terrier's rectangular head. The breed also has long legs (at least compared to most terriers).","temperament":"Self-assured, bold, energetic, and (sometimes) clownish all describe the Lakeland Terrier. Intense, hardworking dogs, Lakeland Terriers aren't afraid of taking on whatever comes their way.\n\nLakeland Terriers are also alert and will bark to make themselves heard. These qualities make them effective watch dogs. They generally like people and are usually friendly with other dogs. However, they may chase or hunt wildlife due to their natural hunting instincts. In fact, they may take off after anything that's running.\n\nOnce Lakelands lock in on an activity—such as barking or digging—they can be difficult to disengage.","care-nutrition":"The Lakeland Terrier requires a high-quality, age-appropriate dog food. And it's important to monitor the amount of food your Lakeland Terrier eats and reduce the portions if they gain weight. Also, remember that giving too many treats in addition to regular meals can contribute to obesity.","care-grooming":"Lakelands have a rough double coat that needs a gentle pull (called plucking). You can clip the top layer of dead fur, but this may cause the coat's color to fade. Once clipped, the coat turns out soft, loose curls. Weekly brushing will help prevent loose hairs and mats.\n\nThe Lakeland Terrier is considered a non-shedding breed. For this reason, Lakelands may be a good option for those with allergies or anyone who can't bear the thought of dander.","care-exercise":"Lakeland Terriers are very playful and require ample physical and mental exercise. Though they're not overly energetic, they enjoy long walks, jogs alongside a bicycle, and hardy play in a securely fenced area.\n\nLakelands also like to participate in many dog sports—such as earthdog trials, retrieving, agility, tracking, and flyball. Hiking and swimming are other fun activities to try.","care-training":"Training for Lakeland Terriers should be consistent and gentle. They are a smart breed and quick to learn, but they don't like repetition. Though determined, Lakeland Terriers respond well to reward-based training approaches. (For example, you can try exchanging a tasty treat for something they shouldn't have retrieved.)\n\n[Early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) with other pets is

Münsterlander","plural-name":"Large Münsterlanders","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The Large Münsterlander—not to be confused with the [Small Münsterlander](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/munsterlander-small)—originated from the Münster region of Germany in the early 1900s.\n\nThis breed used to be a black-and-white variation of the [German Longhaired Pointer](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/german-longhaired-pointer). It wasn't until 1919, when the German Longhaired Pointer Club stopped recognizing the black color variation, that the Large Münsterlander gained recognition as a unique breed.\n\nIn Germany and other countries, the Large Münsterlander has served for decades as a versatile hunting companion rather than a show dog. The breed excels in all facets of hunting. They're strong swimmers, purposeful searchers, and can track a variety of game.\n\nKurt von Kleist introduced the Large Münsterlander to America in 1966. Globally, the breed's numbers have gradually spread thanks to the devotion of dedicated breeders. But the Large Münsterlander is still relatively rare in the U.S.","facts":"The Large Münsterlander is an intelligent, energetic, trainable, and usually friendly breed. Active, outdoorsy people looking for a versatile hunting companion and calm house dog won't be disappointed with the easy-going Large Münsterlander.","traits-appearance":"The Large Münsterlander has a strong and muscular body, yet it gives a racy impression overall. The breed is known for its clean outline and intelligent, noble expression.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Large Münsterlander's coat is long and dense enough to protect from cold weather and thorns found in thick cover while hunting.\n\nThe coat comes in three varieties: white with black patches and spots, blue roan, and pure black. The Large Münsterlander's head is always black, though sometimes has a white blaze.","traits-physical":"With a noble, elongated head and strong, long, and well-developed muzzle, the Large Münsterlander emanates strength and refinement. The ears are broad and rounded at the tip, with long fringes of hair that reach to the end of the ear. The tail is feathered and carried horizontally.","temperament":"The Large Münsterlander is characteristically calm, gentle, and intelligent—ideal qualities for family dogs and skilled hunting companions alike.\n\nAll Large Münsterlanders need regular physical activity. But some have more nervous energy than others, thus requiring extra exercise before they can be laid-back housemates.\n\nBecause of their strong hunting instincts, Large Münsterlanders may chase small pets or wildlife, bark, or dig.","care-nutrition":"Large Münsterlanders need a high-quality diet that's appropriate for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior) and activity level.\n\nTo prevent your dog from becoming overweight, keep a close eye on their food portions. And be sure to take treats into account when tracking their daily calorie intake. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of a dog's calories.","care-grooming":"In general, Large Münsterlanders only need occasional brushing and bathing to keep their coats clean and healthy. However, their long hair attracts burs, which must be picked off after a day spent hunting in thick cover.\n\nThe Large Münsterlander's nails will wear down during daily activity. But you should still inspect them regularly for splits or cracks, and trim them as needed to maintain an ideal length.\n\nMaintaining good [dental hygiene](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) is also important for the overall long-term health of all dogs. In addition to professional dental cleanings, Large Münsterlanders need a regular at-home dental care routine that includes teeth brushing and dental chews or treats.","care-exercise":"Large Münsterlanders need daily exercise. Long walks, backyard play sessions, and trips to the lake for a swim are all fun activities that will give your dog the outlet they need for their energy.\n\nThese naturally athletic pups also love participating in canine sports such as field trials, tracking, agility, and obedience. And because of their sporting dog backgrounds, they're always happy to retrieve items such as tennis balls or frisbees.","care-training":"Large Münsterlanders are intelligent and easily trained. As with all breeds, [early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) can help your Large Münsterlander pup grow into a well-mannered adult dog.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.gundogmag.com/editorial/breed-profile-the-large-munsterlander/175611\n\nhttp://www.largemunsterlander.org/breed-history.html\n\nhttp://www.fci.be/Nomenclature/Standards/118g07-en.pdf","reviewed-by":"Cindy Elston, DVM, MPH","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":24.5,"weight-range-pet-max":37.6,"weight-range-show-min":27.2,"weight-range-show-max":32.7,"height-range-min":58.0,"height-range-max":66.0,"life-span-range-min":10.0,"life-span-range-max":12.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":101,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":65,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":43},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7d66215b-6e0c-5928-b4bb-eb4f77a14291/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7d66215b-6e0c-5928-b4bb-eb4f77a14291/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7d66215b-6e0c-5928-b4bb-eb4f77a14291/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7d66215b-6e0c-5928-b4bb-eb4f77a14291/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7d66215b-6e0c-5928-b4bb-eb4f77a14291/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7d66215b-6e0c-5928-b4bb-eb4f77a14291/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7d66215b-6e0c-5928-b4bb-eb4f77a14291/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7d66215b-6e0c-5928-b4bb-eb4f77a14291/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7d66215b-6e0c-5928-b4bb-eb4f77a14291/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7d66215b-6e0c-5928-b4bb-eb4f77a14291/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7d66215b-6e0c-5928-b4bb-eb4f77a14291/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7d66215b-6e0c-5928-b4bb-eb4f77a14291/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7d66215b-6e0c-5928-b4bb-eb4f77a14291/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7d66215b-6e0c-5928-b4bb-eb4f77a14291/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7d66215b-6e0c-5928-b4bb-eb4f77a14291/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7d66215b-6e0c-5928-b4bb-eb4f77a14291/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7d66215b-6e0c-5928-b4bb-eb4f77a14291/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7d66215b-6e0c-5928-b4bb-eb4f77a14291/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"7d69accf-ffbc-5699-a76f-57fe6ddfc3ce","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7d69accf-ffbc-5699-a76f-57fe6ddfc3ce"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"boxer","name":"Boxer","plural-name":"Boxers","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The history of the Boxer dates back to 19th century Germany. Now extinct, ancestors of the Boxer included the Bullenbeiszer and the Barenbeiszer, which were used for hunting deer and boar. The crossing of these breeds with the English Bulldogs of the 1830s resulted in the Boxer as we know it today.\n\nBoxers were bred to be hunting dogs, and they earned their name from the boxing pose they take when standing on their hind legs. Later in the breed's development, they also gained some ability for herding.\n\nOver the years, Boxers have taken on many roles. These include athlete, cattle dog, police dog, war dog (in both World Wars I and II), watchdog, protection dog, and guide dog for the blind. They were also used for dogfighting and bull-baiting until those activities were outlawed. And circuses even used Boxers for their ability to learn tricks quickly and perform them on command.\n\nThe popularity of Boxers started to increase rapidly in the 1860s when the German Boxer Klub was founded. At the turn of the 20th century, the Boxer made its way to the United States, and the American Kennel Club officially recognized the Boxer in 1904.","facts":"Boxers are intelligent, hardworking, and good-looking dogs. They are very loyal and affectionate to their family, as well as playful and gentle. This makes them great with children. So, it's no wonder that the Boxer has earned a reputation as one of America's most popular dog breeds.","traits-appearance":"The Boxer has a rippled, muscular look. Their dark brown eyes and wrinkled forehead contribute to their alert and curious expression. A well-shaped head and a broad, blunt muzzle are common characteristics of the Boxer. The breed's stride is like that of an athlete: sleek and effortless, with a powerful forward thrust.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Boxer coats can be fawn or brindle with white markings. The breed doesn't do well in freezing weather due to its short coat.","traits-physical":"Boxers are medium-sized and sturdy. They can be stocky or lean with a short back, sturdy limbs, and a short coat that shows off their bodies' contours. The well-developed muscles of the Boxer are clean, hard, and appear smooth under taut skin.","temperament":"The upbeat Boxer is very active, playful, and curious. It has a gentle nature and is good with other animals. Known to paw at their toys and food, Boxers can be expressive of their needs and temperament.\n\nA very protective breed, Boxers make excellent watchdogs and family guardians. Yet, they are typically friendly toward strangers. To promote their social development, you should expose them to various people and other animals in early puppyhood.\n\nBoxers are incredibly energetic and powerful even as puppies. So, bringing one into a home with young children or elderly adults may be unwise.","care-nutrition":"Boxers require a high-quality dog food that is age-appropriate—whether it's commercially manufactured or homemade (with a veterinarian's supervision and approval). For puppies, experts recommend a food formulated for large breeds.\n\nBoxers tend to stay at a healthy weight. But it's still important to monitor the amount of food you give your Boxer and reduce portions or restrict calories if your pup gains weight. Also, remember that giving too many treats in addition to regular meals can cause obesity.","care-grooming":"The short, shiny coat of the Boxer is relatively maintenance-free and requires little grooming. Shedding an average amount, Boxers are clean dogs that only need an occasional bath. Once or twice a week, brushing your Boxer with a rubber curry-brush or a hound glove will help keep them looking their best.","care-exercise":"As a high-energy and playful dog, the Boxer needs plenty of exercise every day—whether it's on a leash, in your yard, or in the park. It's not a good idea, however, to let them run loose.","care-training":"A brilliant breed, Boxers are quick to learn but can be both sensitive and stubborn. They love to jump, and when trained, their skills as guards, military dogs, and watchdogs are outstanding. But Boxers can get restless if they don't receive enough exercise.\n\nBecause they are hardwired to jump and leap about, Boxers need constant reminders when young to stay down. They really do best with firm owners who use reward-based training, set limits, and maintain control.\n\n[Socialization and puppy training classes](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) should start early to help channel the Boxer's energy. These dogs are highly intelligent and tend to hate repetition. So, offering a wide range of canine activities and mental stimulation that involve obedience, agility, and herding skills will help them be their best.\n\nBoxers are top-notch service, assistance, and therapy dogs, and they serve well in drug detection and search-and-rescue roles.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/boxer/\n\nhttps://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/dog-breeds/boxer","reviewed-by":"Cindy Elston, DVM,

Terrier","plural-name":"Border Terriers","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The Border Terrier originated in the borderlands that separate England and Scotland in the early 18th century. Farmers used these scrappy little dogs for ratting in the barn and hunting hill fox.\n\nWhen hunters went after a fox, these dogs accompanied them and chased foxes down into their underground dens. Border Terriers also proved to be skilled at hunting otter, rabbit, and badger. Hunters could identify where their Border Terriers were by listening for their barking.\n\nOver time, the breed became a popular family pet. The American Kennel Club officially recognized the Border Terrier 1930.","facts":"Border Terriers are energetic, intelligent, and alert dogs. Their friendly and affectionate nature makes them a welcome addition to any household.","traits-appearance":"Border Terriers are medium-boned dogs with narrow shoulders, short, muscular necks, and brawny hindquarters.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Border Terrier’s coat comes in either red, tan and grizzle (black hairs in the coat), or wheaten. Combinations of these colors, black points, and black masks are also possible.","traits-physical":"Border Terriers have a characteristic otter-like head that’s relatively broad and flat. Their ears are small and V-shaped.","temperament":"Border Terriers are happy-go-lucky, social dogs that provide their people with endless entertainment. They’re good with kids and friendly toward other dogs. But because of their background as small animal hunters, they may chase little pets and wildlife. For the same reason, this breed also tends to bark and dig.\n\nBorder Terriers are diligent workers and good-tempered, affectionate companions at home.","care-nutrition":"Border Terriers need a high-quality dog food that is age-appropriate—whether it’s commercially manufactured or homemade (under a veterinarian’s supervision and approval).\n\nSome dogs are prone to becoming overweight. It’s important to monitor the amount of food you give them and reduce portions if your pup gains weight. Also, keep in mind that giving too many treats in addition to regular meals can contribute to obesity.","care-grooming":"Like most double-coated breeds, Border Terriers shed seasonally. Most of the year, a quick brushing every week or two keeps their coats in tip-top condition. But during seasonal shedding periods, plan on a daily 30-minute session to strip out dead hair.\n\nYou can skip the bath, though. The Border Terrier’s coat naturally repels dirt, and bathing actually impairs this ability.\n\nOvergrown nails can lead to pain or issues walking. So, trim regularly to keep them at an appropriate length.","care-exercise":"Border Terriers love being outdoors, and many activities make them happy pups. Vigorous backyard play sessions, romps in the yard, and brisk walks are all great ways to provide needed exercise.\n\nBut remember, this breed is hardwired to chase small animals. So, time outside should be in an enclosed area or on a leash.\n\nBorder Terriers also seem to enjoy dog sports such as agility, tracking, flyball, rally, and competitive obedience.","care-training":"Border Terriers are eager to learn and respond well to reward-based training using their favorite treats. Gentle training—rather than a harsh approach—works best for this breed.\n\nPuppy training classes and [early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) help all dogs get off to a good start. Exposing Border Terriers to as many people and situations as possible when they’re young helps them develop into well-adjusted adult

Eskimo Dog","plural-name":"Canadian Eskimo Dogs","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"Not to be confused with the petite [American Eskimo Dog](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/american-eskimo-dog), the Canadian Eskimo Dog has had several names—including Qimmiq, Exquimaux Husky, and Esquimaux Dog. The Inuit people used Canadian Eskimo Dogs to hunt polar bears and find seal blow holes in the ice.\n\nThe Thule people of Greenland and Arctic Canada kept Canadian Eskimo Dogs as pets and working dogs for more than 1,000 years. And in the 19th and 20th centuries, Arctic and Antarctic explorers chose these iconic dogs as companions for their intelligence, strength, and endurance.\n\nCanadian Eskimo Dogs were once so popular that their number was estimated at more than 20,000. But by 1970, the breed had almost disappeared. This sharp population decrease caused the American Kennel Club to drop the breed from its registries. In response, a multi-stakeholder group—which included the Canadian Kennel Club—formed the Canadian Eskimo Dog Research Foundation in Canada's Northwest Territories to help restore the breed.\n\nThe Canadian Eskimo Dog has been recognized as one of Canada's oldest breeds and become an icon of Canadian culture. The breed was featured on a postage stamp and the 50-cent piece. And it was chosen as the animal symbol of the Nunavut territory in Canada.","facts":"One of just five breeds indigenous to Canada, the Canadian Eskimo Dog is known for its strength, endurance, and ability to withstand frigid temperatures. Though it was once on the brink of extinction, this iconic Arctic breed survived thanks to efforts to save its populations.","traits-appearance":"Like other Arctic dogs, the Canadian Eskimo Dog has long, thick fur and a dense undercoat to protect from extreme winter conditions. The breed also has a powerful, medium-sized build.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Canadian Eskimo Dogs come in many colors—including white, red, buff, cinnamon, grey, black, and sable. Their fur grows up to six inches in length and comes in a range of patterns.","traits-physical":"Canadian Eskimo Dogs have unique face masks and a wolf-like appearance. And males have longer hair around their neck and shoulders, resembling a mane.","temperament":"Despite their cute and cuddly appearance, Canadian Eskimo Dogs are not well-suited for domestic life. As working dogs bred to perform arduous tasks in harsh environments, they're happiest when given a task. That said, Canadian Eskimo Dogs can be relaxed, affectionate, and friendly once exercised.\n\nA pack-oriented breed that often over-responds to stimuli like food and toys, the Canadian Eskimo Dog isn't great for families with children. And because of their hunting dog background, Canadian Eskimo Dogs have strong predatory instincts that make them less compatible with other pets. In multi-dog households, strong leadership and a well-established pack order are essential.\n\nCanadian Eskimo Dogs have a tendency to guard resources such as food and toys. So, you must set firm rules early on and [socialize your puppy](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) to prevent undesirable behaviors. Canadian Eskimo Dogs can also be vocal. They howl instead of barking, making them less than ideal for apartment living.\n\nThis breed's Arctic roots run deep. Canadian Eskimo Dogs love sub-zero temperatures and don't adapt well to living in temperate climates.","care-nutrition":"Canadian Eskimo Dogs are a high-energy breed and require a quality dog food that is age-appropriate—whether commercially manufactured or homemade (with a veterinarian's supervision and approval). Historically, they've enjoyed a diet consisting of walrus, seal, caribou, and fish.\n\nThis breed is known to work hard with very little nourishment. So, Canadian Eskimo Dogs usually don't overeat. Still, it's important to monitor the amount of food you give your dog and reduce portions or restrict calories if they gain excess weight. Also, remember that giving too many treats in addition to regular meals can contribute to obesity.","care-grooming":"In general, weekly brushing will help keep your Canadian Eskimo Dog's thick coat looking good. But this breed requires additional grooming during the late summer to promote shedding of the dense undercoat. A coat rake helps with this, as well as matted fur (which can lead to skin problems).\n\nLike all dogs, Canadian Eskimo Dogs also require regular nail trims, ear cleanings, and [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care), including at-home teeth brushing and annual professional dental cleanings.","care-exercise":"Canadian Eskimo Dogs were bred to haul large loads across long distances, often covering up to 40 miles per day. So, it should come as no surprise that they require regular physical activity. And a walk around the block isn't enough. This breed needs lots of outdoor exercise with room to romp.\n\nAnd even if they get it, Canadian Eskimo Dogs may look for opportunities to escape and run free. So, a tall, partially buried fence is crucial to prevent climbing and digging.","care-training":"Training should begin when Canadian Eskimo Dogs are puppies. Positive, reward-based methods will help establish a pack order with you, not the dog, as the leader. And that will allow you to better control the breed's guarding tendencies.\n\nCanadian Eskimo Dogs can be gentle and enjoy affection—even from strangers. But [early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) is key to encouraging those behaviors. Even with rigorous training, Canadian Eskimo Dogs must be supervised around children. And they should not be let off the leash in unsecured areas.","care-health":null,"references":"https://nationalpurebreddogday.com/qimmiq-279-left/\n\nhttps://www.ckc.ca/CanadianKennelClub/media/Breed-Standards/Group%203/Canadian-Eskimo-Dog.pdf\n\nhttps://www.ckc.ca/en/Choosing-a-Dog/Choosing-a-Breed/Working-Dogs/Canadian-Eskimo-Dog\n\nhttps://www.canadianeskimodog.com/about-us","reviewed-by":"Cindy

hunting dogs. In the 19th century, German breeders created the Hanovarian Hound by crossing dogs known as “Bracken” or those skilled at following ground scents in hunting.\n\nWhen new hunting methods—such as firearms—came about in the mid-19th century, it became apparent that hunting dogs would be needed more for retrieval. Needing a more streamlined breed for long-distance tracking, Baron Karg-Bebenburg Reichenhall decided to breed the Mountain Scenthound with the Hanovarian Hound to produce the Bavarian Mountain Hound.\n\nToday, the breed is still an excellent companion for hunters and gamekeepers.","facts":"The Bavarian Mountain Hound is truly man’s best friend—a loyal, loving, smart, and calm companion. The calm, balanced breed tends to be wary around strangers, but they aren’t overly shy or aggressive.","traits-appearance":"The Bavarian Mountain Hound is an agile, medium-sized dog with a balanced, muscular build. Its tail is often level or slanting downwards.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"A Bavarian Mountain Hound has a short, dense, glossy coat with distinct colorings spanning the whole of reds. You’ll find Bavarian Mountain Hounds with deep to “deer red” coloring, or even a lighter tan in some cases, with a much darker color on the back and muzzle.","traits-physical":"Although they are a medium, muscular dog, the most stunning aspect of Bavarian Mountain Hounds is their coloring, which is a variety of reds and appears much darker on the back and muzzle.","temperament":"When it comes to a canine companion, it would be hard to find one more loyal than a Bavarian Mountain Hound; they are entirely devoted to their owners.\n\nBred from the best hunting stock, these dogs don’t do well in small, confined spaces. Instead, they need ample space to roam and explore, as well as plenty of exercise and mental stimulation.\n\nThis breed is intelligent, so be sure to keep them on a leash or in areas with high fencing. They tend to become escape artists—digging holes or climbing fences—when they need entertainment.\n\nThey can be reserved or wary around strangers—and they much prefer hanging with their humans to spending time in a kennel—but they aren’t overly shy or aggressive. Although Bavarian Mountain Hounds get along well with other dogs, [early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) and training can help them tolerate strangers and other animals.","care-nutrition":"Bavarian Mountain Hounds require high-quality, age-appropriate dog food. As with any dog, it’s important to monitor the amount of food and treats that you give your Bavarian Mountain Hound to ensure they stay a healthy weight. Your veterinarian is always a good source to help provide appropriate nutrition and feeding guidelines.","care-grooming":"The Bavarian Mountain Hound has a dense, close fitting coat that still requires regular weekly brushing. Their nails are also fast-growing, so they require regular trims with a grinder or nail clipper.\n\nAll dogs require regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care), including at-home teeth brushing and professional dental cleanings, and the Bavarian Mountain Hound is no exception. Maintaining good dental hygiene is important for overall long-term health.","care-exercise":"The Bavarian Mountain Hound enjoys using its intelligence and fitness for hunting, and is best suited for life in a more rural setting. They can be cunning when bored, jumping fences or digging holes under them.\n\nAlthough most Bavarian Mountain Hounds are owned and used by professional hunters, if you can keep this dog properly exercised and mentally stimulated, they make excellent companions.","care-training":"Proper and early training is important for the Bavarian Mountain Hound, since it is an intelligent and active breed that requires daily physical and mental stimulation.\n\nWhen left untrained and without the proper exercise, these dogs become bored, which often leads to destructive habits.","care-health":null,"references":"http://www.fci.be/Nomenclature/Standards/217g06-en.pdf\n\nhttps://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/bavarian-mountain-scent-hound/","reviewed-by":"Cindy Elston, DVM, MPH","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":17.0,"weight-range-pet-max":29.9,"weight-range-show-min":17.0,"weight-range-show-max":29.9,"height-range-min":43.0,"height-range-max":52.0,"life-span-range-min":10.0,"life-span-range-max":14.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":85,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":54,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":39},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7f6627d7-2681-5899-9613-7d98cac7d33e/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7f6627d7-2681-5899-9613-7d98cac7d33e/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7f6627d7-2681-5899-9613-7d98cac7d33e/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7f6627d7-2681-5899-9613-7d98cac7d33e/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7f6627d7-2681-5899-9613-7d98cac7d33e/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7f6627d7-2681-5899-9613-7d98cac7d33e/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7f6627d7-2681-5899-9613-7d98cac7d33e/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7f6627d7-2681-5899-9613-7d98cac7d33e/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7f6627d7-2681-5899-9613-7d98cac7d33e/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7f6627d7-2681-5899-9613-7d98cac7d33e/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7f6627d7-2681-5899-9613-7d98cac7d33e/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7f6627d7-2681-5899-9613-7d98cac7d33e/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7f6627d7-2681-5899-9613-7d98cac7d33e/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7f6627d7-2681-5899-9613-7d98cac7d33e/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7f6627d7-2681-5899-9613-7d98cac7d33e/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7f6627d7-2681-5899-9613-7d98cac7d33e/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7f6627d7-2681-5899-9613-7d98cac7d33e/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7f6627d7-2681-5899-9613-7d98cac7d33e/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"7f6e129c-e1b6-4603-967a-65f01c4e60e1","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/7f6e129c-e1b6-4603-967a-65f01c4e60e1"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"laizhou-hong","name":"Laizhou Hong","plural-name":"Laizhou Hong","published-at":"2023-09-19T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The Laizhou Hong (also known as the Chinese Red Dog, “hong” meaning red) dates back to the late 19th century. Historians believe Germans brought European dogs with them when they colonized the Shandong province, including [Great Danes](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/great-dane), [Rottweilers](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/rottweiler), and [German Shepherd Dogs](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/german-shepherd-dog). These dogs were crossed with local Shandong breeds, including the [Xian Hound](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/shanxi-xigou). Some lines may also have included [Doberman Pinscher](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/dobermann-pinscher) as well. These crossings developed into what is now known as the Laizhou Hong. \n","facts":"The Laizhou Hong is a brave, intelligent dog from China’s Shandong province, combining characteristics of both European and Chinese dogs. This intelligent breed makes an excellent guard dog and loyal family companion.","traits-appearance":"The Laizhou Hong is a large, athletic dog with a strong head, deep chest, and muscular legs.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"This breed has a short, dense coat that's black with rich red markings on the muzzle, cheeks, throat, chest, and legs in tan pointed pattern.","traits-physical":"Notable traits of this breed include almond-shaped amber or dark brown eyes, large bat-like ears that stand erect, and in many cases, darkly pigmented gums and tongue.","temperament":"The Laizhou Hong may have started as a guard dog, but they also make friendly, loving companions. Just be sure to give them plenty of mental stimulation, so they don't get bored and resort to destructive habits.\n\nThis energetic breed gets along with other dogs—especially when raised with them as puppies—and makes a great playmate for sturdy kids. However, because of their naturally protective personalities, they may be wary of strangers. ","care-nutrition":"The Laizhou Hong does well on high-quality dog food formulated for their age, size, and activity level. In particular, puppies may benefit from a large-breed growth diet. These specially formulated diets help prevent large breed dogs from growing too fast, which may decrease the likelihood or severity of hip dysplasia as they age. This is particularly relevant for the Laizhou Hong, as the breed may be at increased risk of hip and elbow dysplasia (conditions worth screening for when they’re young).\n\nTo help this breed maintain a healthy weight, measure their meals to avoid overfeeding and keep treats to 10% or less of their daily calories.","care-grooming":"This breed's short coat is easy to maintain. While they don't require frequent brushing, a once-over with a brush every week or so will remove loose fur and dirt. Additionally, regular ear checks, nail trims, and [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) should be part of their grooming routine.","care-exercise":"The Laizhou Hong is an athletic breed with a lot of stamina.

At some point, a number of wolves became domesticated (but experts disagree on exactly when and how). And over time, it became clear that these domesticated canines could perform many useful jobs—from pulling sleds to herding sheep to protecting livestock.\n\nAs a result, people began selectively breeding them to strengthen the traits that made them excel in specific areas or conditions. This effort resulted in the many purebred dogs that we know and love today. But the majority of dogs around the world do not belong to a particular breed. This includes Honduran street dogs.\n\nAlso known as \"Aguacateros,\" Honduran street dogs live in towns or rural areas. Some locals take them in as pets or use them as guard dogs. But as conditions in Honduras have declined and people flee the country searching for a better life, many dogs have been abandoned. So, animal welfare groups and dedicated individuals are working to help control the population of Honduran street dogs and provide shelter and veterinary care to these needy pups.","facts":"Honduran street dogs are free-roaming pups that typically congregate in cities or towns with plentiful resources. They share many basic traits with pet dogs, but they lead primarily independent lives outdoors.","traits-appearance":"Though typically medium in size, Honduran street dogs come in all shapes and sizes.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Street dogs typically have short, brownish coats. But any combination of coat colors, patterns, and lengths is genetically possible.","traits-physical":"Honduran street dogs do not follow a breed standard. So, no shared set of traits links them together. That said, common characteristics of street dogs include prick ears and pointed noses.","temperament":"Street dogs must learn to fend for themselves. As a result, they tend to be scrappy, intelligent, and adaptable—all skills that support independent survival. Because they've never had to rely on humans, they may be fearful or skeptical of people who have not earned their trust.","care-nutrition":"A Honduran street dog's diet typically consists of whatever they can kill or find—small farm animals, scraps from trash cans, handouts from kind strangers, and so on. If you're leaving food out for a street dog, they'll benefit from commercial diets formulated for pet dogs.\n\nBecause they fend for themselves, street dogs aren't usually at risk of becoming overweight. However, if you take a street dog under your roof, keep an eye on their food intake to avoid overfeeding. Guidelines on dog food packages are a good starting point when determining daily portions.","care-grooming":"If you've adopted a street dog that's comfortable being handled, regular brushing and nail trims will help them look their best. Good [dental hygiene](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) is also important for any dog. Professional cleanings and at-home dental care will keep their mouths healthy and reduce the risk of related health issues.","care-exercise":"All dogs need exercise to stay physically and mentally fit, and street dogs are no exception. Honduran street dogs that are on their own will get adequate exercise during their daily roaming. Pet dogs, however, need access to the outdoors to stretch their legs and get mental stimulation. Playing in a fenced yard and going for leashed walks are great ways for your dog to release energy.","care-training":"Street dogs are not accustomed to obeying commands from people. In fact, many may avoid close contact with humans. Before attempting a training program, start by building trust and respect with your dog. Slow and steady is the best approach to making inroads with a street dog.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.rover.com/blog/village-dogs-around-the-world/\n\nhttps://bestfriends.org/stories-blog-videos/latest-news/dogs-honduras\n\nhttps://www.animal-kind.org/post/2018/12/11/honduras-a-40-year-perspective-on-animal-welfare-and-the-environment\n\nhttps://www.companionanimalpsychology.com/2015/03/can-street-dogs-become-good-pets.html","reviewed-by":"Laura

Pinscher","plural-name":"Miniature Pinschers","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"Breeders developed the Miniature Pinscher in Germany to hunt rats in stables. The breed is not a miniature version of the [Doberman Pinscher](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/dobermann-pinscher), as commonly thought. In fact, the Miniature Pinscher is much older than the Doberman, though the two breeds share some common ancestors.\n\nMiniature Pinschers were very popular in Germany and Scandinavia before their widespread introduction to other countries in the early 1900s.\n\nThe breed came to the United States in 1919 and received recognition from the American Kennel Club in 1929.\n\nFans of these dogs affectionately refer to them as \"Min Pins\"—a nickname that's almost as charming as the Miniature Pinscher itself.","facts":"Miniature Pinschers are intelligent, curious, and energetic. Though very loyal to their families, they're often suspicious of strangers—qualities that make them great watchdogs. An eager-to-please, fast-learner, the Miniature Pinscher is an excellent pet.","traits-appearance":"The Miniature Pinscher has a smooth, shiny coat and a sturdy, wedge-shaped build.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Min Pins come in solid colors with shades of red or stag red (i.e., red with some shading from black hairs). They can also be chocolate or black with red markings.","traits-physical":"The Miniature Pinscher has a solid build, elegantly curved neck, tapered head, and erect ears. However, the most striking feature is a characteristic hackney-like gait, which resembles a high-stepping horse.","temperament":"The Miniature Pinscher is a high-spirited, intelligent, alert, and proud breed. These pups are eager to please, and quite the entertainers once they get your attention.\n\nMiniature Pinschers are generally good with children. However, they need to be monitored when around very young kids for the safety of all involved. It's also necessary to keep an eye on these dogs to prevent them from getting into trouble. An unsupervised Min Pin may grab items from cupboards and tabletops or escape from the yard.\n\nBecause of their small size, Miniature Pinschers may be intimidated by other dogs. This reaction can trigger defensive barking or confrontations. Min Pins are also inclined to bark in general, thanks to their hunting backgrounds.\n\nIf properly trained, Miniature Pinschers make delightful therapy dogs that provide comfort and love with no strings attached.","care-nutrition":"Miniature Pinschers require a high-quality, age-appropriate dog food. It can be commercially manufactured or homemade (under a veterinarian's supervision and approval).\n\nIt's essential to carefully monitor the amount of food you feed your Miniature Pinscher and reduce portions if your pup gains weight. Also, remember that giving too many treats in addition to regular meals can contribute to obesity.","care-grooming":"The short, hard coat of the Miniature Pinscher is a breeze to maintain. Sweeping the coat with a soft brush or a hound glove will keep it in tip-top condition.","care-exercise":"Miniature Pinschers are active and athletic dogs that enjoy a variety of activities. Walks around the block, play sessions, and games are all great ways to meet their physical and mental needs.\n\nThough Min Pins enjoy their couch potato time, they're just as eager to race to the back yard to chase a ball. They also do well in canine sports—such as agility and obedience competitions—and learn tricks quickly.","care-training":"Though they often bond with their families, Miniature Pinschers may be wary of other people and dogs. [Early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) and puppy training classes are a core part of raising a courteous and well-rounded dog.\n\nMin Pins are sometimes a bit stubborn. You can reduce this tendency by incorporating motivational tools, such as tasty treats and favorite toys, into a reward-based training program.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/miniature-pinscher/\n\nhttps://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/dog-breeds/miniature-pinscher\n\nhttps://www.google.com/books/edition/Miniature_Pinscher/hNYJBgAAQBAJ","reviewed-by":"Annette Louviere, DVM","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":1.8,"weight-range-pet-max":5.4,"weight-range-show-min":2.0,"weight-range-show-max":4.1,"height-range-min":25.0,"height-range-max":30.0,"life-span-range-min":12.0,"life-span-range-max":16.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":78,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":46,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":35},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/82ff57cd-9c2b-5c6c-9432-082f5f908513/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/82ff57cd-9c2b-5c6c-9432-082f5f908513/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/82ff57cd-9c2b-5c6c-9432-082f5f908513/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/82ff57cd-9c2b-5c6c-9432-082f5f908513/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/82ff57cd-9c2b-5c6c-9432-082f5f908513/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/82ff57cd-9c2b-5c6c-9432-082f5f908513/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/82ff57cd-9c2b-5c6c-9432-082f5f908513/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/82ff57cd-9c2b-5c6c-9432-082f5f908513/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/82ff57cd-9c2b-5c6c-9432-082f5f908513/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/82ff57cd-9c2b-5c6c-9432-082f5f908513/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/82ff57cd-9c2b-5c6c-9432-082f5f908513/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/82ff57cd-9c2b-5c6c-9432-082f5f908513/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/82ff57cd-9c2b-5c6c-9432-082f5f908513/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/82ff57cd-9c2b-5c6c-9432-082f5f908513/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/82ff57cd-9c2b-5c6c-9432-082f5f908513/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/82ff57cd-9c2b-5c6c-9432-082f5f908513/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/82ff57cd-9c2b-5c6c-9432-082f5f908513/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/82ff57cd-9c2b-5c6c-9432-082f5f908513/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"8328a585-ecf7-588e-8f1f-bf03af9aa30e","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/8328a585-ecf7-588e-8f1f-bf03af9aa30e"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"affenpinscher","name":"Affenpinscher","plural-name":"Affenpinschers ","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"Likely one of the oldest toy breed dogs in the world, the Affenpinscher originated in Germany, where Affenpinscher means \"monkey-like terrier.\" Some breeders reportedly crossed early Affenpinschers with [Pugs](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/pug), [German Pinschers](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/german-pinscher), and others to develop the modern breed.\n\nIn the 1600s, these tiny working dogs raced through horse stables and kitchens to exterminate rats and mice—earning them the nickname \"Ratter\" or \"Ratting Terrier.\" Though the Affen isn't classified as a terrier, they're comparable in both form and temperament.\n\nIt didn't take long for the Affenpinscher's lovable nature to get noticed. The adorable breed soon became a favored pet. And these little pups often led double lives: working dogs by day, devoted household companions at night.\n\nThough Affenpinschers are rare in the United States, they're common in Europe and likely influenced the development of other toy breeds—including the [Miniature Schnauzer](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/schnauzer-miniature) and [Brussels Griffon](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/brussels-griffon).","facts":"Affenpinschers may weigh just 10 lbs. (or less). But they have big personalities. Willful, domineering, entertaining, and affectionate—the Affenpinscher is equal parts loyal companion and fierce protector.","traits-appearance":"The Affenpinscher is a balanced, terrier-like breed with wiry hair that the breed standard describes as \"neat but shaggy\" in appearance. It walks with a light, confident gait.\n\nDue to their somewhat odd appearance, Affenpinschers have been likened to Wookies and Ewoks and given multiple nicknames—including \"ape terrier\" and \"monkey dog.\" The French refer to Affens as \"diablotin moustachu,\" which means \"mustached little devil.\"","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The breed is best known for its dense, rough, wire-haired coat. It's usually about one inch long. But longer hair on the Affen's head, eyebrows, and beard gives the breed a monkey-like expression.\n\nAffenpinschers come in black, gray, silver, red, black and tan, or belge (a black-and-reddish-brown mix). Black coats can have a rusty cast—with white or silver hairs mixed in. The shades of red coats range from red to a tan tinged with orange.","traits-physical":"Though small, Affenpinschers aren't delicate. They're solid, compact dogs that are as long as they are tall—giving them a square appearance. The breed's ears sit high on the head and may be dropped, semi-erect, cropped, or erect. Affens also have a slight underbite and a short muzzle that narrows to a blunt nose.","temperament":"A big dog in a petite package, the Affenpinschers is alert, inquisitive, and feisty. These pups are also loyal and affectionate with their families and fearless in confrontations with strangers.\n\nThough generally quiet, Affens are enthusiastic barkers. They make excellent guard dogs, willing to face down aggressors of all sizes. But these guarding tendencies can sometimes extend to other resources, including food and toys. So, Affenpinschers may not be ideal for families with small children. That said, [socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) can help with this and other undesirable behaviors.","care-nutrition":"To ensure your Affenpinscher doesn't become overweight, measure out meals, and reduce portions if necessary. Affens thrive on a high-quality diet designed for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). You might also consider foods specially formulated for small breeds.","care-grooming":"Regular grooming—including baths—is required to keep Affens looking their best. Brushing with a small brush and metal comb can help remove cast-off hair and mats. And professional groomers can ensure your Affenpinscher keeps its \"monkey-faced\" appearance. (Since Affens have slow-growing hair, you can go a few months between trims.)\n\nTrimming nails, cleaning ears, and [brushing teeth](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) should also be part of your Affenpinscher's grooming routine.","care-exercise":"Affens were bred to work and still require frequent exercise. But a short daily walk, games, or indoor playtime with toys is often enough to wear out this moderately active breed. These tiny athletes may also enjoy participating in dog sports—such as agility, tracking, and both rally and competitive obedience.","care-training":"Affenpinschers have a reputation for being difficult to train due to their stubborn, independent natures. But obedience training is essential. It helps keep your dog's guarding tendencies in check—making them safer around other pets and children.\n\nThese bold, courageous dogs are quick learners and relatively eager to please. They respond best to positive reinforcement and rewards (not harsh reprimands). Affens quickly lose interest during long training sessions. So, opt for shorter, more frequent bouts of obedience training, and switch up activities to keep your pup engaged.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.affenpinscher.org/index.php/the-breed/breed-history\n\nhttps://www.worldcanineassociation.com/affenpinscher\n\nhttps://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/affenpinscher/\n\nhttp://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/Affenpinscher.pdf","reviewed-by":"Laura Inman, DVM","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":2.3,"weight-range-pet-max":6.4,"weight-range-show-min":3.2,"weight-range-show-max":4.1,"height-range-min":23.0,"height-range-max":28.0,"life-span-range-min":12.0,"life-span-range-max":15.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":94,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":57,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":39},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/8328a585-ecf7-588e-8f1f-bf03af9aa30e/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/8328a585-ecf7-588e-8f1f-bf03af9aa30e/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/8328a585-ecf7-588e-8f1f-bf03af9aa30e/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/8328a585-ecf7-588e-8f1f-bf03af9aa30e/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/8328a585-ecf7-588e-8f1f-bf03af9aa30e/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/8328a585-ecf7-588e-8f1f-bf03af9aa30e/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/8328a585-ecf7-588e-8f1f-bf03af9aa30e/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/8328a585-ecf7-588e-8f1f-bf03af9aa30e/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/8328a585-ecf7-588e-8f1f-bf03af9aa30e/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/8328a585-ecf7-588e-8f1f-bf03af9aa30e/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/8328a585-ecf7-588e-8f1f-bf03af9aa30e/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/8328a585-ecf7-588e-8f1f-bf03af9aa30e/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/8328a585-ecf7-588e-8f1f-bf03af9aa30e/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/8328a585-ecf7-588e-8f1f-bf03af9aa30e/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/8328a585-ecf7-588e-8f1f-bf03af9aa30e/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/8328a585-ecf7-588e-8f1f-bf03af9aa30e/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/8328a585-ecf7-588e-8f1f-bf03af9aa30e/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/8328a585-ecf7-588e-8f1f-bf03af9aa30e/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"8403a905-7c5b-546d-8075-b557cc2a8731","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/8403a905-7c5b-546d-8075-b557cc2a8731"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"yorkshire-terrier","name":"Yorkshire Terrier","plural-name":"Yorkshire Terriers","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"Toward the end of the 19th century, Scottish weavers lost work due to the industrial revolution. As they made their way to northern England to find ways to support their families, they brought their dogs along. These dogs likely mixed with Paisley and Clydesdale Terriers to create the first generation of Yorkshire Terriers.\n\nThe breed got its current name in 1870 and arrived in the United States in 1872. The American Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1885. But the Yorkshire Terrier back then was quite different from the breed we have now. To meet the increasing demand for companion dogs, selective breeding reduced the breed's average weight from 30 pounds to less than 10.","facts":"Yorkshire Terriers are very alert, active, and lively. This breed loves to play and doesn't hesitate to protect family and territory—even against much larger dogs. Though Yorkies need lots of attention and companionship, they make excellent pets.","traits-appearance":"Yorkies have long shimmering coats and charming facial expressions. Because of its size, the Yorkshire Terrier is considered a toy breed.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Yorkshire Terriers are a longhaired breed that comes in combinations of black and/or blue (a steel gray color) mixed with tan or more vibrant gold colors. Though uncommon, some have a tiny white chest blaze. Occasionally, the Yorkie's coat can be slow to develop color.","traits-physical":"Yorkies are best known for their lustrous coats. Their silky hair hangs to the floor—straight and even on both sides of its body.","temperament":"Don't let the Yorkshire Terrier's size fool you—it's a fearless, determined, active (and sometimes stubborn) little dog. Yorkies might look like plush toys on the outside, but they are terriers through and through. That means they're lively, loyal, protective, and even bossy on occasion.\n\nYorkies love being with family and crave contact. They're also friendly to children—as long as kids treat them gently. This breed doesn't like to be left alone for long periods. And though they usually get along well with other small dogs, Yorkies may bark when confronted by larger dogs.","care-nutrition":"The Yorkshire Terrier needs high-quality, age-appropriate dog food. All dogs run the risk of obesity if they eat too many calories. So, keep an eye on how much your Yorkie eats and reduce portions if your pup gains weight. Also, remember that giving too many treats in addition to regular meals can lead to weight gain.","care-grooming":"If kept long, the Yorkshire Terrier's coat requires daily brushing. It's best to trim or tie up the hair on the upper part of your Yorkie's head (i.e., the bangs). This prevents it from irritating the eyes. To simplify grooming, some owners opt to clip their Yorkie's coats short.\n\nIn addition to weekly baths, check your dog's ears regularly for any debris, and clean them as needed.","care-exercise":"Yorkshire Terriers need a moderate amount of activity to stay physically and mentally fit. Whether it's taking a walk, chasing after a ball (their favorite pastime), or playing in the yard, there are plenty of ways for Yorkies to get the exercise they need. This breed also enjoys earthdog trials, tracking, flyball, musical freestyle, and obedience.\n\nIf you live in an apartment or small home and don't have room to spare, don't worry. Yorkshire Terriers are an adaptable breed and do fine with limited space for exercise.","care-training":"Yorkies can be stubborn and independent. But you can overcome these tendencies by using reward-based obedience training rather than harsh words.\n\n[Early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) with people and animals is also important.

Though we don't know the breed's exact origins, experts agree it's ancient. Villagers bred these large white dogs to protect sheep from predators—something they still do today.\n\nThe Akbash Dog is considered a landrace breed that mostly remained in the western half of Turkey until the 1960s. David and Judy Nelson brought the first Akbash Dog to the United States in 1978 after falling in love with the breed while on an extended diplomatic assignment. The Nelsons ultimately imported dozens of Akbash, and these dogs became the foundation stock for the American breeding program.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture began using the Akbash as a livestock guardian in the 1980s. Though the breed is now well-known among livestock producers, it has yet to receive American Kennel Club recognition. The United Kennel Club, however, accepted the Akbash in 1998.","facts":"The Akbash Dog is a courageous, quiet, calm breed. These gentle giants make reliable guardians and loyal family companions.","traits-appearance":"The Akbash Dog is a large, lean, muscular dog with an alert and regal appearance. These pups display a mix of Mastiff and gazehound characteristics that breeders have labored to maintain.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Akbash Dogs come in both medium and long coat types. The medium coat lies flat and has a sleek appearance. Long-coated dogs have slightly wavy hair, a distinct ruff, and profuse feathering on the legs and tail.\n\nBoth varieties have a thick double coat composed of a dense undercoat and longer, coarse guard hairs. The coat's thickness varies depending on the climate.\n\nAkbash Dogs always have white coats. But some have light biscuit or gray shading around their ears or in their undercoats.","traits-physical":"Key features of the Akbash Dog include a wedge-shaped head with pendant ears, a deep chest, long legs, and a long tail that curls over the back to show excitement. Males are typically taller and heavier than females, who have a notably feminine appearance.","temperament":"True to their guard dog roots, Akbash Dogs are loyal, brave, and steady. They're also fast enough to chase off predators and independent enough to assess and respond to potential threats without guidance from their people.\n\nDespite their imposing size, Akbash are gentle dogs that make affectionate, calm companions. They get along well with kids and make excellent family pets. But they tend to be suspicious of strangers and may act aggressively when an unknown dog enters their territory. [Early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) helps these pups grow into well-mannered adult dogs.\n\nCompared to many other breeds, Akbash mature slowly, so expect their \"puppy phase\" to continue into adulthood.","care-nutrition":"Akbash thrive on a high-quality diet that's appropriate for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). They also benefit from foods formulated for large breeds—particularly when they're puppies. This helps prevent them from growing too fast and developing hip dysplasia as they age.\n\nBecause of their deep chests, these dogs are at a greater risk of bloat (also known as twisted stomach). To help prevent bloat, break your dog's food up into several meals a day, and use a food bowl designed to slow their eating. Also, avoid feeding immediately before or after any kind of vigorous activity. These are just a few ways you can help prevent this life-threatening condition. Consult your veterinarian about other methods, including surgical options.\n\nTo help your Akbash maintain a healthy weight, keep an eye on their food intake and measure meal portions to avoid overfeeding. Also remember that treats should make up no more than 10% of their daily calories.","care-grooming":"Akbash shed. A lot. Their double coats require weekly brushing to remove loose hair and keep them comfortable. And during spring or early summer—when they blow their coats—daily brushing is best. (Dark pants are not.)\n\nDental disease is one of the most common health conditions in adult dogs. Left untreated, it can lead to other serious issues. So, every pup's grooming routine should include [at-home teeth brushing](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) and professional cleanings.","care-exercise":"Akbash Dogs are not overly active. But they still need daily exercise to remain in good physical and mental shape. Low-intensity walks and backyard games are great ways to get them moving. Because these dogs tend to wander, restrict off-leash outdoor activity to fenced areas only.","care-training":"Akbash Dogs are great guardians due to their independent nature. But this characteristic can also make them challenging to train. Aim to establish yourself as the pack leader early on and use firm, consistent training techniques throughout your dog's life. Because Akbash grow to be over 100 pounds, you'll want to address any behavioral issues during puppyhood so that they don't get out of hand down the road.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.ukcdogs.com/akbash\n\nhttps://www.ukcdogs.com/docs/breeds/akbash-dog.pdf\n\nhttp://www.akbashdogsinternational.com/node/34\n\nhttp://www.akbashdogsinternational.com/node/25\n\nhttps://www.akbashclub.com/companions","reviewed-by":"Jamie Freyer, DVM","date-reviewed":"2021-06-16T16:07:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":32.0,"weight-range-pet-max":64.0,"weight-range-show-min":32.0,"weight-range-show-max":64.0,"height-range-min":69.0,"height-range-max":86.0,"life-span-range-min":10.0,"life-span-range-max":12.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":null,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":null,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":null},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/8403b31f-c4eb-5a56-ae7f-4c39f1033c7d/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/8403b31f-c4eb-5a56-ae7f-4c39f1033c7d/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/8403b31f-c4eb-5a56-ae7f-4c39f1033c7d/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/8403b31f-c4eb-5a56-ae7f-4c39f1033c7d/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/8403b31f-c4eb-5a56-ae7f-4c39f1033c7d/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/8403b31f-c4eb-5a56-ae7f-4c39f1033c7d/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/8403b31f-c4eb-5a56-ae7f-4c39f1033c7d/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/8403b31f-c4eb-5a56-ae7f-4c39f1033c7d/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/8403b31f-c4eb-5a56-ae7f-4c39f1033c7d/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/8403b31f-c4eb-5a56-ae7f-4c39f1033c7d/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/8403b31f-c4eb-5a56-ae7f-4c39f1033c7d/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/8403b31f-c4eb-5a56-ae7f-4c39f1033c7d/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/8403b31f-c4eb-5a56-ae7f-4c39f1033c7d/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/8403b31f-c4eb-5a56-ae7f-4c39f1033c7d/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/8403b31f-c4eb-5a56-ae7f-4c39f1033c7d/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/8403b31f-c4eb-5a56-ae7f-4c39f1033c7d/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/8403b31f-c4eb-5a56-ae7f-4c39f1033c7d/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/8403b31f-c4eb-5a56-ae7f-4c39f1033c7d/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"840ebbed-6062-5e5b-93bb-84edf332e335","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/840ebbed-6062-5e5b-93bb-84edf332e335"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"japanese-spitz","name":"Japanese Spitz","plural-name":"Japanese Spitzes","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"Records lost during World War II make it difficult to know how the Japanese Spitz got its start. The breed—which shares a similar appearance with the [American Eskimo](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/american-eskimo-dog) and [Samoyed](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/samoyed)—might have descended from the German Spitz that arrived in Japan via Siberia and China.\n\nThough first exhibited at a dog show in Tokyo in 1921, the Japanese Kennel Club didn't establish the breed standard until decades later. Japanese Spitz were imported from Canada, the United States, Australia, and China and crossbred to enhance the breed.\n\nBy 1950, these adorable little dogs had developed a significant following, becoming an in-demand breed in their native Japan and around the world.","facts":"Japanese Spitz are smart, affectionate lap dogs that want nothing more than to spend time with their families. Their good-natured, friendly personalities have made these energetic pups popular family pets.","traits-appearance":"Japanese Spitz are intelligent, cheerful, and keen with quick gaits. These small dogs have balanced bodies, pointed muzzles, and alert expressions that make them look fox-like.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Like other spitz-type breeds, the Japanese Spitz has a double coat with a short, soft, dense undercoat and a straight outercoat that stands off of its body. Short hairs cover its face, ears, and parts of its legs. The rest of its body, especially the neck and shoulders, is covered with long hair, giving it the appearance of a mane. The Japanese Spitz has a long tail with profuse feathering. Its coat is pure white.","traits-physical":"Japanese Spitz have pointed muzzles; triangular, pricked ears; small, round, black noses; and large, almond-shaped eyes with black rims. Their overall appearance is dignified and elegant.","temperament":"Japanese Spitz are eager to learn and love to please their families. They've earned a reputation for being natural comedians—and with the permanent grins on their faces, these dogs look like they're always having the time of their lives.\n\nJapanese Spitz prefer being the center of attention in their families. They generally get along well with children and other pets but, due to their small size, require supervision when around small children or big dogs. This breed can be reserved (but never aggressive) with strangers. They love human companionship and would rather spend time with their people than almost anything else.\n\nJapanese Spitz are alert and vigilant. They will bark to sound the alarm if anything seems amiss, but they are not overly vocal dogs and will do fine living in an apartment.","care-nutrition":"Feed Japanese Spitz a high-quality dog food that's appropriate for their age and breed size. To prevent them from becoming overweight, keep an eye on their food intake. Portion out their meals with a measuring cup to avoid over-feeding and limit treats to no more than 10% of their daily calories.","care-grooming":"Expect to brush Japanese Spitz regularly to maintain their coats. This breed sheds its thick undercoat twice a year. During these spring and fall \"shedding seasons,\" they require extra brushing. The rest of the year, weekly brushing is sufficient. Avoid bathing Japanese Spitz too often because it can dry out their skin and strip it of natural (and beneficial) oils.\n\nIn addition to trimming their nails and cleaning their ears, start a regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) routine that includes at-home teeth brushing. Establishing these habits when Japanese Spitz are puppies is part of a lifelong commitment to good dental hygiene.","care-exercise":"One of the many great things about Japanese Spitz is their willingness to adapt to their environments. In apartments, a daily walk will do. But give Japanese Spitz more space, and they will happily roam. Keeping them on a leash in unfenced areas will keep them safe.\n\nThis outgoing breed appreciates interactive games like fetch, trips to the dog park, or other opportunities to be social. They may enjoy activities such as rally, flyball, and musical canine freestyle that take advantage of their natural desire to perform.\n\nJapanese Spitz don't tolerate cold and may not want to spend a lot of time outdoors in chilly climates. These dogs believe that the best part of being active is the nap (preferably with their families) that comes afterward.","care-training":"Japanese Spitz's intelligence and eagerness to please make them an easy breed to train. They respond best to positive reinforcement and reward-based training. But for these pups, the best reward is spending time with their human companions, so look for opportunities for interactive training, such as competitive obedience.\n\nSince Japanese Spitz can be anxious if left alone for long periods, training can help them become more confident. [Socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) is also important for this outgoing breed.

its name implies, the Bolognese comes from Bologna, Italy. This toy breed belongs to the Bichon family and is sometimes called the Bichon Bolognese. Bolos have been popular with aristocratic families since the 11th century.\n\nIn Roman times, Bolognese dogs were popular gifts among those with great wealth and power. For example, King Umberto of Italy gifted a Bolognese to a Belgian princess for her birthday. And Duke Alfonso II d'Este of Ferrara gave a pair of Bolos to King Phillip II of Spain. The list goes on.\n\nOther famous Bolo owners include Catherine the Great of Russia and Marilyn Monroe. And depictions of the breed appear in historical works of art, such as a Flemish tapestry dating back to the 17th century.\n\nDespite this early popularity, the breed fell out of favor and nearly became extinct. But thanks to the efforts of a small group of European breeders, the Bolognese's numbers are up again.","facts":"The Bolognese is a little dog with a lot of fans. A calm breed that requires little exercise, the Bolo makes an easygoing and playful companion. With their long, frizzy white hair, these pups are as adorable as they are affectionate and devoted.","traits-appearance":"The Bolognese is a small, stocky dog with a square build, serene expression, noble carriage, and long, fluffy white coat.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"A long, frizzy (but incredibly soft), white coat gives the Bolo a slightly unkempt appearance. The hair from head to tail is long and stands off the body, whereas the hair on the muzzle is shorter. Under the breed standard, the ideal coat color is pure white. But light shades of ivory are possible.","traits-physical":"The Bolognese is as long as it is tall. The breed has a square build, high set ears that are long and hanging (making its head look oversized), and a long tail carried over the back.","temperament":"Bolognese dogs have calm, easygoing natures. They're affectionate and enjoy spending time with their owners. The strong bond Bolos have with their people make them an excellent breed for retirees or people who stay home most of the time. Bolos are also prone to separation anxiety, so they shouldn't be left alone for long periods. Otherwise, they may become anxious and stressed.\n\nBolognese dogs often get along well with children, provided adults supervise. But keep in mind that young kids may be too excitable when playing with a little dog like the Bolo. Also, this breed sometimes develops small dog syndrome and may not appreciate the enthusiastic affections of little ones.\n\nA calm demeanor makes the Bolognese an excellent traveling companion and well-suited to apartment living. Bolos aren't excessive barkers. Still, they're vigilant dogs and will alert their owners if something is amiss.\n\nThough they are happy, social, and affectionate with their families, Bolognese dogs tend to be shy around strangers. But with [proper socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization), they warm up quickly.","care-nutrition":"Bolos need a high-quality dog food that matches their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). Also, consider a diet specially formulated for small breeds.\n\nExtra calories can add up quickly for a small dog, and that can lead to obesity. To help your Bolognese maintain a healthy weight, monitor their food intake carefully, measure out meals to avoid overfeeding, and limit treats to no more than 10% of their daily calories.","care-grooming":"The Bolognese is a non-shedding breed. But brushing helps remove debris from these dogs' long coats and prevents matting. And occasional baths will keep their coats clean and healthy. Though they don't require haircuts, some people choose to keep their Bolo's coat shorter and leave an untrimmed \"mop\" on top.\n\nTrimming nails, cleaning ears, and [brushing teeth](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) should also be part of your Bolo's grooming routine.","care-exercise":"The Bolognese doesn't require a lot of exercise. A short walk around the block is all it takes to tucker the breed out. Though these dogs might not need much physical activity, they're playful and curious canines. So, they enjoy exploring in a fenced yard, playing games like hide-and-seek, chasing balls, and learning new tricks—especially if it means spending time with their owners.","care-training":"Bolognese dogs are highly intelligent and eager-to-please, which makes them a breeze to train. Obedience training sessions are great opportunities to teach your Bolo the basics—such as come, sit, and stay—while enhancing your bond.\n\nBecause this breed is prone to small dog syndrome, your Bolognese might try to take on the role of pack leader. And such behavior sometimes makes separation anxiety or extreme shyness more likely. Training can help Bolos feel more confident, leading to happier, more well-adjusted dogs.\n\nSince Bolognese dogs tend to be timid around strangers, [early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) is also important. Formal classes provide opportunities for Bolos to interact with other dogs and their owners. Another option for creating positive encounters is to bring this happy-go-lucky breed along on errands or vacations.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/bolognese/\n\nhttp://www.fci.be/Nomenclature/Standards/196g09-en.pdf\n\nhttps://americanbologneseclub.com/bolognese-characteristics","reviewed-by":"Laura

Mastiff","plural-name":"Neapolitan Mastiffs","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The Neapolitan Mastiff is a direct descendent of the great Molossus war dog of antiquity. Evidence of the breed's ancestry dates back to 3000 B.C.\n\nAround 330 B.C., Alexander the Great crossed giant war dogs from Macedonia with shorthaired dogs from India. When the Romans later conquered Greece, they became enamored with the resulting warrior canines. They made the Mastiffs fight men and big game—such as lions, tigers, and elephants—in gladiatorial entertainment.\n\nOver the following centuries, Mastiff breeders in and around Naples developed the breed into a guardian of homes and estates. Owners considered the dog's imposing size and appearance alone enough to deter potential intruders.\n\nThe Neapolitan Mastiff arrived in America by the 1970s and received American Kennel Club recognition in 2004.","facts":"The Neapolitan Mastiff is an intelligent, calm breed that's loving and devoted to its family. These big dogs are good around children and other pets with proper socialization and training. Neapolitan Mastiffs certainly have an imposing size and appearance. But as their owners will attest, they're really sweet-tempered softies underneath.","traits-appearance":"Hailing back to the days of ancient Rome, the Neapolitan Mastiff's colossal and commanding appearance has astonished invaders and intruders alike. The breed is tough and stately looking, as well as powerful and solidly built. The Neapolitan Mastiff has a classic guard dog exterior but is docile and non-aggressive on the inside.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Neapolitan Mastiff comes in blue (gray), black, mahogany, and tawny. Lighter and darker shades of these colors may exist in the breed. Reverse brindle (tan stripes) and white markings on the chest and underbody are also possible.","traits-physical":"Neapolitan Mastiffs are recognizable by their immense, stocky body, and loose skin. An abundance of wrinkles and folds hang from the face, muzzle, and nose of the Neapolitan Mastiff. Long ears flank their heads.","temperament":"It's not unusual for the Neapolitan Mastiff to be stubborn, determined, and strong-willed with a mind of its own. That said, Neapolitan Mastiffs are loyal and peaceful dogs, making them excellent family pets.\n\nDue to their size, they require careful supervision around children. Because of the breed's extreme devotion to its home and territory, it makes a superior guardian. For the same reason, these dogs rarely wander or stray from home.\n\nThe Neapolitan Mastiff may not get along well with other dogs. Their size may be intimidating, which can lead to aggression or fighting. To help your pup develop into a well-mannered dog, [begin socialization at a young age](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization).","care-nutrition":"All dogs need high-quality food that's appropriate for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). A diet formulated specifically for large-breed dogs is best for Neapolitan Mastiffs, as it supports slow and steady growth.\n\nMonitor how much food your Neapolitan Mastiff eats. To keep them at a healthy weight, measure food portions and consider treats when tracking their daily calorie intake. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of your dog's calories.","care-grooming":"The short coat of the Neapolitan Mastiff is fairly low maintenance. A bath from time to time should do the trick.\n\nThe breed's eyes and ears should be checked and gently cleaned whenever needed, and the nails should get regular trims to keep them at a short length. Note that Neapolitan Mastiffs are wont to drool—so be prepared!","care-exercise":"The exercise needs of the Neapolitan Mastiff are generally low. A short walk—say 15-30 minutes daily—is usually sufficient. Leisurely hikes and brief games of catch or chase are also great options.","care-training":"Though stubborn, Neapolitan Mastiffs respond well to reward-based training techniques. The breed thrives on praise and positive reinforcement.\n\nNeapolitan Mastiffs are not the best breed for a novice pet owner due to their attention and disciplinary needs. But if you have experience handling dominant alpha dogs, it could be a perfect fit.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/neapolitan-mastiff/\n\nhttps://www.google.com/books/edition/Neapolitan_Mastiff/CLwKBgAAQBAJ","reviewed-by":"Cindy Elston, DVM,

Pointing Griffon","plural-name":"Wirehaired Pointing Griffons","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The Wirehaired Pointing Griffon originated in Holland in the late 19th century. Eduard Korthals—a Dutch sportsman and breeder who studied canine genetics—wanted to create the ultimate walking hunter's gundog.\n\nKorthals owned many different dogs and carefully planned his breeding program. He wanted a breed that could hunt a variety of game on all types of terrain. So, he selected dogs with high strength and endurance, talented noses, water-repellent coats, and cooperative natures. The result was a robust dog that had all the characteristics of an exceptional pointer and retriever.\n\nKorthals continued his breeding program when he moved to Germany, and eventually France. The breed standard was established in 1886, and the Wirehaired Pointing Griffon quickly gained popularity throughout Europe. The breed earned AKC recognition in 1887, though it was mistakenly labeled a Russian Setter. Today, most Wirehaired Pointing Griffons are still bred in France.","facts":"The Wirehaired Pointing Griffon is an intelligent, active, and affectionate breed. With excellent hunting, pointing, and retrieving skills, Griffons make supreme gundogs. But these pups can be exceptional family dogs, too.","traits-appearance":"The Wirehaired Pointing Griffon is a medium-sized dog with a square-shaped head and catlike gracefulness.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Wirehaired Pointing Griffon's functional coat is one of its most distinguishing features. The outer coat is straight and wiry with a harsh texture that protects the breed when hunting in rough terrain. The undercoat is thick, insulating, and water-repellent.\n\nWirehaired Pointing Griffons come in steel gray with brown markings—which vary from shades of chestnut to white and orange. Ticking and roan are also common.","traits-physical":"The Wirehaired Pointing Griffon is famous for its facial furnishings. These extensions of its undercoat create prominent eyebrows and a mustache—giving the Griffon a somewhat unkempt appearance and friendly expression. Large, slightly rounded eyes that range from dark yellow to brown contribute to the breed's casual look.","temperament":"Wirehaired Pointing Griffons are intelligent, energetic dogs with outgoing personalities that make them a fun breed for active families. They're very loyal to their people and gentle and loving with kids. All that said, they can be nervous around strangers.\n\nThis breed loves outdoor activities. But Griffons are also happy to curl up on the couch for a nap when they return home.","care-nutrition":"Wirehaired Pointing Griffons require a high-quality dog food that is age-appropriate—whether it's commercially manufactured or homemade (with a veterinarian's supervision and approval).\n\nTo keep your Wirehaired Pointing Griffon healthy, it's important to monitor how much they eat. Avoid accidental overfeeding by measuring out meals. And reduce portions or restrict calories if your pup gains weight. Also, remember that giving too many treats can contribute to obesity. Treats should make up no more than 10% of a dog's calories.","care-grooming":"Brushing or combing your Wirehaired Pointing Griffon's coat weekly will keep it looking its best. As necessary, use scissors to trim around your pup's feet or ears. But never use clippers on the body, or the wiry hair will grow back much fuzzier.\n\nBecause of their longer ears, Griffons may be more prone to ear infections. Inspect and clean ears routinely to prevent infections. You should also trim nails regularly to keep them at a short, tidy length. Nails that get too long can cause discomfort and lead to problems walking.\n\nFinally, maintaining good [dental hygiene](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) is essential for any dog's long-term health. In addition to scheduling professional dental cleanings, establish an at-home care routine that includes regular (ideally daily) teeth brushing.","care-exercise":"Like other sporting breeds, Wirehaired Pointing Griffons need daily exercise. Games of fetch in a fenced backyard, hiking, and swimming are all activities Griffons enjoy. They also like dog sports—such as tracking, hunting, field trials, agility, and obedience. And if you're looking for a jogging buddy, the Griffon will happily oblige.","care-training":"Intelligent and eager to please, Wirehaired Pointing Griffons tend to be relatively easy to train. Consistent and positive training programs work best for this breed.\n\nIt's also wise to [socialize your Griffon puppy](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) to help them grow into a well-mannered adult dog.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.awpga.com\n\nhttps://www.akc.org/expert-advice/lifestyle/5-things-you-didnt-know/\n\nhttps://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/wirehaired-pointing-griffon/\n\nhttp://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/WirehairedPointingGriffon.pdf\n\nhttp://www.fci.be/Nomenclature/Standards/107g07-en.pdf","reviewed-by":"Annette Louviere, DVM","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":18.1,"weight-range-pet-max":30.4,"weight-range-show-min":20.0,"weight-range-show-max":24.9,"height-range-min":51.0,"height-range-max":61.0,"life-span-range-min":10.0,"life-span-range-max":15.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":92,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":55,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":37},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/874e9fcc-9eaf-556a-8fff-9030e6330c81/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/874e9fcc-9eaf-556a-8fff-9030e6330c81/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/874e9fcc-9eaf-556a-8fff-9030e6330c81/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/874e9fcc-9eaf-556a-8fff-9030e6330c81/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/874e9fcc-9eaf-556a-8fff-9030e6330c81/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/874e9fcc-9eaf-556a-8fff-9030e6330c81/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/874e9fcc-9eaf-556a-8fff-9030e6330c81/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/874e9fcc-9eaf-556a-8fff-9030e6330c81/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/874e9fcc-9eaf-556a-8fff-9030e6330c81/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/874e9fcc-9eaf-556a-8fff-9030e6330c81/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/874e9fcc-9eaf-556a-8fff-9030e6330c81/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/874e9fcc-9eaf-556a-8fff-9030e6330c81/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/874e9fcc-9eaf-556a-8fff-9030e6330c81/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/874e9fcc-9eaf-556a-8fff-9030e6330c81/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/874e9fcc-9eaf-556a-8fff-9030e6330c81/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/874e9fcc-9eaf-556a-8fff-9030e6330c81/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/874e9fcc-9eaf-556a-8fff-9030e6330c81/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/874e9fcc-9eaf-556a-8fff-9030e6330c81/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"87d76ac0-7e2b-59fe-aca0-70ec5c8b5942","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/87d76ac0-7e2b-59fe-aca0-70ec5c8b5942"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"kishu-ken","name":"Kishu Ken","plural-name":"Kishu Kens","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"Hailing from Japan, the Kishu Ken (also called Kumano Ken and Taichi Ke) likely descended from [wolves](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/gray-wolf) and a mix of spitz-type hunting dogs. The breed is similar to the [Hokkaido](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/hokkaido-inu), [Shikoku Ken](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/shikoku-ken), and [Kai Ken](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/kai-ken).\n\nThough the Kishu Ken is a medium-sized breed, these dogs have hunted larger prey—including wild boar and deer. Hunters favored the dogs with white coats because they were easier to spot in the woods. The Kishu Ken comes from ancient breeds. But the breed itself has been around for less than a century. Its strength and endurance made the Kishu Ken popular in Japan, where it's still among the most common breeds used for boar hunting. But these dogs are rare elsewhere.\n\nKishu Ken numbers remain small and have declined in recent years, making the breed's future uncertain. The Japanese declared the Kishu Ken a Memorial of Nature (protected species) in 1934.","facts":"A hunting dog that originated in the mountainous region of Kishu, Japan, the Kishu Ken is an active and faithful companion. These pups are known for being calm and affectionate. But they retain their strong predatory instincts—which often kick in around small animals.","traits-appearance":"The Kishu Ken is a medium-sized dog with upright, pricked ears, a curled tail, and a narrow muzzle. It is a strong, muscular breed.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The earliest Kishu Kens had white coats with various colored markings. But the newer breed standard introduced in 1934 allows for only a solid color: white, red, or sesame.\n\nLike many Japanese hunting breeds, the Kishu Ken has a double-coat, with a soft and dense undercoat and coarse, straight outer coat. The hair on the dog's cheeks and tail is longer than that on other parts of the body.","traits-physical":"Kishu Kens have triangular-shaped eyes that turn slightly upward at the outer corners.","temperament":"The Kishu Ken is energetic, obedient, devoted, and good-natured. These dogs make excellent companions for those with active lifestyles. They'll happily tag along on hikes or hunting trips before curling up for a good rest. Kishu Kens are devoted to their packs and develop strong bonds with their people, but they may seem aloof around strangers.\n\nBoth affectionate and independent, Kishu Kens can be good with children. But their strong predatory instincts may make them unpredictable around other dogs and aggressive toward smaller animals. A strong-willed breed, Kishu Kens aren't the best option for inexperienced owners.","care-nutrition":"Kishu Kens require a high-quality dog food that's age-appropriate—whether it's commercially manufactured or homemade (with a veterinarian's supervision and approval). A nutrient-dense food that helps this active breed maintain its weight may also be necessary.","care-grooming":"When it comes to grooming, Kishu Kens are low-maintenance. Regular brushing and an occasional bath will keep them looking their best. Their fast-growing nails will also need regular trims.\n\nAnd keep in mind that [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care)—including at-home teeth brushing—is essential to the overall health of all dogs, regardless of breed.","care-exercise":"Kishu Kens want to go, go, go. So they're best-suited for owners with very active lifestyles. Bred to run and hunt, Kishu Kens enjoy hiking, camping, swimming, and endurance activities—including flyball, rally, herding, and lure coursing. Daily walks will rarely be enough to burn off their intense energy. Since this breed can be reactive to other dogs, the dog park is not the best place to take a Kishu Ken for exercise.\n\nHighly intelligent, Kishu Kens get bored easily. So, mix things up by exploring new trails, taking different routes around the neighborhood, and introducing fresh games and toys to keep them stimulated. Bored, under-exercised Kishu Kens often get into trouble or try to run away.","care-training":"Kishu Kens are calm, alert, and intelligent. As a result, they learn fast. But that doesn't mean the breed is easy to train. Strong hunting instincts can make it hard for Kishu Kens to focus on their owners instead of the environment.\n\nStart training early and focus on developing a bond. Using a prized treat or toy as a reward will likely reduce this breed's resistance to training. And high-energy, active games will help you hold your Kishu Ken's attention.\n\nA natural suspicion of strangers and unfamiliar dogs makes [early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) crucial for Kishu Kens, as it minimizes nervous or reactive behaviors.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/kishu-ken/\n\nhttp://www.kishuclub.com/history.html\n\nhttp://www.fci.be/Nomenclature/Standards/318g05-en.pdf","reviewed-by":"Cindy

on Phu Quoc island off the coast of southwest Vietnam. It is the most well known of the four native breeds of Vietnam. These dogs lived alongside native islanders and served as hunting dogs and guardians. They were usually used for scent tracking over short distances in the jungle, often in packs of 3 to 6 dogs. These dogs were often required to hunt for themselves to supplement their sparse diet, so by necessity they are skillful jumpers, swimmers, and climbers.\n\nOriginally, several regional variations with differing sizes existed, isolated by the difficult jungle terrain. In the late 1800s, several French colonists took note of the breed and brought Phu Quoc Ridgebacks back to Europe—the breed's first known departure from the island. They are still quite rare today, even in Vietnam.\n\nThe Vietnam Kennel Association created the first breed standard based on descriptions from French breeders and extensive historical research. Today, the Phu Quoc Ridgeback Association works to refine that standard and preserve the breed, which is in danger of extinction due to rarity and outcrossing.","facts":"The Phu Quoc is an alert, loyal breed with a sweet disposition and regal appearance.","traits-appearance":"The Phu Quoc is one of only three breeds with a ridgeback (the others being the [Thai Ridgeback](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/thai-ridgeback) and [Rhodesian Ridgeback](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/rhodesian-ridgeback). Additionally, this medium-sized dog has a square, powerful body built for speed and endurance.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"This breed has a short, fine single-layer coat. It comes in black, fawn, brindle, and black and tan. Chocolate coats are possible but not preferred in the breed standard. Some have urajiro (light undersides) or black masks. White spotting can occur but is frowned upon, as it’s not good camouflage in the jungle.","traits-physical":"The Phu Quoc's most notable feature is the symmetrical ridge that covers at least 2/3 of its back. Additionally, this breed has a narrow head, expressive almond-shaped eyes, pricked ears, and a long, lean neck. The tail is upright, medium-length and arched like a sickle. ","temperament":"The Phu Quoc is a brave, noble dog that's loyal and loving toward its people. Though generally friendly, they can be cautious around strangers. This energetic breed likes to swim, run, and play, making them a great fit for active families. A tall, fenced yard is best for these pups (who are excellent at jumping and climbing trees).","care-nutrition":"This breed thrives on high-quality dog food appropriate for their age, size, and activity level. To help them maintain their lean appearance, measure their meals to avoid overfeeding and keep treats to 10% or less of their daily calories.","care-grooming":"The Phu Quoc's short coat sheds minimally, though heavier seasonal shedding periods do occur. They don't require daily brushing and need only an occasional bath to keep them looking their best. Additionally, ear checks, nail trims, and [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) should be part of their grooming routine.","care-exercise":"Phu Quocs need daily exercise to keep them physically and mentally fit. Brisk walks, jogs, and trips to the lake for a swim are great ways to keep them active. They are also well-suited for dog sports such as agility and flyball. ","care-training":"These intelligent, even-tempered dogs respond well to consistent training with plenty of positive reinforcement. Additionally, all dogs benefit from [early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization). Helping them feel comfortable with different people and environments when they're young will help them grow into well-adjusted adult

Terrier","plural-name":"Australian Terriers","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The Australian Terrier likely hails from the breeding of many terrier breeds, namely the Yorkshire, Scottie, Norwich, Skye, Cairn, and Dandie Dinmont terriers. The breed came about to act as fearless exterminators of snakes and other small mammals.\n\nWhen British settlers arrived in Australia in the 19th century, they brought their dogs with them. Lonely and removed, these settlers and their dogs came to rely on each other for company. As it turned out, this particular breed was just as ready to cuddle as they were to spend long, hard days at work.\n\nDespite its British roots, the Terrier is Australian through and through. It was the first native breed to receive official recognition there—it was also the first Australian breed to be recognized outside of the country too. The American Kennel Club registered the breed in 1960.","facts":"The Australian Terrier makes a delightful family pet. Highly loyal, they’re dedicated to—and demand a lot of attention from—their people.","traits-appearance":"The Australian Terrier may be small in stature, but they offer boundless energy and companionship.\n\nThe breed has distinct coat furnishings around their forequarters and neck, and the plume of soft and silky hair on the top of their head is different in texture from the rest of their coat. Their dark eyes give you a glimpse into their playful personality.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Australian Terrier has a harsh and straight weatherproof outer coat with a short and soft undercoat. Australian Terrier’s coats are usually blue and tan, solid sandy, or solid red.\n\nTheir “topknot,” or the soft and silky plume of hair at the top of their head, is made of finer and softer hair than the rest of their coat.","traits-physical":"The Australian Shepherd is a small and sturdy bread with pricked ears and a short tail. The “topknot” found at the top of their head is soft and silky, in contrast to the rest of their harsh coat.","temperament":"The Australian Terrier is loyal and loving, a friend to both young kids and older people. They can be bossy and demanding, so proper [socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) is important. In general, though, Australian Terriers are lively and energetic, ready to play with their people, and then cuddle on the couch when playtime is over.","care-nutrition":"The Australian Terrier is an active breed that does best with high-quality dog food that’s suited to their particular age, as well as any additional health concerns.\n\nAs with any dog, it’s important to monitor the amount of food and treats that you give your Australian Terrier, especially since some dogs may be prone to gaining weight as they age. Your veterinarian is always a good source to help provide you with appropriate nutrition and feeding guidelines.","care-grooming":"This breed has a harsh and weatherproof outer coat that repels dirt well, so it’s relatively easy to maintain. A once a week brushing with a brush or grooming mitt should help keep it in shape. This particular breed can also have long hairs that grow adjacent to the eyes, which can irritate the eyes if left unmanaged. Usually, the hairs can be easily plucked while grooming.\n\nAll dogs require regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care), including at-home teeth brushing and professional dental cleanings, and the Australian Terrier is no exception. Maintaining good dental hygiene is important for their overall long-term health.","care-exercise":"Like most terriers, the Australian Terrier is a high-energy, active breed that requires a lot of regular exercise. When left without ways to burn off their energy, they may turn to undesirable habits, like digging.\n\nLuckily, these dogs love spending time with their people, so activities like walks or playing fetch (in a fenced area) work well. Because the Australian Terrier has a strong urge to hunt, they should always be leashed or in a secure area when outside.","care-training":"Although Australian Terriers can be stubborn, they love their people, so training is just another way for you to spend time together. They do tend to get bored easily, so it’s best to keep the sessions short.\n\nWithout proper training and [socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization), Australian Terriers can develop some undesirable habits, like digging. They can also be bossy and territorial, and it may be difficult for them to share a home with other animals.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.australianterrier.org/characteristics\n\nhttps://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/australian-terrier/\n\nhttp://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/AustralianTerrier.pdf","reviewed-by":"Annette

Retriever","plural-name":"Flat-Coated Retrievers","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The Flat-Coated Retriever, bred in 19th-century England, is one of the oldest retriever breeds. Their origins likely come from Newfoundland Wavy-Coated Retrievers that were imported and then crossed with Setters.\n\nA breeder named J. Hull established the first Flat-Coated Retriever breeding program in 1864. At that time, shooting birds in flight—rather than on the ground or a perch—was growing more popular. And hunters needed a dog that could retrieve dead and wounded birds from the water.\n\nFlat-Coats turned out to be a natural gundog both in and out of the water. In fact, from roughly 1890 until the first World War, they had such an excellent reputation that they were the most popular retriever in Britain. However, due in part to the rising popularity of [Labradors](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/labrador-retriever) and [Golden Retrievers](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/golden-retriever), the breed's popularity fell dramatically by the end of World War II.\n\nThe Flat-Coated Retriever gained AKC recognition in 1915.","facts":"The Flat-Coated Retriever is a very intelligent breed. Good-natured, energetic, active, and eager to please, these retrievers make versatile working dogs and loving family members. Flat-Coats display their cheerful, outgoing attitude through their happily wagging tails.","traits-appearance":"The Flat-Coated Retriever has a happy, active demeanor, intelligent expression, and clean lines. In silhouette, the Flat-Coat has a long, strong, clean, \"one-piece\" head—the breed's most distinctive feature.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Flat-Coated Retriever's straight, flat-lying coat may be slightly wavy. Moderately dense, it protects from water, weather, and ground cover when the dog is working.\n\nFlat-Coats have thick feathering on their ears, fronts, chests, backs of forelegs, thighs, and undersides of their tails. Often they also have a mane of longer, heavier hair on their necks. The breed's coat comes in solid black or solid liver. A yellow coat is possible but falls outside the breed standard.","traits-physical":"The Flat-Coat's trademark \"one-piece\" head features a fairly flat skull, clean cheeks, and long, strong, deep muzzle. This breed's relatively small ears are covered in thick feathering and lie close to the head. Flat-Coats have an alert, intelligent, and kind expression. Their almond-shaped eyes are set widely apart and are dark brown or hazel.","temperament":"Flat-Coated Retrievers love their families and enjoy spending time with their favorite humans. They need to receive a lot of attention to be happy. Including them in your outdoor adventures and making them a part of everyday family life are the best ways to help these energetic dogs thrive.\n\nThis breed is slow to mature. So, rambunctious, puppy-like behavior continues well into adult years. In fact, some owners say Flat-Coats never lose their light-hearted, youthful ways.\n\nFlat-Coated Retrievers are friendly with other dogs and pets but may seem reserved around people they don't know.","care-nutrition":"Flat-Coated Retrievers need high-quality food that's appropriate for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior) and activity level. To prevent them from becoming overweight or obese, keep an eye on their food intake. And don't forget to account for treats in their overall calorie intake. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of their daily calories.","care-grooming":"Flat-Coated Retrievers are above average-shedders. Weekly brushing with a metal dog comb will help remove loose hair and keep their coats clean.\n\nThough nails will wear down during regular activity, they'll likely need routine trimming to keep them at an ideal length. Overgrown nails can cause pain and may eventually lead to problems walking.\n\nMaintaining good [dental hygiene](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) is essential for any dog's long-term health. In addition to professional dental cleanings, establish an at-home care routine that includes regular teeth brushing.","care-exercise":"Like most breeds in the sporting group, Flat-Coated Retrievers need a lot of daily exercise. Luckily, they are up for just about any activity, including long hikes, running, or backyard games of fetch.\n\nThey also enjoy dog sports such as flyball, frisbee, hunt and field trials, agility, tracking, and both rally and competitive obedience. These activities both give your Flat-Coat a needed outlet for their physical energy and provide mental stimulation.","care-training":"Flat-Coated Retrievers are responsive and eager to please, so they are generally easy to train. Due to their sensitive nature, they respond best to gentle techniques and positive reinforcement.\n\nTrue to their heritage, Flat-Coats are known to retrieve items from around the house or yard. It's not uncommon for them to bring back shoes, a child's stuffed animal, or other household items. Fortunately, they are also very food-motivated, which can be helpful when training them to release items that they've retrieved. Simply offer a favorite treat in exchange for whatever it is that they have in their possession.\n\nFinally, [early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) will help Flat-Coated Retrievers develop into well-mannered adult dogs.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/lifestyle/facts-about-flat-coated-retriever/\n\nhttps://fcrsa.org/breed-standard/\n\nhttps://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/flat-coated-retriever/","reviewed-by":"Annette Louviere, DVM","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":23.1,"weight-range-pet-max":39.5,"weight-range-show-min":24.9,"weight-range-show-max":36.3,"height-range-min":56.0,"height-range-max":58.0,"life-span-range-min":8.0,"life-span-range-max":13.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":101,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":65,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":43},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/89798c78-e357-55d7-960b-6260a66f7d01/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/89798c78-e357-55d7-960b-6260a66f7d01/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/89798c78-e357-55d7-960b-6260a66f7d01/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/89798c78-e357-55d7-960b-6260a66f7d01/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/89798c78-e357-55d7-960b-6260a66f7d01/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/89798c78-e357-55d7-960b-6260a66f7d01/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/89798c78-e357-55d7-960b-6260a66f7d01/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/89798c78-e357-55d7-960b-6260a66f7d01/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/89798c78-e357-55d7-960b-6260a66f7d01/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/89798c78-e357-55d7-960b-6260a66f7d01/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/89798c78-e357-55d7-960b-6260a66f7d01/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/89798c78-e357-55d7-960b-6260a66f7d01/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/89798c78-e357-55d7-960b-6260a66f7d01/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/89798c78-e357-55d7-960b-6260a66f7d01/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/89798c78-e357-55d7-960b-6260a66f7d01/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/89798c78-e357-55d7-960b-6260a66f7d01/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/89798c78-e357-55d7-960b-6260a66f7d01/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/89798c78-e357-55d7-960b-6260a66f7d01/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"897bc9ca-a239-5e35-a860-c460507fa1ce","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/897bc9ca-a239-5e35-a860-c460507fa1ce"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"weimaraner","name":"Weimaraner","plural-name":"Weimaraners","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"German nobles of the Court of Weimar developed the Weimaraner. Though no one knows exactly when this happened, many suspect the breed's history dates back to the 17th century. Regardless, the current breed standards didn't come about until the 1800s.\n\nWeimaraners originally hunted big game—such as wolves, wildcats, cougars, and bears. Their stealthy, cat-like hunting style (and coat color) earned them the nickname \"Gray Ghost.\"  As Europe's populations of large predators declined, the breed found a new job pointing and retrieving game birds.\n\nWhen developing the breed, German nobles tightly controlled its availability and allowed only those with high status to have the dogs. In the 1920s, the German government finally permitted a pair of Weimaraners to come to America.\n\nThe American Kennel Club first recognized the Weimaraner in 1943. It's since become very popular as a sportsman's dog and family pet. Weimaraners have also begun to serve as police dogs, rescue dogs, and therapy dogs.","facts":"The Weimaraner is an energetic, alert, and powerful breed. Large and loyal, these dogs are happy to work or play all day—as long as they have their favorite human by their side.","traits-appearance":"The Weimaraner's aristocratic features suggest grace, alertness, and balance. A medium-to-large breed, the Weimaraner has a sinewy, muscular body built for endurance and speed.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"A defining feature, the Weimaraner's sleek, short coat comes in a variety of silvers, from mouse gray to silver gray. A small patch of white on the chest and lighter shading around the muzzle and head are possible.","traits-physical":"Weimaraners' ears are long and slightly folded. Their amber, gray, or blue-gray eyes offer an intelligent expression. Male Weimaraners have broader skulls and more angular muzzles than females.","temperament":"The Weimaraner is an active, loving, intelligent breed that adores being around people. These dogs don't do well when left alone for long periods. So, they're best suited for a home where they'll get plenty of attention and companionship.\n\nWeims are very affectionate towards their family. They're also brave and competent guard dogs that alert their people—usually with a friendly bark—if something grabs their attention. Because of their exuberance, you should closely supervise your Weimaraner when they're around other dogs or children.\n\nAll the skills that make Weimaraners great hunting companions can also make them a nuisance to small pets and wildlife. They may chase or hunt other animals (including cats), and they tend to bark.","care-nutrition":"Weimaraners need to eat high-quality food that's appropriate for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). A diet formulated specifically for large-breed dogs is a good option to consider.\n\nAll dogs are at risk for obesity if they overeat. And if there's one thing Weimaraners like to do, it's eat. To keep your pup at a healthy weight, monitor food portions, and cut back if they start to gain weight. And be sure to take treats into account when tracking their daily calorie intake. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of a dog's calories.\n\nAlso important to know: Weimaraners don't always limit the things they eat to food. For some dogs, rocks are a favorite snack. But eating rocks is harmful and, in some cases, can be deadly. So, keep an eye on your pup and immediately remove any non-food items they try to eat.\n\nFinally, Weimaraners are more prone than other breeds to bloat (also known as twisted stomach). To help prevent bloat, break your dog's food up into several daily meals, and use a food bowl designed to slow their rate of eating. Avoid feeding them immediately before or after any kind of vigorous activity. These are just a few ways you can help prevent this life-threatening condition. Ask your veterinarian about other methods, including surgical options, for preventing bloat.","care-grooming":"Grooming a Weimaraner is a relatively low-maintenance job. Just brush your pup once a week to remove any loose or dead hair, and clip their nails regularly to prevent them from getting too long. (Overgrown nails can cause discomfort or lead to issues walking.)\n\nBecause of their long ears, Weimaraners may be more prone to ear infections than other breeds. So, as part of the grooming routine, also check and clean your dog's ears routinely to prevent infections.\n\nDogs need dental care, too—both professional and at-home dental care that includes daily teeth brushing. Maintaining good [dental hygiene](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) is essential for your Weim's overall long-term health.","care-exercise":"Weimaraners are not short on energy. As such, this breed requires a lot of physical activity. But when properly exercised, Weims are happy to relax on the couch alongside their favorite people.\n\nLong runs, vigorous backyard play sessions, swimming, hiking, and retrieving games are great ways for a Weimaraner to burn energy.

This dog had ideal characteristics of both species, and was subsequently selectively bred to additional German Shepherd Dogs to create a stable breed.\n\nRecent genetic studies have suggested that although the Lupo Italiano is indeed a cohesive breed, it has little surviving evidence of wolf ancestry. In 1988, the Italian Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry officially recognized the Lupo Italiano, and since its inception, the breed cannot be sold. Those who want a dog must apply for one, demonstrating that they will continue to train, use, and breed the Lupo responsibly in cooperation with the official registry. \n\nDue to their stamina, intelligence, and keen senses—as well as their ability to perform in rough terrain and snow—these dogs are often used for search and rescue. Additionally, Italian forest rangers often use Lupi Italiani as patrol and hunting dogs. They have also been successfully employed as therapy dogs.\n\nSince 2012, the Association of the Affidatari del Lupo Italiano or AAALI exclusively manages the responsible breeding and distribution of the Lupo Italiano.

These pups bond closely with their human family members but are often wary of strangers. Their strength, bravery, and temperament make them well-suited as working or herding dogs. ","care-nutrition":"This breed thrives on high-quality dog food appropriate for their age, size, and activity level. In particular, puppies may benefit from a large-breed growth diet. These specially formulated diets help prevent large breed dogs from growing too fast, which may decrease the likelihood or severity of hip dysplasia as they age. To help them maintain a healthy weight, measure their meals to avoid overfeeding and keep treats to 10% or less of their daily calories.","care-grooming":"The Lupo Italiano's thick double coat requires frequent brushing to remove loose fur and dirt. Additionally, regular nail trims and [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) should be part of their grooming routine.","care-exercise":"This breed has a lot of energy and stamina.

But by the 20th century, breeders had begun crossing these foxhounds with other dogs to yield proficient raccoon hunters. These first American English Coonhounds would chase raccoons up trees and then help their owners spot them in the branches.\n\nToday, the American English Coonhound is considered one of the fastest Coonhound breeds—a strong and agile hunter that’s as pleasant and sociable as it is energetic and confident. As with any breed that’s inclined to hunt, American English Coonhounds should never be let off-leash in a free environment. Once prey is in their line of sight, it’s next to impossible to get them to give it up.","facts":"Originally bred for hunting, American English Coonhounds are energetic dogs that make wonderful pets. They react well to reward-based training, and their good-natured and sociable attitude also makes them an excellent breed for families with kids or other animals.","traits-appearance":"The American English Coonhound has a muscular, athletic body that’s both poised and graceful.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"American English Coonhounds come in a variety of colors, including black, black and tan, blue, brown, red, red and white, and tri-colored. Their short- to medium-length coat has a ticked marking.","traits-physical":"Known for their strong and racy bodies, American English Coonhounds have deep chests and strong backs. Their bodies—which stand as high as 26 inches at the shoulder—are perfectly balanced, with no overly exaggerated parts. And their broad heads are flanked with low-hung ears.","temperament":"The energetic drive that makes American English Coonhounds amazing hunters can also make them challenging dogs for novice owners. With a little patience and proper training and [socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization), however, this breed can be calm and friendly when not in pursuit of its furry prey.\n\nAmerican English Coonhounds do best when they have enough space to run around, explore, and play. With their energy handled appropriately, they can be sweet and docile, ready to interact with people and other animals, alike.\n\nTheir loud barking makes them great watchdogs—even if, in the end, they’re more likely to lick an intruder than scare them away.","care-nutrition":"The American English Coonhound is an active breed that does best when fed a high-quality dog food that’s suited to their particular age, as well as any additional health concerns.\n\nAs with any dog, it’s important to monitor the amount of food and treats that you give your American English Coonhound, especially since they are prone to gaining weight as they age. Your veterinarian is always a good source to help provide you with appropriate nutrition and feeding guidelines.","care-grooming":"The American English Coonhound has a short- to medium-length coat that requires little care. Weekly brushing with a shedding tool or grooming mitt can help keep stray hairs at bay and reduce shedding. Proper brushing also helps keep your dog’s coat shiny by properly distributing healthy oils. The American English Coonhound also has floppy ears that should be cleaned and checked weekly.\n\nAll dogs require regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care), including at-home teeth brushing and professional dental cleanings, and American English Coonhounds are no exception. Maintaining good dental hygiene is important for their overall long-term health.","care-exercise":"This high-energy breed needs plenty of exercise to stay healthy and happy. Therefore, living in a small apartment with no backyard space to run around in will likely not make them very happy. Taking your American English Coonhound with you for a run, swim, or hike are all excellent ways to provide them with the exercise they need.\n\nIf long-distance activities aren’t accessible, even a quick game of chase, tug-of-war, or fetch will suffice. Another activity that helps them thrive is competitive [obedience training](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-obedience-training), which not only reinforces desired behaviors but also provides them with mental exercise.","care-training":"Without the proper training, American English Coonhounds can become possessive over items like food, so early socialization and training are key. A traditional hound, the American English Coonhound is both sweet and docile but also harbors a tendency for stubbornness.\n\nSo, patience is key when attempting to train your American English Coonhound. Additionally, reward-based training is the best way to help this intelligent breed learn quickly.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.westminsterkennelclub.org/breeds/american-english-coonhound\n\nhttps://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/american-english-coonhound/","reviewed-by":"Laura

experts believe the Mongolian street dog is a direct descendant of those earliest \"dogs.\" Unlike purebred dogs that people have developed to strengthen certain traits, Mongolian street dogs don't belong to a particular breed.\n\nMost dogs in Mongolia today fall into two categories: working dogs and feral dogs. People use working dogs for herding and guarding but don't generally consider them companions. Feral dogs, on the other hand, wander the streets and are often considered a nuisance. Because there are no animal shelters and few spay and neuter programs in Mongolia, many of these free-roaming dogs exist.","facts":"Mongolian street dogs are free-roaming pups that typically congregate in cities or towns with plentiful resources. They share many basic traits with pet dogs, but they lead primarily independent lives outdoors.","traits-appearance":"Though Mongolian street dogs can come in all shapes and sizes, street dogs tend to be medium-sized.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Street dogs typically have short, brownish coats. But any combination of coat colors, patterns, and lengths is genetically possible.","traits-physical":"Mongolian street dogs do not follow a breed standard. So, no shared set of traits links them together. That said, common characteristics of street dogs include prick ears and pointed noses.","temperament":"Street dogs must learn to fend for themselves. As a result, they tend to be scrappy, intelligent, and adaptable—all skills that support independent survival. Because they've never had to rely on humans, they may be fearful or skeptical of people who have not earned their trust.","care-nutrition":"A Mongolian street dog's diet typically consists of whatever they can kill or find—small farm animals, scraps from trash cans, handouts from kind strangers, and so on. If you're leaving food out for a street dog, they'll benefit from commercial diets formulated for pet dogs.\n\nBecause they fend for themselves, street dogs aren't usually at risk of becoming overweight. However, if you take a street dog under your roof, keep an eye on their food intake to avoid overfeeding. Guidelines on dog food packages are a good starting point when determining daily portions.","care-grooming":"If you've adopted a street dog that's comfortable being handled, regular brushing and nail trims will help them look their best. Good [dental hygiene](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) is also important for any dog. Professional cleanings and at-home dental care will keep their mouths healthy and reduce the risk of related health issues.","care-exercise":"All dogs need exercise to stay physically and mentally fit, and street dogs are no exception. Mongolian street dogs that are on their own will get adequate exercise during their daily roaming. Pet dogs, however, need access to the outdoors to stretch their legs and get mental stimulation. Playing in a fenced yard and going for leashed walks are great ways for your dog to release energy.","care-training":"Street dogs are not accustomed to obeying commands from people. In fact, many may avoid close contact with humans. Before attempting a training program, start by building trust and respect with your dog. Slow and steady is the best approach to making inroads with a street dog.","care-health":null,"references":"https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2015/10/central-asian-village-dogs-closest-original-dogs\n\nhttps://www.tierschutzxl.at/e/lei/mongolei.html\n\nhttps://www.rover.com/blog/village-dogs-around-the-world/\n\nhttps://www.companionanimalpsychology.com/2015/03/can-street-dogs-become-good-pets.html","reviewed-by":"Laura

LaPerm's story is a classic case of \"one of these things is not like the others.\" In 1982, a barn cat in Oregon gave birth to a litter of six kittens. Five of them appeared normal. But one was bald with a tabby pattern emblazoned in her skin. After several weeks, she started to grow a soft, curly tabby coat. The kitten's owner, Linda, aptly named her Curly.\n\nCurly eventually had a litter of her own. All five kittens were born bald, only to develop wavy coats like their mother. Linda found these cats odd but accepted them as they were and didn't give their unusual coats much thought. But as more wavy-haired cats resulted from random-bred litters over the years, Linda started to wonder if she had something special on her hands (and in her barn).\n\nAfter entering six of her cats at a cat show, Linda consulted with experts in the cat fancy. They concluded that the curly gene was dominant and carried by both male and female cats. Linda named the breed LaPerm (they did originate in the 1980s, after all) and worked with others to develop a breeding program.\n\nIn 2008, the CFA granted Championship status to the LaPerm.","facts":"LaPerms are one of several curly-coated cat breeds. Active and people-oriented with a gentle, affectionate nature, they're happy to run around or relax on the couch—as long as their favorite humans are beside them.","traits-appearance":"The LaPerm is a medium-sized, curly-coated cat with medium-boning and long legs. They have well-balanced, muscular bodies, alert expressions, and seem to walk tall on their feet.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"LaPerms can be longhaired or shorthaired. Shorthairs have light, springy coats that stand away from the body, bottlebrush tails, and curly or wavy hair. On the other hand, longhairs have semi-long hair with an airy texture, a plumed tail, and curls that give them a shaggier, unkempt look. Both types have kinked eyebrows and curled whiskers. And they come in all coat colors and patterns.","traits-physical":"The LaPerm's key features include a wedge-shaped head with gentle contours, medium-to-large slightly flared and cupped ears, and large, expressive almond-shaped eyes.","temperament":"LaPerms are gentle, affectionate cats that excel at both playing and snuggling. They have a patient nature and get along well with other pets and kids, making them an excellent addition to most families.\n\nThis active, curious breed wants to participate in all household activities. They follow their humans around and keep them entertained with their antics. As natural hunters, they enjoy stalking mouse toys and playing games of fetch. But when it's time to relax, they love to flop down in a lap to watch TV or nap. When cuddling with a LaPerm, expect gentle pats on the face—one of the many ways they show affection.","care-nutrition":"LaPerms need a high-quality diet formulated for their current life stage (e.g., kitten, adult, senior).\n\nTo keep your cat at a healthy weight, measure out meals and reduce portions if necessary. And don't forget to account for treats—especially if giving human food as rewards. Just one ounce of cheese can account for half of an average-sized cat's daily calories. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of your pet's caloric intake.\n\nLastly, all cats need access to fresh, clean water around the clock.","care-grooming":"LaPerms don't typically shed much, and their coats aren't prone to mats or tangles. So, light combing with a metal comb should be sufficient to remove any loose fur and keep their curls intact. After bathing your LaPerm, dry them with a towel instead of a blowdryer to prevent frizzing. And if you want to give their curls some added bounce, spraying their dry coat with a fine mist of water will do the trick.\n\nMost cats' nails require monthly trimming to prevent them from getting too long. Long nails are more likely to snag on something and become torn or damaged. They can even grow into your cat's paw pads, leading to pain or infection. In addition to clipping, providing a scratching post will allow your cat to do some nail maintenance themselves (thanks to their instinct to scratch).\n\nNo grooming routine is complete without a little dental hygiene. To support your LaPerm's overall health, brush their teeth daily and schedule visits with your veterinarian for professional dental cleanings and exams.","care-exercise":null,"care-training":null,"care-health":"Roughly one out of every three cats in the United States is overweight or obese.

Rican Street Dog","plural-name":"Costa Rican Street Dogs","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"Like all dogs, the Costa Rican street dog is a descendant of the gray wolf. At some point, a number of wolves became domesticated (but experts disagree on exactly when and how) and integrated into humans' daily lives.\n\nBy the 19th century, people began recording their efforts to selectively breed dogs for certain traits—a practice that led to the hundreds of purebred dogs we know and love today. But the majority of dogs around the world do not belong to a particular breed. This includes Costa Rican street dogs.\n\nToday, more than one million feral dogs wander Costa Rica. Some have been abandoned by their owners, while others were born on the streets. Local nonprofit groups are working to spay/neuter, care for, and rescue homeless dogs. And Costa Rica happens to be home to Territorio de Zaguates—a sanctuary that provides shelter and services to more than 1,300 stray dogs waiting to find their forever homes.","facts":"Costa Rican street dogs are free-roaming pups that typically congregate in cities or towns with plentiful resources. They share many basic traits with pet dogs, but they lead primarily independent lives outdoors.","traits-appearance":"Costa Rican street dogs can come in all shapes and sizes. But street dogs generally tend to be medium-sized.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Though any combination of coat colors, patterns, and lengths is genetically possible, street dogs typically have short, brownish coats.","traits-physical":"Costa Rican street dogs do not follow a breed standard, so no shared set of traits links them together. That said, common characteristics of street dogs include prick ears and pointed noses.","temperament":"Street dogs must learn to fend for themselves. As a result, they tend to be scrappy, intelligent, and adaptable—all skills that support independent survival. Because they've never had to rely on humans, they may be fearful or skeptical of people who have not earned their trust.","care-nutrition":"A Costa Rican street dog's diet typically consists of whatever they can kill or find—small farm animals, scraps from trash cans, handouts from kind strangers, and so on. If you're leaving food out for a street dog, they'll benefit from commercial diets formulated for pet dogs.\n\nBecause they fend for themselves, street dogs aren't usually at risk of becoming overweight. However, if you take a street dog under your roof, keep an eye on their food intake to avoid overfeeding. Guidelines on dog food packages are a good starting point when determining daily portions.","care-grooming":"If you've adopted a street dog that's comfortable being handled, regular brushing and nail trims will help them look their best. Good [dental hygiene](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) is also important for any dog. Professional cleanings and at-home dental care will keep their mouths healthy and reduce the risk of related health issues.","care-exercise":"All dogs need exercise to stay physically and mentally fit, and street dogs are no exception. Costa Rican street dogs that are on their own will get adequate exercise during their daily roaming. Pet dogs, however, need access to the outdoors to stretch their legs and get mental stimulation. Playing in a fenced yard and going for leashed walks are great ways for your dog to release energy.","care-training":"Street dogs are not accustomed to obeying commands from people. In fact, many may avoid close contact with humans. Before attempting a training program, start by building trust and respect with your dog. Slow and steady is the best approach to making inroads with a street

Domestic Cat","plural-name":null,"published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"cat","history":"Cats are among the most popular pets in the world, and Domestics are the most common type of cat. Often referred to as moggies, housecats, or alleycats, European Domestics descendants of random-bred cats.\n\nDomestic cats likely originated in the Fertile Crescent region—an area that includes Western Asia, Turkey, and Egypt—about 10,000 years ago. As humans traded their nomadic lifestyle for a stationary one centered on agriculture, wild cats congregated near their settlements to prey upon rodents. Farmers appreciated the pest control, and cats were happy with the abundance of food. Thus, the human-cat relationship began.\n\nExperts believe Greeks and Romans brought Domestic cats to Europe 3,000 years ago. But in the Middle Ages, cats became associated with witchcraft, and their numbers dwindled as a result. In the 1500s, after the plague decimated much of London's human population, cats regained popularity thanks to their rat-hunting prowess. European Domestics have been in the homes—and firmly in the hearts—of humans ever since.\n\nThough Domestics aren't pedigreed cats, some cat associations allow them to compete in shows in a general \"housecat\" category.","facts":"European Domestic cats are intelligent, independent felines that come in various shapes, colors, and sizes. But they share one thing in common: They're all easy to love.","traits-appearance":"European Domestics come in a wide range of colors, sizes, and builds. Still, they're typically medium-sized and muscular.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The coat of a Domestic cat comes in all colors, patterns, and lengths. Any coat combination that's genetically possible is on the table for this breed.","traits-physical":"European Domestics aren't defined by a specific set of physical characteristics. The average Domestic may display any number of adorable features.","temperament":"European Domestic cats' personalities are quite varied. They tend to be intelligent, independently minded, and able to take care of themselves. But they can be quiet or vocal, cuddly or aloof. Getting to know the quirks of a Domestic's personality is part of the fun of sharing a home with one.\n\nBecause of their background as rodent catchers, European Domestics are typically athletic and agile, with strong hunting instincts. Using feather toys and other items they can pounce on or chase gives them a much-needed outlet for their natural tendencies.\n\nDomestics also tend to enjoy keeping an eye on the outside world. High perches where they can safely look out at birds and other wildlife will keep them entertained for hours.","care-nutrition":"Domestic cats thrive on a high-quality diet. Because nutritional needs vary for kittens, adults, and senior cats, choose a formula that's age-appropriate for your pet.\n\nObesity is a growing health concern for all cats. To keep calories in check, portion out meals using a standard measuring cup, and reduce amounts if your cat gains weight. And keep an eye on how many treats you're giving them. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of a cat's daily calories.\n\nIn addition to their meals, make sure to provide plenty of fresh, clean water for your cat.","care-grooming":"European Domestics are excellent self-groomers. Still, they need regular brushing to keep their coats looking their best. Shorthaired cats can usually get by with weekly brushing using a rubber or steel comb. Longhaired cats are more prone to tangles and mats and may require daily brushing.\n\nIn addition to combing, trim their claws monthly to prevent overgrowth. Overgrown nails are more likely to snag on something, become torn or damaged, or even grow into the paw pads—leading to pain or infection. In addition to clipping, a scratching post will help keep your cat's nails in good shape and satisfy their instinct to scratch.\n\nFinally, all cats need regular dental care—including at-home teeth brushing and professional dental exams and cleanings.","care-exercise":null,"care-training":null,"care-health":"Roughly one out of every three cats in the United States is overweight or obese. Extra weight can contribute to other health risks, such as arthritis, diabetes, and heart problems. Your veterinarian is a great resource for tips on how to keep your cat at a healthy

is unconfirmed. Many experts believe the Welsh Terrier originated in 19th-century Wales—where residents of Carmarthenshire produced purebred Terriers meant to hunt foxes and badgers.\n\nShown in England for the first time in 1884, these dogs were known as \"Old English Terriers\" and \"Black-and-Tan Wirehaired Terriers.\" In 1888, Prescott Lawrence brought the breed to the United States. The American Kennel Club recognized it in the same year under the current name of Welsh Terrier.","facts":"Intelligent, alert, energetic, and usually friendly, the Welsh Terrier is a happy and good-natured breed. Welsh Terriers are brave and very protective—especially against other dogs—of their families and territory. Curious and full of character, they make wonderful pets.","traits-appearance":"Strong and hardy, Welsh Terriers look a lot like [Airedale Terriers](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/airedale-terrier) and are often mistaken for them.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Welsh Terrier's wiry coat is tan and either black or various shades. The shading is due to grizzle, or black hairs among the rest of the coat. The Welsh Terrier's coat often has a black jacket pattern.","traits-physical":"An elongated head with folded ears and a cheerful beard are the outstanding features of the Welsh Terrier.","temperament":"True to its terrier roots, the Welsh Terrier is an alert and spirited breed. Even though these dogs tend to be on the calmer side (at least as far as terriers go), they're best suited for homes with older children. Welsh Terriers are curious, full of fun, and enjoy typical dog activities such as playing and—unfortunately—digging.\n\nWelsh Terriers are relatively adaptable and eager to take on whatever lifestyle their people ask of them. Though they'd prefer country living, they're just as content in a city apartment (they're not excessive barkers) or suburban family home.\n\nWelsh Terriers may be timid around strangers. They're also known to chase smaller pets and can be difficult to distract once they're engaged in an activity.","care-nutrition":"The Welsh Terrier requires a high-quality dog food that is age-appropriate. As you should with any dog, it's important to monitor the amount of food you feed your Welsh Terrier and reduce the portions if your pup gains weight. Also, remember that giving too many treats in addition to regular meals can contribute to obesity.","care-grooming":"Welsh Terriers don't shed, so plucking the hair by hand (i.e., hand stripping) is an ideal way to keep their coats in top shape. Their coats also need to be brushed a couple of times a week and clipped every 8–12 weeks. Bathing between clippings is generally not necessary. But you should include weekly nail trims as part of the grooming routine.","care-exercise":"The Welsh Terrier is a highly energetic dog that enjoys activities with their people. Favorite ways to burn energy include daily brisk walks and backyard games—such as fetch, ball chasing, and frisbee catching. And if they can get in two walks per day, all the better.

Without a proper breed available suited to the task, post-Revolutionary frontiersman set out to create the breed they needed by crossing foxhounds and Bloodhounds to create a new, unique mix, which came to be known as a Coonhound.\n\nThe Black and Tan Coonhound is truly an American pup, with original stomping grounds in the southeastern region of the United States, across the Ozark, Blue Ridge, Appalachian, and Smoky Mountains. The Black and Tan even became the first Coonhound breed to be registered with the American Kennel Club in 1945.","facts":"Although the Black and Tan Coonhound is gentle and trusting, it can be stubborn at times, especially when interested in a certain activity. With the proper training, this dog makes an excellent family pet.","traits-appearance":"The Black and Tan Coonhound is a strong hound with long ears and expressive, soulful eyes.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"These dogs are, as the name implies, coal-black with rich tan markings.","traits-physical":"The long, droopy ears and expressive eyes are telling for this breed, as are the distinctive tan accents found throughout their coloring, particularly the ones referred to as “pumpkin seeds” which are above their eyes.","temperament":"The Black and Tan Coonhound is a very active and alert breed. It is intelligent and loyal, and enjoys frequent exercise and activities. These dogs are good-natured and they make excellent companions. They can be territorial and protective of their family, especially with strangers, but with the proper training they are very sociable.\n\nExperts at what they do, Coonhounds can trace raccoons through the woods and swamps by their scent alone, sending their prey scrambling up a tree until hunters, following their baying, catch up to trap the animals.\n\nEven-tempered and outgoing, this hound is a hard worker, particularly when it comes to scent tracking, which can sometimes lead to trouble. When walking a Black and Tan Coonhound, be sure to keep them leashed or in secure areas, since any scent can send them racing after the trail of prey.\n\nThis breed is sociable and prefers to be with people, so a Black and Tan Coonhound that’s left alone for too long will let nearby neighbors hear their sadness with loud and mournful wails.\n\nThey can be reserved around strangers, and they can be stubborn and territorial at times. Proper training and a steadfast exercise routine can help maintain a Coonhound’s health and happiness. ","care-nutrition":"Black and Tan Coonhounds require a high-quality dog food that is age-appropriate—whether it’s commercially manufactured or homemade (with a veterinarian’s supervision and approval). It’s important to monitor the amount of food you give your Black and Tan Coonhound. Reduce the portions or restrict calories if your pup gains weight.\n\nYour veterinarian is always a good source to help provide you with appropriate nutrition and feeding guidelines.","care-grooming":"Little care is required to handle the Black and Tan Coonhound’s short, dense coat. Once-weekly brushings with a grooming mitt or brush will help remove hair.\n\nAll dogs require regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care), including at-home teeth brushing and professional dental cleanings, and the Black and Tan Coonhound is no exception. Maintaining good dental hygiene is important for overall long-term health.","care-exercise":"Like most hounds, the Black and Tan Coonhound requires a regular exercise routine every day to stay healthy and to avoid getting into the trouble that boredom can bring. With a strong hunting instinct, these dogs love any game that involves a good chase, and can be readily trained to hunt animals other than raccoon, if that’s of interest. This breed also excels at dog sports like tracking and trailing.","care-training":"Black and Tan Coonhounds are smart, which makes them excellent candidates for training, although their stubborn, independent streak can sometimes get in the way. It’s essential to train this breed properly and early since, when left to their own devices, the Black and Tan Coonhound is apt to take off on a hunting spree, or to howl loudly for all to hear.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/black-and-tan-Coonhound/\n\nhttp://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/BlackandTanCoonhound.pdf","reviewed-by":"Laura Inman,

Angora","plural-name":null,"published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"cat","history":"As the name implies, the Turkish Angora originated in Turkey. In the 16th century, the city of Ankara (formerly Angora) was home to several animals with long, delicate, silky hair—including goats, rabbits, and what many people believe to be the first longhaired cats.\n\nTurkish Angoras quickly caught the attention of European cat fanciers. But when Persian cats gained popularity in the early 1900s, breeders began using Angoras primarily in their Persian breeding programs. As a result, Angoras nearly disappeared as a distinct breed. Fortunately, the Ankara Zoo set out to save this beautiful breed. They developed a breeding program that focused on preserving cats with white-colored coats and blue, gold, or odd eyes.\n\nFor years, Turkish Angoras mostly remained in their native country. But when American soldiers reported seeing the breed at the Ankara Zoo, interest began to grow in the United States. The zoo resisted exporting the cats at first. It wasn't until 1962 that they released a breeding pair to Colonel and Mrs. Walter Grant. The resulting litter became the foundation of the Angora breeding program in the U.S.\n\nThe Cat Fanciers Association accepted white Angoras for Championship competition in 1972, followed by colored Angoras in 1978.","facts":"Turkish Angoras are regal, extroverted cats famous for their intelligence and athletic abilities. When they're not busy supervising their humans, they like to spend their time perched in a window or playing with their favorite toys.","traits-appearance":"Turkish Angoras are medium-sized cats with a balanced, graceful appearance. They are slender yet muscular, with long legs and a gorgeous, shimmering coat.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Angora's semi-long coat has a soft, fine texture and silky sheen. The hair is longest on the tail and ruff, and the breed has visible britches on the hind legs. White is the most popular color for Angoras, but they come in many traditional colors and patterns.","traits-physical":"Angoras have small-to-medium-sized wedge-shaped heads topped with large, tufted ears. Their almond-shaped eyes can be blue, green, green-gold, amber, or odd-eyed (one blue and one green, green-gold, or amber). They have long, graceful necks, slender, muscular bodies, and long, tapering tails.","temperament":"Turkish Angoras are outgoing, clever cats that want (scratch that, **need**) to be involved in everything their humans do. They'll follow their people around during the day to supervise activities and snuggle up under the covers with them at night. And they expect their families to be just as devoted to them in return.\n\nThese active, agile cats have one speed: fast. They enjoy racing around the house, chasing toys, and fetching objects. Their kitten-like playfulness never goes away. They're always up for some fun.\n\nAnd if ever you can't find your Angora, look up. Chances are they've scaled to the top of a door or perched themselves high on a bookshelf. This athletic ability, combined with their intelligence, makes them well-suited for feline agility.\n\nAngoras will happily cohabitate with dogs and other pets—as long as all understand that they are in charge.","care-nutrition":"Turkish Angoras are energetic cats that require a high-quality diet to meet their nutritional needs. Because those needs differ for kittens, adults, and senior cats, opt for a formula that's age-appropriate for your pet.\n\nEven an active cat like an Angora is at risk for obesity if they overeat. To keep calories in check, measure out meals and reduce portions if necessary. And don't forget to account for calories from treats in your cat's daily totals. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of their calories.\n\nFinally, all cats need access to fresh, clean water around the clock.","care-grooming":"The Angora's coat rarely tangles or mats. And because they don't have an undercoat, shedding is minimal. An occasional brushing is all that's needed to keep them looking their best.\n\nMost cats' nails require monthly trimming to prevent them from getting too long. Long nails are more likely to snag on something and become torn or damaged. They can even grow into your cat's paw pads, leading to pain or infection. In addition to clipping, providing a scratching post will allow your cat to do some nail maintenance themselves (thanks to their instinct to scratch).\n\nNo grooming routine is complete without a little dental hygiene. To support your Angora's overall health, brush their teeth daily and schedule visits with your veterinarian for professional dental cleanings and exams.","care-exercise":null,"care-training":null,"care-health":"White Angoras may be prone to full or partial deafness. A brainstem auditory evoked response (BAER) test can evaluate your cat's ability to hear. If the results show hearing loss, your veterinarian or an animal behaviorist are great resources for advice on raising a hearing-impaired pet.","references":"https://cfa.org/turkish-angora/\n\nhttps://cfa.org/turkish-angora/turkish-angora-article-2001/\n\nhttps://tica.org/breeds/browse-all-breeds?view=article&id=886:turkish-angora-breed&catid=79\n\nhttps://cfa.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/turkish-angora-standard.pdf\n\nhttps://tica.org/breeds/browse-all-breeds?view=article&id=1233:the-turkish-angora-breed&catid=48","reviewed-by":"Laura

Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog","plural-name":"Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dogs","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"It's a mistake to assume the Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dogs is just an [Australian Cattle Dog](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/australian-cattle-dog) with a docked tail. This naturally bob-tailed breed has its own story and characteristics.\n\nThe Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog was the first breed developed in Australia. The first dogs were a mix of Smithfield, an English herding dog, and an indigenous Australian Dingo. The breed—either referred to as Hall's Heelers or Timmins Biters, depending on who is given credit for developing it—was hailed as a valuable working dog with incredible stamina. Ranchers felt the dogs were too severe with the stock, so another breed was added to soften their temperaments. Crossing the dogs with a smooth-haired blue merle Collie led to the creation of the current Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog.\n\nIn the 1890s, both long-and stumpy-tailed varieties appeared in local shows in equal numbers. But over time, the number of Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dogs declined. A single breeder remained in the 1960s, and two decades later, the breed was near extinction. The Australian National Kennel Council launched a redevelopment effort to restore their numbers and successfully reinvigorated the breed.","facts":"The Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog is more than an Australian Cattle Dog with a docked tail. These bundles of energy have loyal, courageous, and devoted dispositions and want nothing more than good work and loving homes.","traits-appearance":"The Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog is a well-proportioned working dog with a square profile, rugged appearance, and muscular build.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dogs are double-coated with short, dense, soft undercoats and short, straight, dense outer coats with a harsh texture. The coat is longer and thicker around their necks, forming a mild ruff, and shorter on their head, legs, and feet.\n\nThe breed comes in two colors: blue and red speckle. Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dogs with blue coloring should be blue or blue mottled. There may be black markings on their heads or bodies.\n\nRed speckled dogs should have an even red speckle all over their bodies, including the undercoat (which should not be white or cream), with or without dark red markings on their heads. Some have red patches on the body.","traits-physical":"Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dogs have broad chests with well-sprung ribs, deep, muscular loins, and muscular hindquarters. The breed also has oval-shaped, medium-sized eyes with an intelligent but suspicious expression. Their moderately small ears are pricked and almost pointed. And per the breed standard, their undocked tails should not exceed four inches in length.","temperament":"Like Australian Cattle Dogs, Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dogs are known for their loyalty and protective instincts. These dogs are always looking out for their people and property. Ever alert and watchful, they can be suspicious of strangers or territorial. Due to their high-energy natures, these dogs do best in a house with a fenced yard or owner committed to regular trips to the dog park.","care-nutrition":"Feed Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dogs a high-quality dog food that is appropriate for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior) and consider a diet formulated for active breeds. Though these highly active dogs are not known for being overweight, it's still a good idea to portion out their food with a measuring cup and limit treats to no more than 10% of their daily calories to avoid overfeeding.","care-grooming":"Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dogs have minimal grooming requirements. Regular brushing and an occasional bath are all it takes to keep them looking good. During semi-annual shedding seasons, daily brushing will help remove cast-off undercoat and minimize shedding. The breed has fast-growing nails that may need almost-weekly trimming to keep them from becoming overgrown and sharp.\n\nLike all breeds, Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dogs benefit from regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care). Start a routine that includes at-home teeth-brushing and professional cleanings to ensure good oral hygiene throughout their lives.","care-exercise":"Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dogs are an active breed that loves being on the go. In the absence of a job (such as herding stock) these dogs require regular, high-intensity exercise. Long walks (or runs), trips to the dog park, swimming, hiking, or other activities that let them show off their stamina and endurance are ideal.\n\nThese are intelligent dogs that excel in herding, agility, rally, competitive obedience, and other dog sports. Mental stimulation such as puzzle toys and new tricks can help Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dogs satisfy their need for near-constant physical and mental stimulation.","care-training":"Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dogs love learning new things. Keep training activities short and fun (but not repetitive) and use positive reinforcement and reward-based training. [Socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) is essential to temper their territorial instincts.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/australian-cattle-dog/\n\nhttp://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/AustralianCattleDog.pdf","reviewed-by":"Laura Inman, DVM","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":18.1,"weight-range-pet-max":21.8,"weight-range-show-min":18.1,"weight-range-show-max":21.8,"height-range-min":43.0,"height-range-max":51.0,"life-span-range-min":12.0,"life-span-range-max":15.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":97,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":57,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":41},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/920bdd3f-4ee2-5aaf-8003-ac9f139bf1ca/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/920bdd3f-4ee2-5aaf-8003-ac9f139bf1ca/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/920bdd3f-4ee2-5aaf-8003-ac9f139bf1ca/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/920bdd3f-4ee2-5aaf-8003-ac9f139bf1ca/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/920bdd3f-4ee2-5aaf-8003-ac9f139bf1ca/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/920bdd3f-4ee2-5aaf-8003-ac9f139bf1ca/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/920bdd3f-4ee2-5aaf-8003-ac9f139bf1ca/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/920bdd3f-4ee2-5aaf-8003-ac9f139bf1ca/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/920bdd3f-4ee2-5aaf-8003-ac9f139bf1ca/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/920bdd3f-4ee2-5aaf-8003-ac9f139bf1ca/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/920bdd3f-4ee2-5aaf-8003-ac9f139bf1ca/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/920bdd3f-4ee2-5aaf-8003-ac9f139bf1ca/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/920bdd3f-4ee2-5aaf-8003-ac9f139bf1ca/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/920bdd3f-4ee2-5aaf-8003-ac9f139bf1ca/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/920bdd3f-4ee2-5aaf-8003-ac9f139bf1ca/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/920bdd3f-4ee2-5aaf-8003-ac9f139bf1ca/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/920bdd3f-4ee2-5aaf-8003-ac9f139bf1ca/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/920bdd3f-4ee2-5aaf-8003-ac9f139bf1ca/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"9249d754-e42f-5651-b17f-ce70f8291207","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9249d754-e42f-5651-b17f-ce70f8291207"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"ragdoll","name":"Ragdoll","plural-name":null,"published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"cat","history":"The Ragdoll breed got its start in Riverside, CA, in the 1960s. Eccentric breeder Ann Baker mated a longhaired white cat named Josephine with other cats she owned or found in the neighborhood. These likely included a seal point mitted cat and a solid black cat.\n\nBaker maintained that injuries from a car accident altered Josephine's genes—and that's why subsequent litters of her kittens had the floppy, laid-back personality associated with Ragdolls today. Though Baker's explanation isn't biologically possible, it does make a great story!\n\nSeveral breeders contracted as a franchise under Baker's breeding program (and under her watchful eye). Eventually, they branched out on their own to continue developing the breed standard.\n\nToday, Ragdolls are a popular breed thanks to their happy, relaxed dispositions and striking good looks.","facts":"Ragdolls are large, easy-going cats with affectionate personalities. They love to play and are happy to flop over in their human's arms for a cuddle session when it's time for a break.","traits-appearance":"Ragdolls are large, semi-longhaired cats with blue eyes. They have strong, muscular bodies but are slow to mature and may not reach their full size and coat color until they're about four years old.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Ragdoll has an abundant, silky topcoat and minimal undercoat. The cat's hair grows short on the face and increases in length as it moves down the back. Long hair surrounds the breed's neck and frames the outside of the face, forming a bib. The hair on the belly, side, and back legs is medium length, while the hair on the front legs is short-to-medium. The tail is fully feathered.\n\nRagdolls are pointed cats, which means they have darker colors on the face, legs, tail, and ears. They come in seal, blue, chocolate, lilac, red, cream, cinnamon, or fawn, and can have tortie or tabby markings. Their color pattern can be colorpoint (dark points with no white and a strong contrast between light body color and point color), mitted (pointed with white paws, a white chin, and a white belly stripe), or bicolor (white chest, legs, stomach, and ruff with an inverted white \"V\" on the face).","traits-physical":"One of the trademark traits of the Ragdoll is large, oval-shaped, strikingly blue eyes. Other physical characteristics include medium-sized ears with rounded tips, a long, rectangular-shaped body, round, tufted paws, and a long, bushy tail.","temperament":"Ragdolls are loving, relaxed, family-friendly cats. They enjoy being around people and often greet their humans at the door and follow them from room to room. Their trademark way of showing trust and affection is to flop limply in their owner's arms when cuddled.\n\nThis breed is very tolerant of other pets and kids. Because they are so laid back and quiet, Ragdolls aren't likely to be a good fit for someone looking for an active, energetic cat. They aren't overly athletic (and can sometimes be downright clumsy). So, short cat trees and an indoor lifestyle help keep these felines safe from injury.\n\nThough Ragdolls are very easy-going and calm, they still enjoy short playing sessions and can even learn to fetch. This skill—along with their general intelligence and happy disposition—has earned them a reputation as a \"dog-like\" cat.","care-nutrition":"Ragdolls need a high-quality diet. Because nutritional needs vary for kittens, adults, and senior cats, take care to choose a formula that's age-appropriate for your pet. You might also consider diets designed for the Ragdoll's unique needs. For example, a breed-specific diet may include nutrients that help keep their coats shiny or bones and joints healthy—two key concerns for Ragdolls.\n\nAll cats can become overweight if they eat too many calories. But because of their large size, a few extra pounds can be especially taxing on Ragdolls' joints. To avoid overfeeding, carefully measure out your cat's food with a standard measuring cup and reduce portions if they gain weight. And keep an eye on the number of treats you're feeding. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of a cat's daily calories.\n\nIn addition to daily meals, make sure there's a bowl of fresh, clean water available at all times. Your Ragdoll may enjoy drinking out of water fountains.","care-grooming":"To keep your Ragdoll's silky coat looking its best, brush weekly with a stainless steel comb. Your cat may require extra grooming sessions during seasonal shedding periods. However, their minimal undercoat means reduced shedding and matting compared to other longhaired breeds.\n\nIn addition to regular brushing, trim your cat's nails once a month to keep them at an appropriate length. Nails that get too long are more likely to snag on something and become torn or damaged. Overgrown nails can also grow into your cat's paw pads, leading to pain or infection. Besides clipping, providing a scratching post will help keep their nails in good shape and satisfy their instinct to scratch.\n\nDental care is also essential to their overall health. Do your best to brush your cat's teeth at home, and don't forget to schedule professional exams and dental cleanings with your veterinarian.","care-exercise":null,"care-training":null,"care-health":"The Ragdoll's large size makes them more prone to issues with their bones or joints. Keeping your cat at a healthy weight will help prevent them from taxing their joints with unnecessary pounds. You can also talk to your veterinarian about supplements that may improve bone or joint

Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever","plural-name":"Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retrievers","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"You might be able to guess the origin of the Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever based on the breed's name. Developed as gundogs in Nova Scotia, Canada, in the 19th century, these pups have a unique hunting style. Unlike traditional retrievers, Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retrievers don't wait for birds to fall after being shot. Instead, they toll (a Middle English word meaning \"entice\") offshore birds to within gun range.\n\nHere's how: The hunter tosses a ball or stick into the water and stays hidden in the blind while the dog retrieves it. As the dog plays and splashes near the water, nearby waterfowl become intrigued by the motion and white markings on the dog's red coat. Once they swim over for a closer look and are in range, the hunter calls the dog back and stands up, causing the birds to fly. Then, after the hunter takes his shots, the dog retrieves the downed ducks from the water.\n\nNo one knows exactly which breeds combined to form the Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever. But experts believe the [Cocker Spaniel](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/cocker-spaniel), [Golden Retriever](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/golden-retriever), and/or [Irish Setter](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/irish-setter) were likely part of the mix.\n\nNova Scotia Duck Tolling Retrievers came to the United States, Europe, and Australia during the 1960s. When the American Kennel Club recognized the breed in 2003, it became the club's longest-named breed. To avoid the mouthful, many people refer to them simply as \"Tollers.\"","facts":"The Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever is a happy, active, and intelligent breed. These foxy red dogs love hunting, playing, and—provided they've had enough exercise—lounging on the couch with their favorite humans.","traits-appearance":"The smallest of the retriever breeds, Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retrievers are powerful, compact, balanced dogs that give the appearance of strength and agility.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever has a medium-length, water-repellent double coat that protects it from icy cold water while retrieving.\n\nThe Toller's coat can be any shade of red—including golden red, dark copper, buff, and fawn. Lighter shading may appear in the coat's feathering. A white chest blaze or other white markings on the tail, muzzle, or feet also show up in this breed. This color combination gives Tollers the fox-like appearance that helps attract curious ducks during hunting expeditions.","traits-physical":"Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retrievers seem to have a sad or worried look on their faces when they're not working. But that all changes when they spring into action to retrieve. Then, their expression shifts to one of concentration and excitement.\n\nCarried in a high curve, the Toller's well-feathered tail is constantly in motion when the dog is alert and working.","temperament":"Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retrievers are energetic, playful, and smart dogs that do well as members of active, outdoorsy families.\n\nTollers are friendly with kids but often wary or reserved around people they don't know. Because of this wariness, they're unlikely to stand up to strangers and therefore don't tend to make good guard dogs.\n\nThanks to their hunting and retrieving background, Tollers have a strong prey drive and like to chase other animals. Homes with cats or other pets that won't appreciate this (usually harmless) game may not be a good fit for this breed.\n\nAn excited Toller is often a loud Toller. These pups have a high-pitched bark (more of a scream, really) that is piercing and frantic. Teaching a Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever not to be vocal requires patience and persistence. [Early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) can help.","care-nutrition":"Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retrievers need a high-quality dog food that's appropriate for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior.) To meet this active breed's nutritional needs, consider a diet formulated specifically for medium-size dogs.\n\nAll dogs are at risk for obesity if they eat too many calories. Avoid accidental overfeeding by measuring out meals. And be sure to consider calories from treats when calculating their daily intake. As a general guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of a dog's calories.","care-grooming":"For most of the year, Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retrievers need only weekly brushing to stay looking their best. But during shedding periods (when they blow their coats), they require more frequent grooming.\n\nIt's important to trim a Toller's nails regularly, as long nails can cause pain or walking issues. And maintaining good [dental hygiene](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) is essential for any dog's overall long-term health. Aim to establish an at-home routine that includes regular teeth brushing and dental chews or toys, and talk with your veterinarian about professional dental cleanings.","care-exercise":"Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retrievers are tireless dogs that need a lot of daily exercise to be happy. They enjoy all the usual dog sports such as flyball, hunt and field trials, agility, tracking, and obedience. These activities provide a physical outlet for their energy and a mental work out.\n\nLong walks, jogs, and hikes are other great ways to provide exercise. But for a Toller, nothing beats retrieving. To win this breed's heart, throw a ball. And then throw it again. And again. And again. And… you get the picture.","care-training":"Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retrievers are incredibly smart and relatively easy to train. However, a firm (but gentle) approach is usually required. If Tollers sense that their humans aren't in charge of the household, they will happily take on the role.\n\nTollers tend to be food-motivated. So, favorite treats make for compelling rewards during training sessions. But keep in mind, this breed is sometimes easily distracted. So, keep training sessions short or varied.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/nova-scotia-duck-tolling-retriever/\n\nhttp://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/NovaScotiaDuckTollingRetriever.pdf\n\nhttps://www.akc.org/expert-advice/lifestyle/10-reasons-to-get-a-toller/\n\nhttps://www.akc.org/expert-advice/lifestyle/9-things-you-didnt-know-about-the-nova-scotia-duck-tolling-retriever/","reviewed-by":"Annette Louviere, DVM","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":14.5,"weight-range-pet-max":30.8,"weight-range-show-min":15.9,"weight-range-show-max":24.9,"height-range-min":43.0,"height-range-max":53.0,"life-span-range-min":12.0,"life-span-range-max":14.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":109,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":70,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":46},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/931c2e73-c065-5541-9215-cf4d0469a337/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/931c2e73-c065-5541-9215-cf4d0469a337/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/931c2e73-c065-5541-9215-cf4d0469a337/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/931c2e73-c065-5541-9215-cf4d0469a337/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/931c2e73-c065-5541-9215-cf4d0469a337/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/931c2e73-c065-5541-9215-cf4d0469a337/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/931c2e73-c065-5541-9215-cf4d0469a337/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/931c2e73-c065-5541-9215-cf4d0469a337/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/931c2e73-c065-5541-9215-cf4d0469a337/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/931c2e73-c065-5541-9215-cf4d0469a337/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/931c2e73-c065-5541-9215-cf4d0469a337/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/931c2e73-c065-5541-9215-cf4d0469a337/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/931c2e73-c065-5541-9215-cf4d0469a337/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/931c2e73-c065-5541-9215-cf4d0469a337/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/931c2e73-c065-5541-9215-cf4d0469a337/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/931c2e73-c065-5541-9215-cf4d0469a337/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/931c2e73-c065-5541-9215-cf4d0469a337/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/931c2e73-c065-5541-9215-cf4d0469a337/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"9370046a-4874-585f-a2b7-4e6da3fc1c81","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9370046a-4874-585f-a2b7-4e6da3fc1c81"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"alaskan-husky","name":"Alaskan Husky","plural-name":"Alaskan Huskies","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"Sled racers and fans of the sport are undoubtedly familiar with the Alaskan Husky. Everyone else? Maybe not. Unlike some dog breeds developed for both performance and appearance, Alaskan Huskies are bred for performance alone.\n\nHumans have a long (as in \"more than 15,000 years\" long) history of using dogs to pull sleds. Sled dogs had their North American heyday during the gold rush period of the late 1800s and early 1900s. Gold seekers regularly relied on dogs like the Alaskan Husky to transport people and supplies across frozen terrain.\n\nNative dogs in the far north, such as the Inuit and Interior Village dogs, are the foundation of the modern Alaskan Husky. Breeders crossed these dogs with purebreds, including the [Alaskan Malamute](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/alaskan-malamute), [Siberian Husky](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/siberian-husky), [Pointer](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/pointer), and [Saluki](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/saluki), to create dogs built for speed and endurance.\n\nToday, Alaskan Huskies are the preferred dog of sprint and distance mushers in the north.","facts":"Alaskan Huskies are strong-willed, confident, hardworking dogs. Born to run, they're dedicated to their people and make a great addition to active families.","traits-appearance":"Because they're bred for performance and not appearance, Alaskan Huskies can look quite different from one another. But they're typically medium-sized dogs with prick ears.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The length of the Alaskan Husky's coat varies. Dogs with shorter coats are best suited for sprinting because they can more easily shed heat from their bodies. On the other hand, distance dogs have longer hair and thicker coats to protect them from frigid temperatures on long trips. The breed's coat can come in any color or pattern.","traits-physical":"Alaskan Huskies are strong, lean dogs with tough feet that allow them to move across frozen terrain.","temperament":"Alaskan Huskies are smart, dedicated, hardworking dogs. Bred to pull sleds, these pups need to stay active to be happy. When they get enough exercise, they make calm housemates. But if they don't burn off enough energy, they may turn their attention to unwanted behaviors—such as chewing or digging.\n\nSince they're used to working in a group, Alaskan Huskies have a strong pack mentality. That means they love being part of a family and prefer not to be alone.","care-nutrition":"These dogs thrive on a high-quality diet formulated for their life stage. And working Alaskan Huskies need their diets adjusted seasonally. (More protein during the winter months when they're pulling sleds, and less in the summer when they're not as active.)\n\nIt's important to keep an eye on your pup's food intake to ensure they maintain a healthy weight. Measure their portions to avoid overfeeding and limit treats to no more than 10% of their daily calories.","care-grooming":"Brushing an Alaskan Husky's coat once or twice a week will help keep it clean and healthy. During periods of seasonal shedding, more frequent brushing with a pin brush will help remove the old coat. Regular nail trims should also be part of their grooming routine. Nails that get overly long can cause pain and potentially lead to problems running or walking.\n\nGood [dental hygiene](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) is also essential to your dog's long-term health. Dental disease is one of the most common health conditions in adult dogs. Left untreated, it can lead to serious issues. In addition to professional cleanings, establish an at-home dental care program that includes regular teeth brushing and veterinarian-recommended dental chews.","care-exercise":"Alaskan Huskies need a lot of physical exercise. They're happiest when showing off their natural skills during winter sports—such as sledding, skijoring (pulling a skier), and carting. When that's not an option, long walks and runs will do the trick.\n\n[Basic obedience training](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-obedience-training) will also provide them with much-needed mental exercise.","care-training":"Alaskan Huskies can be very strong-willed. To combat any stubborn tendencies, start consistent and firm (but gentle) training during puppyhood. Reward-based methods using treats and favorite toys work well for this

Komondor is the largest of the Hungarian breeds. The dogs are believed to be descended from the Owtcharka, an Asian shepherd dog that was brought to Hungary around the tenth century. Unlike other breeds that farmers used to help with livestock, Komondorok (the plural of Komondor) were not bred to herd sheep, just protect them.\n\nWhile working in harsh conditions, these dogs made excellent guardians, protecting sheep from predators such as wolves, coyotes, and feral dogs. The dense white cords of their coats helped Komondorok blend in with their flocks and provide protection against the elements and predators.","facts":"Komondors are big, brave dogs that show outsized devotion and affection to their loved ones. These one-time flock protectors make excellent guard dogs that will do their best to keep their families safe.","traits-appearance":"Komondorok are large, muscular dogs known for being agile, light on their feet, and moving with long strides.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Komondor is known for its trademark coat. It is a double-coated breed with a dense, soft, woolly undercoat and an overcoat made up of strong, tassel-like cords that form naturally from coarse, wavy, or curly hair. The cords, which feel like felt, grow longer with age.\n\nPuppies have soft, curly coats; as the dogs grow, their coats turn into short cords with fluffy balls on the ends. The breed standard does not penalize younger dogs for not having fully-formed cords but dogs whose cords fail to form by the time they are two years old are disqualified. Komondorok are white. Puppies might have cream or buff shading that fades with age.","traits-physical":"Komondorok are large dogs with significant bone and substance. They have level, strong backs; deep, powerful chests; muscular fore- and hindquarters; large feet with close, well-arched toes; and tails that are long enough to reach the hocks when hanging. Komondorok also have large heads, almond-shaped eyes, and triangular ears that are rounded at the tips.","temperament":"Although Komondorok are large, imposing dogs that were bred to take on predators, they are loving lapdogs with their families. Komondorok are still working dogs at heart and thrive when provided opportunities to look out for others, which is the reason these are great guard dogs.\n\nThese courageous protectors can be wary of strangers so socialization is essential. Komondorok may also perceive a group of unfamiliar dogs as a threat and go on the offensive, making them ill-suited to playing off leash at the dog park or doggie daycare.\n\nDue to their quiet natures and moderate exercise needs, Komondorok make surprisingly good apartment dogs.","care-nutrition":"Despite their size, Komondorok do not eat big meals. These dogs will do best when fed a high quality dog food that is appropriate for their life stage (puppy, adult, senior).","care-grooming":"Komondor cords might grow naturally but achieving a beautiful coat requires care. Before Komondorok reach one year old, their coats start to clump; separating the clumps into quarter-sized sections ensures that the cords will grow out beautifully.\n\nMature cords cannot be brushed but occasional baths help keep them clean. Komondorok must have their coats dried completely after a bath. Use a fan or lots of towels and squeeze-drying to remove all of the moisture and prevent the cords from becoming smelly.\n\nKomondorok also need regular ear cleanings, nail trims, and a [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) routine that includes at-home teeth brushing and professional cleanings.","care-exercise":"Komondorok have moderate exercise needs. Daily walks or games of fetch in a fenced yard will help them burn off their energy. Do not expect Komondorok to go outside to play on their own; these are very social dogs that are devoted to their owners. Their protective instincts make them want to keep their families close; these dogs do not want to be left alone for long periods.","care-training":"The Komondor excels at working solo, making decisions for the wellbeing of its flock without direction from a master. Thus, the breed retains that stubborn, independent streak. Consistent training can help Komondorok master basic commands and learn new tricks. These dogs respond best to positive reinforcement and rewards; training that is too heavy-handed could cause Komondorok to shut down.\n\nSocialization is important, too. Komondorok have strong protective instincts and need lots of positive interactions with strangers in order to learn to let their guards down.","care-health":null,"references":"https://komondorclubofamerica.org/about-the-komondor/\n\nhttp://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/Komondor.pdf\n\nhttps://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/komondor/","reviewed-by":"Cindy

Italiano","plural-name":"Segugi Italiani","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"Also known as the Segit, the Segugio Italiano is an ancient scenthound. Though the breed's exact origins are unknown, experts believe these dogs descended from primitive Egyptian hounds that Phoenician traders brought to Italy. Italian paintings and sculptures of dogs closely resembling Segugi (the plural form of Segugio) dating back to the 1600s offer further evidence of the breed's long history in the region.\n\nThese speedy dogs earned their keep hunting wild boar. And when the countryside's boar population began to decline, so did the number of Segugi. Fortunately, determined hunters saved the Segugio from extinction by training the dogs to hunt smaller animals, such as rabbits.\n\nThe Segugio's popularity surged after the breed won the European Cup in 1933. These pups have remained favorites in the Italian countryside ever since.","facts":"The Segugio Italiano is a lively, intelligent breed that's adored equally in the field and home. These hounds hunt well solo and in packs and make calm, eager-to-please pets.","traits-appearance":"Well-balanced and lean but muscular, the Segugio is a robust hound with a deep chest and medium proportions.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Segugio comes in both smooth- and rough-haired varieties. The smooth-haired dogs have dense, straight, short coats with a horse hair texture. Rough-haired Segugi have rough coats, as the name implies, but the coat is smoother on the head, ears, legs, tail, and muzzle compared to the body.\n\nBoth coat types come in shades of solid fawn—from intense red to faded fawn—or black and tan. Black and tan dogs have tan markings on the muzzle, eyebrows, chest, and legs. If they have white stars on their chest, they're called tricolored. Fawn dogs may have white markings on the muzzle and skull, a white star on the chest, or white on the neck, hocks, feet, and tail. But white is not desirable, according to the breed standard.","traits-physical":"Segugi have longish, oval heads and Roman noses. Their large, almond-shaped eyes come in a dark ochre color and offer a soft expression. They have long, triangular-shaped hanging ears that start wide and end in a narrow point. Their thin tails are set high, hanging when at rest and raised above the back when in action.","temperament":"The Segugio Italiano is a calm, reserved breed. These dogs love spending time outdoors and are happiest when hunting. They become very vocal when following a scent, showing off their deep, musical bark.\n\nDespite being excellent trackers, Segugi rarely go after unintended targets—good news for neighborhood cats and small animals. Though naturally independent, these pups can be gentle, loving companions that fit right in as members of active families.","care-nutrition":"Segugi thrive on a high-quality diet formulated for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior) and energy level.\n\nBecause of their deep chests, these dogs are at a greater risk of bloat (also known as twisted stomach). To help prevent bloat, break your dog's food up into several meals a day, and use a food bowl designed to slow their eating. Also, avoid feeding immediately before or after any kind of vigorous activity. These are just a few ways you can help prevent this life-threatening condition. Consult your veterinarian about other methods, including surgical options.\n\nTo help your Segugio Italiano maintain their lean physique, monitor their food intake and measure portions to avoid accidental overfeeding. When giving treats during training sessions (or just to reward general cuteness), keep in mind that they should make up no more than 10% of your dog's daily calories.","care-grooming":"Both smooth- and rough-haired Segugi require brushing a couple of times a week to keep their coats clean and healthy. Their long ears, though adorable, may be more susceptible to ear infections. Regularly check them for debris or wax build-up, and clean them as needed to help prevent issues.\n\nGood [dental hygiene](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) is also essential for any dog's overall long-term health. In addition to professional dental cleanings, establish an at-home dental care routine that includes regular teeth brushing.","care-exercise":"The Segugio Italiano has a lot of energy and stamina. That means they need plenty of exercise (ideally a couple of hours a day) to keep them physically and mentally fit. Brisk walks, trips to the dog park, and backyard scent games are all great ways to help them burn off energy. They also enjoy dog sports—such as agility, competitive obedience, and rally.","care-training":"Segugi are eager-to-please pups, which comes in handy during training sessions. Quick learners, they benefit from firm and consistent training techniques.\n\n[Socializing your pup early](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) will help them develop into a well-mannered adult dog.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/segugio-italiano/\n\nhttps://www.eukanuba.co.uk/breeds/italian-short-haired-hound-(segugio-italiano-a-pelo-raso)\n\nhttps://www.royalcanin.com/hk/en_hk/dogs/breeds/breed-library/italian-short-haired-segugio\n\nhttp://www.fci.be/Nomenclature/Standards/337g06-en.pdf\n\nhttp://www.fci.be/Nomenclature/Standards/198g06-en.pdf","reviewed-by":"Jamie

Pudelpointer originated in Germany in the late 1800s. At that time, German sportsmen were developing gun dogs suited to their way of hunting. A well-known author and expert on hunting dogs, who wrote under the pen name Hegewald, convinced hunters to cross [Poodles](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/poodle-standard) with [English Pointers](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/pointer). His goal was to create a breed that combined the Poodle's love of water, trainability, retrieving skills, and protective coat with the English Pointer's keen nose, pointing instincts, and zeal for hunting.\n\nBreeders used far more Pointers than Poodles when establishing the breeding program. And once they achieved the look and character they were after, they no longer relied on Pointers and, instead, mated Pudelpointers to other Pudelpointers. The breed register was founded in 1892, and breeders formed the first Pudelpointer club in 1897.\n\nH.D. Hume and Sigbot Winterhelt introduced the breed to North America in 1956. Today, most Pudelpointers are bred in Germany or the United States. The United Kennel Club recognized the breed in 2006, and the American Kennel Club has recorded it in their Foundation Stock Service since 2016.","facts":"Pudelpointers are intelligent, calm, versatile gun dogs. They're excellent in the water and always eager to please. Though bred to hunt, these pups have friendly, goofy personalities that make them enjoyable family companions at home.","traits-appearance":"The Pudelpointer is a medium-sized, strong-boned gun dog with the general look of a Pointer.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Pudelpointers have close, flat-lying, rough coats of medium-length with a dense undercoat. They sport adorable beards and a lock of hair above the forehead. Their coats are typically brown, dead leaf (a lighter shade of brown), or black. Some dogs have small white markings.","traits-physical":"This breed has a flat, moderately broad skull and large, dark amber eyes. Pudelpointers' medium-sized ears lie flat and are well-covered in hair. And their straight tails reach the hock and are carried like a saber.","temperament":"Pudelpointers are hunting dogs through and through. They have strong retrieving instincts and a love of water—making them an excellent choice for waterfowl hunters.\n\nThese calm, self-controlled pups typically get along well with other dogs. They also have a friendly, easy-going nature and clownish personality. As a result, they're just as much fun to be around at home as out in the field.","care-nutrition":"Pudelpointers thrive on a high-quality diet formulated for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior) and breed size.\n\nObesity is a growing health concern for dogs. To help yours maintain a healthy weight, keep an eye on their food intake and measure their portions with a standard measuring cup to avoid overfeeding. And don't forget to account for treats. As a guideline, they should make up no more than 10% of a dog's daily calories.","care-grooming":"Pudelpointers need weekly brushing to remove loose hair from their coats. Occasional baths will also help keep them clean—particularly after a day of hunting in the field or woods.\n\nAnd don't forget those nails. Regular nail trims should be part of every dog's grooming routine. Nails that get too long can cause pain and potentially lead to problems running or walking.\n\nLastly, good [dental hygiene](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) is essential to your pup's overall health. So, schedule professional cleanings and establish an at-home routine that includes regular teeth brushing and veterinarian-recommended dental chews.","care-exercise":"Like other hunting dogs, Pudelpointers need a fair amount of daily exercise. You can keep your pup active with long walks, hikes, and games of chase in the backyard. These dogs also love activities that play to their innate abilities, such as swimming and retrieving. But agility, rally, and competitive obedience are other great options.","care-training":"Pudelpointers are intelligent, eager-to-please dogs that are generally easy to train. A positive, reward-based approach using their favorite toys or treats will keep them engaged and responsive during training sessions.\n\nBe sure to [socialize your pup](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) when they're young to help them develop into a well-adjusted adult dog.","care-health":null,"references":"https://projectupland.com/hunting-dogs/pudelpointer-the-complete-versatile-hunting-dog-history/\n\nhttps://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/pudelpointer/\n\nhttp://www.fci.be/Nomenclature/Standards/216g07-en.pdf\n\nhttps://www.ukcdogs.com/pudelpointer","reviewed-by":"Jamie

Terrier","plural-name":"Rat Terriers","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The Rat Terrier breed started with Fox Terriers and various mixed terriers brought to the United States from England. And over time, breeders introduced other dogs to help them control different types of vermin.\n\nFor instance, breeders added [Whippets](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/whippet) to the Rat Terrier bloodline in the early 20th century to address a Kansas Jack Rabbit problem. They also incorporated [Beagles](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/beagle) to add pack instincts. These crosses gave the Rat Terrier a different temperament compared to other terriers, making the breed easier to live with and much less aggressive.\n\nPresident Theodore Roosevelt owned a Rat Terrier while he was in the White House. And more than a century later, these loving dogs continue to get our vote. The Rat Terrier received American Kennel Club recognition in 2013.","facts":"Rat Terriers are active, alert, and playful, with a more docile temperament than most terriers. If you're searching for an intelligent breed that forms close bonds with its family, look no further than the Rat Terrier.","traits-appearance":"Don't let the size of the Rat Terrier fool you—it's small but mighty! Rat Terriers have compact, well-balanced, and portable bodies. They also come in a miniature size.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Rat Terrier sports a variety of coat colors, usually consisting of a white, patched pattern called \"pied.\" The breed's coat is always short, smooth, and shiny.","traits-physical":"Rat Terriers have a smooth and wedge-shaped head, sharp features, and a small but muscular body.","temperament":"Rat Terriers have a reputation as good family pups. However, they may develop small dog syndrome—a behavioral problem where little dogs think they're in charge.\n\nA Rat Terrier with small dog syndrome might constantly bark, nip at strangers, or challenge their owners. Fortunately, firm and consistent correction—along with [early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization)—will help prevent these behaviors.\n\nMost Rat Terriers are easy-going around children, but they might be aloof with strangers. (Relatedly, they also make vigilant watchdogs without being too yappy.) Highly active, Rat Terriers need plenty of exercise and human companionship.","care-nutrition":"Rat Terriers need a high-quality food that's formulated for their age and size. Make sure to keep an eye on how much your Rat Terrier eats and reduce portions if your pup gains weight. Also, remember that giving too many treats in addition to regular meals can contribute to obesity.","care-grooming":"The short and dense coat of the Rat Terrier needs very little grooming to stay in good shape. A weekly sweep with a soft brush or hound glove should work well. Rat Terriers shed seasonally. A rubber brush or shedding tool will help during those times.\n\nAbout once a month, your Rat Terrier will likely need a bath and nail trim. Also, check your Rat Terrier's ears weekly to remove wax buildup or debris. Daily teeth brushing is also a good habit to maintain.","care-exercise":"Rat Terriers can often get enough exercise just from playing indoors. But outdoor activities—such as taking walks or chasing balls—are also important for your dog's mental and physical health. The breed also enjoys dog sports, including agility, obedience, and rally.\n\nBecause of their strong prey drive and tendency to chase, Rat Terriers should always be on a leash or in a secure, fenced-in area when outside.","care-training":"Rat Terriers are usually easy to train and eager to please. But they have a typical terrier temperament—which means they can sometimes be stubborn and independent. That said, Rat Terriers are remarkably perceptive and respond well to praise and positive obedience training methods.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Rat_Terriers/GhzPDAAAQBAJ\n\nhttps://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/rat-terrier/","reviewed-by":"Annette Louviere, DVM","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":4.5,"weight-range-pet-max":11.3,"weight-range-show-min":5.4,"weight-range-show-max":15.9,"height-range-min":25.0,"height-range-max":46.0,"life-span-range-min":12.0,"life-span-range-max":18.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":88,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":54,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":40},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9875b290-6058-54ca-a007-4e16ad4ef20b/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9875b290-6058-54ca-a007-4e16ad4ef20b/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9875b290-6058-54ca-a007-4e16ad4ef20b/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9875b290-6058-54ca-a007-4e16ad4ef20b/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9875b290-6058-54ca-a007-4e16ad4ef20b/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9875b290-6058-54ca-a007-4e16ad4ef20b/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9875b290-6058-54ca-a007-4e16ad4ef20b/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9875b290-6058-54ca-a007-4e16ad4ef20b/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9875b290-6058-54ca-a007-4e16ad4ef20b/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9875b290-6058-54ca-a007-4e16ad4ef20b/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9875b290-6058-54ca-a007-4e16ad4ef20b/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9875b290-6058-54ca-a007-4e16ad4ef20b/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9875b290-6058-54ca-a007-4e16ad4ef20b/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9875b290-6058-54ca-a007-4e16ad4ef20b/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9875b290-6058-54ca-a007-4e16ad4ef20b/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9875b290-6058-54ca-a007-4e16ad4ef20b/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9875b290-6058-54ca-a007-4e16ad4ef20b/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9875b290-6058-54ca-a007-4e16ad4ef20b/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"993b14f3-3ec9-5a34-b5e2-b0629f7a83e1","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/993b14f3-3ec9-5a34-b5e2-b0629f7a83e1"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"japanese-chin","name":"Japanese Chin","plural-name":"Japanese Chin","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The origin of the Japanese Chin is a mystery. Despite its name, the breed appears to have originated in China—or perhaps Korea. These small dogs served as companions, were bartered for goods, or given as gifts to traveling dignitaries. Eventually, they became a favorite breed of Imperial families, and they learned to appreciate the finer things in life.\n\nRegardless of where the Chin got its start, credit for developing the breed belongs to Japanese nobles. However, due to the isolationist policies that lasted until the mid-1800s, the Chin remained unknown outside of Japan. Once the borders reopened, the breed found homes around the world. Chins were unfazed in their new surroundings.\n\nThe Japanese Chin Club of America noted, \"The Japanese Chin lorded over his environment and cared not whether it was a 150-room palace or a three-room cottage: his concern was only that he was considered to be the most important object within and life catered to his every whim.\"\n\nJapanese Chins have retained their aristocratic attitudes and continue accepting the love and devotion of all of those who cross their paths.","facts":"Japanese Chins have a lot in common with cats. They're reserved and fastidious, groom themselves often, and move through life with a slightly superior attitude. Chins will even claim a favorite spot in the house to lie back and take in the world.","traits-appearance":"Japanese Chins are small dogs with delicate features and curious expressions. The breed is known for being light on its feet and having an \"aristocratic bearing\" that makes it both stylish and lively.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Abundant, straight, silky hair is one of the hallmarks of the breed. Japanese Chins have hair that stands out from their bodies, especially around their necks, shoulders, and chest areas, forming a ruff. Fine, silky hair covers their tails and forms a plume.\n\nJapanese Chins can be black and white, red and white, or black and white with tan points. Their red coloring includes all shades of red, orange, lemon, and sable. The tan points include tan or red spots over each eye, inside the ears, on both cheeks and, if the dog has any black, around the hind end.","traits-physical":"Though Japanese Chins are small in stature, their builds are solid, compact, and refined. They have large, wide-set eyes that are round and dark in color. Chins also have large, broad heads, small V-shaped ears, and short, broad muzzles.\n\nThe Japanese Chin's coat is its most distinctive trait. They have long fur covering their rumps, profuse feathering on the backs of their legs, and heavily feathered ears.","temperament":"Japanese Chins are good-natured, sensitive, and intelligent dogs. Their desire to give and receive affection—often on their terms—makes them ideal companions. Though Chins bond with their owners, the breed can be reserved with strangers and in new situations. They often prefer spending time at home, taking in the world through a coveted perch on the sofa.\n\nThese lap dogs are quiet, well-mannered, and meticulous, making them ideal for apartment life. Though Japanese Chins prefer indoor life, they still need regular exercise. And they can be stubborn, so training is a must.","care-nutrition":"Feed Japanese Chins a high-quality dog food that's appropriate for their age and breed size. To prevent them from becoming overweight, keep an eye on their food intake. Portion out their meals using a measuring cup to avoid over-feeding and limit treats to no more than 10% of their daily calories.","care-grooming":"These noble dogs appreciate looking their best. Despite their long hair, Japanese Chins don't require a lot of grooming. Regular baths and weekly brushing to remove dirt and mats are enough to keep their coats in tip-top shape. But just to be sure, Chins will sometimes groom themselves, licking their paws and rubbing their faces.\n\nJapanese Chins have fast-growing nails. Regular trims are required to keep them from cracking, splitting, or becoming painfully overgrown.\n\nEstablish a regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) routine that includes at-home teeth brushing as part of a lifelong dental hygiene program.","care-exercise":"Despite their lapdog statuses, Japanese Chins still need regular physical activity to burn off energy. Brisk walks, romps at the dog park, and games of fetch are great for providing mental and physical stimulation.\n\nThese little dogs have independent streaks and might not come when called, so limit off-leash play to enclosed areas.","care-training":"Training is a must. Japanese Chins were bred to be adorable and charming, not respond to commands. Their independent natures and cat-like personalities can make training a challenge.

Experts believe the Magyars brought these dogs with them when they first settled the Carpathian Basin around the 9th century.\n\nThough similar in appearance to the Greyhound, these dogs are a bit longer and stouter. As for their racing skills, the Magyar Agár has more endurance over longer distances. But it can't accelerate quite as fast as the Greyhound.\n\nBreeders crossed the two in the 19th and 20th centuries to add more endurance to the Greyhound bloodline and rekindle dwindling stocks of Magyar Agár after World War II. The United Kennel Club recognized the breed in 2006.","facts":"The Magyar Agár is a tough, fast sighthound with an endless supply of stamina. Though traditionally used for hunting, these dogs also make vigilant watchdogs and faithful companions.","traits-appearance":"The Magyar Agár is an elegant sighthound with a strong bone structure and well-developed muscles.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"This breed's short coat is dense, coarse, and smooth. Magyar Agárs develop a thick undercoat in the winter that protects them from harsh weather.\n\nThese dogs come in all colors and combinations. But blue, blue and white, brown, wolf grey, black and tan, and tri-color are considered eliminating faults by breed standards.","traits-physical":"The Magyar Agár has a wedge-shaped head, long muzzle, and elegant, muscular neck. The breed's dark eyes give an intelligent expression, and its rose ears are large and thick. These dogs also have a deep chest, well-arched ribs, tucked-up belly, and long, muscular legs.","temperament":"Magyar Agárs are friendly dogs that make wonderful pets for people with active lifestyles. Though they can be a bit reserved, these pups usually get along great with other dogs and kids. Their loyal, protective nature also makes them excellent watchdogs.\n\nThis breed does require careful socialization to prevent or reduce defensive or fear-based behaviors. Experiencing a wide variety of people, places, and situations when they're young will help them grow into happy, well-mannered adult dogs.\n\nThese racing dogs were born to chase—and that instinct is likely to take over when they encounter small pets or wildlife. So, exercise caution when little critters are around.","care-nutrition":"Magyar Agárs need high-quality food appropriate for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior), breed size, and activity level.\n\nBecause of their deep chests, these dogs may be more prone to bloat (also known as twisted stomach). To help prevent this condition, break your dog's food up into several meals a day, and use a food bowl specially designed to slow their eating. When timing meals, avoid feeding your pup immediately before or after any vigorous activity.\n\nThese are just a few ways you can help prevent this life-threatening condition. Ask your veterinarian about other ways—including surgical options—to prevent bloat.","care-grooming":"This breed's short coat doesn't require much maintenance. For most of the year, weekly brushing will do the trick. In the winter—when Magyar Agárs have their dense undercoats—you may need to brush more frequently.\n\nTrimming nails, cleaning ears, and brushing teeth should also be part of every dog's grooming routine, regardless of breed.","care-exercise":"Magyar Agárs do like to spend a large part of the day napping. But they are still active dogs that require plenty of exercise. Daily long, brisk walks and opportunities to run in a fenced yard or alongside a bike are ideal. This breed also seems to enjoy dog sports—such as lure coursing, racing, agility, and competitive obedience.","care-training":"Intelligent dogs that love to learn, Magyar Agárs are relatively easy to train—especially if you start basic obedience at a young age. For successful training sessions, stay positive and use reward-based methods.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.ukcdogs.com/hungarian-greyhound-magyar-agar\n\nhttp://www.magyaragar.org/breed.html\n","reviewed-by":"Jamie Freyer,

Apso","plural-name":"Lhasa Apsos","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The Lhasa Apso can trace its roots to Lhasa, the provincial capital of Tibet, China. In 800 B.C., monks from Tibetan monasteries raised these fearless and assertive dogs, keeping them indoors as second lines of defense against intruders. They barked at any sign of trouble, earning these protectors the name Abso Seng Kye, which means \"bark lion sentinel dog.\"\n\nThe breed also has a sacred meaning in Tibetan folklore. According to ancient stories, the souls of llamas entered the dogs' bodies after death, giving them special reverence. The monks who kept Lhasa Apsos believed that to be in their presence was to be blessed with good fortune.\n\nThe so-called \"bearded lion dog\" was also believed to represent the snow lion, the protector of Tibet. Their cultural significance has led to a longstanding association between the Lhasa Apso and the Dalai Lama. In the late 1940s, the Fourteenth Dalai Lama, a Lhasa breeder, helped establish the breed in the United States, offering dogs that he bred as gifts.\n\nThe AKC initially classified the breed as a terrier, but it later reassigned it to the non-sporting group. The Lhasa Apso is one of the most ancient breeds recognized by the AKC.","facts":"Lhasa Apsos are smart, sensitive, and outgoing dogs. Their fearless personalities and keen sense of hearing make these small-but-confident dogs popular guardians. They will alert their owners at the first signs of trouble (or the mailman).","traits-appearance":"Lhasa Apsos are small, well-balanced, rectangular-shaped dogs. True to their Tibetan heritage, the breed is said to have aristocratic bearings, a thoughtful expression, and a smooth, effortless gait.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"This double-coated breed has heavy and straight—but not woolly or silky—long hair. All colors are acceptable and common coloring includes black, black and tan, cream, golden, grizzle, red, red gold, and white.","traits-physical":"Lhasa Apsos have dark brown, almond-shaped eyes, pendular, heavily feathered ears, and well-feathered tails that are set high and carried over their backs, curling to the sides.\n\nOther notable traits are the Lhasa's head furnishings—longer hair that falls over their eyes—and their cute beard and whiskers.","temperament":"Lhasa Apsos have regal attitudes that make them appear both elegant and serious. These dogs are outgoing, comical, and charming with their owners.\n\nThanks to their watchdog roots, Lhasas require [socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) to reduce or prevent their aggressive tendencies. Because they're alert and want to protect their people, they often bark if something strikes them as a potential danger. Training can help them tell the difference between typical household sounds and noises that could signal trouble. If well-trained, they can be quiet, respectful apartment dogs.\n\nTheir confident, outgoing personalities make Lhasas great therapy dogs. They're good with children and other pets. However, they need supervision around young children and big dogs due to their small size.\n\nThese independent dogs rarely suffer from separation anxiety, making them excellent companions for people who work during the day.","care-nutrition":"Choose a high-quality dog food that's appropriate for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). A diet formulated for small breeds is a good option to consider. Overfeeding Lhasa Apsos can cause digestive upset. Portion out their food using a standard measuring cup and limit treats to no more than 10% of their daily calories to prevent overfeeding.","care-grooming":"Whether their coats are left long or trimmed into a \"puppy cut,\" Lhasas require regular grooming. Professional groomers will trim their hair and add clips to keep it out of their eyes.\n\nAt home, bathe Lhasas at least twice per month and use conditioners to make grooming easier. After a bath, dry the hair completely (leaving it damp can cause painful matting) and brush it thoroughly. Brushing Lhasas at least once a week helps remove dirt and mats. Starting a grooming routine when they're puppies will help them get used to the process.\n\nBe sure to keep their nails trimmed. Overly long nails can cause pain or lead to problems running or walking. Start a regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) routine that includes at-home teeth brushing when Lhaso Apsos are young. Good dental hygiene is an essential part of their lifelong care.","care-exercise":"These one-time watchdogs require little exercise. A brisk walk around the block is enough to tire a Lhasa Apso out. This breed is also good at \"self-exercise\" and will happily explore a fenced yard or play with toys to burn off their energy. Lhasas excel at agility, and some even retrieve and herd.","care-training":"These outgoing, friendly dogs can also be stubborn and independent. That stubborn streak may come out during training. So, while Lhasa Apsos can be quick learners, they may choose not to follow directions.\n\nKeeping training activities short and fun can help hold their attention. Use positive praise and rewards to encourage these willful dogs to learn (and follow) basic commands.

Experts believe ancient Egyptians tamed these wild cats and used them to protect their grain supplies from rodents 10,000 years ago.\n\nPeople in Egypt worshipped cats and considered them sacred. In addition to depicting them in ancient artwork, they presented mummified cats as offerings to the cat goddess Bastet. Remains of some pet cats were even buried in tombs alongside their owners, with the hope they would remain together in the afterlife.\n\nThough cats in Egypt today are not as revered, many still consider them beloved companions. In addition to pet cats, street cats are plentiful in Egypt—particularly in busy cities such as Cairo. And some people believe the ancestors of cats that lived with pharaohs still roam Egyptian streets.","facts":"Egyptian street cats are domesticated cats that live independently in cities and villages throughout Egypt.","traits-appearance":"Egyptian street cats come in all shapes and sizes. Signs of a life-long street cat—versus a stray cat who may be lost—include a clean, well-kept coat, protective body language, and lack of eye contact. Because they are intact, male street cats may have thick necks, muscular bodies, and scars from fighting.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The coat of the Egyptian street cat is typically short and can come in all colors and patterns.","traits-physical":"Because they do not follow a breed standard, Egyptian street cats may have any combination of physical features.","temperament":"Egyptian street cats often live in groups and congregate near food sources and shelter. Though they may live in densely populated cities or towns, they are not typically accustomed to human contact. Some are fearful of being handled or confined. But others can adapt to interactions with people and learn to live indoors.","care-nutrition":"An Egyptian street cat's diet typically consists of whatever they can find—scraps from trash cans, birds and rodents, handouts from kind strangers, and so on. If you're leaving food out for a street cat, they will benefit from the same commercially prepared diets as pet cats.","care-grooming":"Street cats are typically meticulous self-groomers that keep their coats relatively clean. If you've taken in a street cat that will tolerate it, regular brushing and nail trims will help keep them in tip-top shape.","care-exercise":null,"care-training":null,"care-health":"Egyptian street cats are susceptible to the same diseases as pet cats—including rabies, distemper, feline immunodeficiency virus, and feline leukemia. They are also at risk for numerous internal and external parasites and health issues associated with poor nutrition.","references":"https://bigcatswildcats.com/african-wildcat/\n\nhttps://carnegiemnh.org/why-were-cats-mummified-in-ancient-egypt/\n\nhttps://www.alleycat.org/resources/feral-and-stray-cats-an-important-difference/\n\nhttps://icatcare.org/unowned-cats/the-different-needs-of-domestic-cats/\n\nhttps://www.knowyourcat.info/lib/feralcats.htm\n\nhttps://www.humanesociety.org/sites/default/files/docs/caring-community-cats-overview.pdf","reviewed-by":"Annette

Fox Terrier","plural-name":"Wire Fox Terriers","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The Wire Fox Terrier dates back to the 1800s. The breed descended from the now-extinct Rough-Coated Black-and-Tan Terrier of Wales, Derbyshire, and Durham. This ancestor assisted in fox hunts by tracking foxes, guiding the hunters, and then driving the foxes from their dens.\n\nWire Fox Terriers grew popular during the 1930s after being featured in the popular \"Thin Man\" series of movies and in \"The Adventures of Tintin\" comic strip. But in later years, the breed's population decreased as more people moved from the country into cities.\n\nThe American Kennel Club recognized the Wire Fox Terrier in 1885. But it wasn't until 1985 that the club formally recognized it as separate from the [Smooth Fox Terrier](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/fox-terrier-smooth).","facts":"Good-natured, playful, and feisty, the Wire Fox Terrier makes a great sidekick and companion. They are loving and affectionate with family and excellent with older children. Alert and fearless, Wire Fox Terriers also love chasing rats and foxes (hence the name).","traits-appearance":"Wire Fox Terriers have a generally happy, animated, and lively appearance.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Wire Fox Terrier's wiry coat is predominantly white with patches of black, tan, or combinations of black and tan. Solid white coats are also possible.","traits-physical":"The Wire Fox Terrier has a dense but wiry coat that's ideally crinkly or slightly wavy.","temperament":"Wire Fox Terriers are determined dogs that always want to be on the go. Agile and energetic, these pups fit perfectly in an active family.\n\nTypical of many terriers, the Wire Fox Terrier might not get along well with other dogs and loves to bark, dig, and chase wildlife. These tenacious dogs can also be challenging to distract once they're engaged in an activity.\n\nTrue to their breed, Wire Fox Terriers have rambunctious personalities and great enthusiasm and courage. Despite their small size, these dogs are not couch potatoes—they are far too busy to sit on a lap.","care-nutrition":"The Wire Fox Terrier needs high-quality, age-appropriate dog food. All dogs run the risk of obesity if they eat too many calories. So, keep an eye on how much your Wire Fox Terrier eats, and reduce portions if your pup gains weight. Also, remember that giving too many treats in addition to regular meals can contribute to obesity.","care-grooming":"The grooming needs of Wire Fox Terriers can vary. The coats of show dogs should be hand-stripped. But average pets can have their coats clipped, which requires much less effort. Either way, this breed requires regular brushing to avoid matting.\n\nMonthly nail trims are a great habit to get into, along with weekly ear checks for wax buildup and debris.","care-exercise":"Wire Fox Terriers have an insatiable amount of energy. They are up for almost anything, whether it's taking a long walk, chasing a ball, or playing games in a (fenced) yard. Wire Fox Terriers also enjoy dog sports such as agility, flyball, tracking, and earthdog trials.\n\nYou should leash your Wire Fox Terrier whenever they're in an unenclosed area. If their prey instinct kicks in, you might find them chasing rabbits, birds, cats, and even other dogs instead of a ball.","care-training":"Wire Fox Terriers are very intelligent and relatively easy to train—though they can sometimes be stubborn and willful. Experts recommend starting firm, consistent, and gentle training from an early age.\n\nThese pups learn fast. But they get bored fast, too. So, avoid repetitive tasks and use upbeat, reward-based training methods for this breed.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Fox_Terrier/2rUJBgAAQBAJ\n\nhttps://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/wire-fox-terrier/","reviewed-by":"Annette Louviere,

Terrier","plural-name":"Biewer-Terriers","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The Biewer Terriers are a breed named after the couple that started their line: Werner and Gertrud Biewer. The Biewers loved their animals, and throughout the 1970s and into the early 1980s, they had a successful Yorkshire Terrier breeding program. On January 20, 1984, the first documented black, white, and tan Yorkshire puppy was born into their pack, and three months later, another arrived. These rare puppies possessed the piebald gene not usually found in Yorkies.\n\nThey eventually settled on the name Biewer Yorkshire Terrier. Margo Eskens, a German singer, purchased the unique puppies and renamed them the Biewer Yorkshire Terrier a la Pom Pon. This new breed made its debut to the public in 1986.\n\nBecause of their popularity, the Biewers couldn’t keep up with the business of breeding their namesake terriers, though other breeders have worked to replicate the same type of dog.\n\nSince this is a relatively new breed, there are no specific standards for the Biewer Terrier.","facts":"This small breed is intelligent and devoted, and they make great companions for families. They can be mischievous, but they quickly make friends with any people they meet, as well as other dogs and animals.They are mellower than other terrier breeds, and while they do still require some exercise and mental stimulation, a game of fetch or short walk is plenty for the Biewer.","traits-appearance":"The Biewer Terrier has an elegant, longhaired coat that parts down the middle. They have a level back, with a high-set, plumed tail.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Biewer Terrier has a long and flowing coat that’s silky in texture. Their coloring comes in any combination of black or blue with gold or tan, as well as white.","traits-physical":"This breed is known for its long, silky, flowing coat, but it was the coat’s color that caught the attention of the original Biewer breeders, Mr. and Mrs. Biewer. These rare puppies possessed the piebald gene—not usually found in their ancestor, the Yorkie—and it exhibited itself as a black, white, and tan dog. Today, the breed continues to have a unique color scheme, including blue/black, gold/tan, and white.","temperament":"The Biewer Terrier is a real companion dog. Although they have a mischievous, childlike curiosity, they are relatively easy to train, and they tend to be mellow and easygoing, which makes them an excellent option for families.\n\nThey get along well with other animals, and their fun-loving attitude is easy to love.","care-nutrition":"The Biewer Terrier does best with high-quality dog food that’s suited to their particular age, as well as any additional health concerns. Consider a small-breed food for this breed.\n\nAs with any dog, it’s important to monitor the amount of food and treats that you give your Biewer Terrier, especially since some dogs may be prone to gaining weight as they age. Your veterinarian is always a good source to help provide you with appropriate nutrition and feeding guidelines.","care-grooming":"The Biewer Terrier’s long, silky coat requires more care than other terriers. Daily brushing should help keep mats and loose hairs at bay. You can also keep your Biewer’s coat shorter, which will require less care.\n\nAll dogs require regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care), including at-home teeth brushing and professional dental cleanings, and the Biewer Terrier is no exception. Maintaining good dental hygiene is important for their overall long-term health.","care-exercise":"These small dogs are easy-going, including when it comes to their exercise routine. Unlike other terriers, they tend to be pretty mellow, and a game of fetch or short walk will be plenty to keep them healthy and happy.","care-training":"Dedicated, loyal, and smart, the Biewer Terrier is both easy to please and

Hound","plural-name":"Qingchuan Hounds","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"Native to the Guangyuan region of Sichuan, Qingchuan Hounds likely resulted from the crossing of Liangshan hunting dogs and local dogs in the semi-rural Qingchuan County. These mountain dogs are known for their speed, endurance, and skill at hunting in groups.","facts":"Qingchuan Hounds are powerful, fierce mountain dogs that make excellent hunting buddies.","traits-appearance":"Qingchuan Hounds are medium-sized dogs with deep chests, slender legs, and well-developed muscles.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Qingchuan's short- or medium-length coat can adapt to various climates. It typically consists of a thick, short, light-colored undercoat and longer, dark-bristled outer coat. All coat colors are possible, but blue, white, brown, and black are the most common.","traits-physical":"Qingchuan Hounds' heads are shaped like inverted triangles, and their large ears droop forward to the cheek. Their eyes are small, almond-shaped, and usually a brownish-red color.","temperament":"These cooperative, flexible hunting dogs work well both in groups and independently. They possess the speed and endurance to hunt for hours or even days on end. In addition to their keen hunting skills, Qingchuan are devoted to their people and make excellent guard dogs.","care-nutrition":"Qingchuan Hounds thrive on a high-quality diet formulated for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). To help your pup maintain a healthy weight, keep an eye on their food intake and measure their portions to avoid overfeeding. And don't forget to account for treats. As a guideline, they should make up no more than 10% of a dog's daily calories.","care-grooming":"The Qingchuan's thick double coat requires brushing a couple of times a week to remove loose fur. During periods of seasonal shedding, your dog may need more frequent brushing. Regular nail trims and ear cleanings should also be part of their grooming routine.\n\nGood [dental hygiene](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) is essential to the health of any dog. Dental disease is among the most common health conditions in adult dogs. Left untreated, it can contribute to other serious issues. So, in addition to professional cleanings, establish an at-home dental care program that includes regular teeth brushing and veterinarian-recommended dental chews.","care-exercise":"Qingchuan are energetic dogs that need plenty of daily exercise. Long walks, hikes, and play sessions in a fenced backyard are all wonderful ways to keep your dog active. Because of their strong hunting instincts, Qingchuan should remain in a secured area or on a leash when outside.","care-training":"This breed responds well to firm and consistent training using positive reinforcement and rewards. And [socializing your pup](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) when they're young will help them develop into a well-mannered adult dog.","care-health":null,"references":"https://baike.baidu.com/item/青川犬","reviewed-by":"Laura Inman,

in Belgium in the 1600s, the Schipperke (often pronounced \"SKIP-er-kee\") descended from a black sheepdog known as Leauvenaar. Back in the day, Schipperkes often worked aboard barges. Their jobs included catching vermin, nipping at the heels of tow horses, and serving as watchdogs. The Schipperke appears to be among the few breeds that do not suffer from seasickness. As a result, it remains a popular sailing companion.\n\nFirst called Spitzke, this breed earned a new name in 1888 to honor its seafaring ways—Schipperke means \"little captain.\" Schipperkes first appeared in a dog show in 1880, and their adorable features and outgoing personalities made them an instant hit. Soon, Belgium was exporting the dogs to breeders throughout the world.","facts":"The Schipperke is a small, powerful breed. These curious little explorers have tenacious personalities and make excellent pets for active families.","traits-appearance":"These active, agile watchdogs have small, thickset bodies, and black fur. Schipperkes have mischievous, alert expressions and move with graceful trots.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Schipperkes have distinct, black coats with several different lengths of hair. On the face, ears, front of the forelegs, and the hocks, the hair is short. But it is medium-length on the body. And on the ruff, cape, culottes, and jabot (the center of the chest, extending down between the front legs), it's long.\n\nThe Schipperke's hair growth pattern is also specific. Down the middle of the breed's back—starting behind the cape and continuing over the rump—the hair lies flat.\n\nSchipperkes are double-coated. Their undercoats are short, soft, and denser around the ruff. This causes the straight, abundant topcoat—which is slightly harsh to the touch—to stand out. The Schipperke's coat should not be silky.","traits-physical":"Schipperkes are square-bodied with broad, deep chests, well-sprung ribs, and short, muscular loins. Their fox-like faces have small, oval, dark brown eyes, small, triangular, erect ears, and little, black noses.","temperament":"Schipperkes are inquisitive and love exploring. Though outgoing and affectionate with their people (including children), these dogs can be reserved with strangers.\n\nConfident, attentive personalities—along with a tendency to bark at the first sign of trouble—make Schipperkes excellent watchdogs. But for the same reason, they may not be the best choice for apartment-dwelling pet parents.\n\nSchipperkes thrive among active families that invite them to tag along for outdoor activities. With a strong prey drive, this breed might chase birds, rodents, and other small animals. So, you should only let your Schipperke off-leash in securely fenced areas.","care-nutrition":"Schipperkes need a high-quality dog food appropriate for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). Consider a diet formulated for small, active breeds. To prevent weight-related health issues, measure out your dog's meals, and limit treats to no more than 10% of their daily calories.","care-grooming":"Schipperkes have minimal grooming needs—bathing and brushing every so often is usually adequate. That said, their double coats will need extra attention during spring and fall. Daily brushing during these times can help remove cast-off undercoats, helping your Schipperke look their best.\n\nTrimming nails, cleaning ears, and [brushing teeth](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) should also be part of every dog's grooming routine, regardless of breed.","care-exercise":"Schipperkes are an active breed that requires a lot of exercise. Fortunately, regular walks or play sessions in the backyard will quickly tire out these small dogs. Schipperkes also seem to enjoy canine sport—such as rally, agility, flyball, and competitive obedience.\n\nDon't let your Schipperke off-leash unless there is a secure fence. Otherwise, the little explorer may wander off and ignore commands to come back.","care-training":"The Schipperke's active and independent nature may cause this breed to follow its instincts instead of responding to commands. So, training can be a challenge, and patience and persistence are key. With regular reinforcement, your pup will pick up basic commands, new tricks, and establish positive habits—such as reduced barking.\n\nTraining also provides much-needed physical and mental stimulation. Fast-paced games and puzzles appeal to this intelligent breed. So, keep your Schipperke engaged with high-speed, interesting activities. Positive, rewards-based training—offering treats, toys, and praise instead of harsh criticism—also works well. Finally, don't forget [socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization), which will help your Schipperke feel confident around unfamiliar people, pets, and situations.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/schipperke/\n\nhttps://www.akc.org/expert-advice/lifestyle/what-was-the-schipperke-bred-to-do/\n\nhttp://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/Schipperke.pdf","reviewed-by":"Cindy Elston, DVM, MPH","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":4.1,"weight-range-pet-max":8.6,"weight-range-show-min":2.7,"weight-range-show-max":8.2,"height-range-min":23.0,"height-range-max":36.0,"life-span-range-min":12.0,"life-span-range-max":15.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":111,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":64,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":45},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9d02b0b8-e189-506a-b8a8-6adbb376d258/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9d02b0b8-e189-506a-b8a8-6adbb376d258/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9d02b0b8-e189-506a-b8a8-6adbb376d258/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9d02b0b8-e189-506a-b8a8-6adbb376d258/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9d02b0b8-e189-506a-b8a8-6adbb376d258/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9d02b0b8-e189-506a-b8a8-6adbb376d258/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9d02b0b8-e189-506a-b8a8-6adbb376d258/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9d02b0b8-e189-506a-b8a8-6adbb376d258/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9d02b0b8-e189-506a-b8a8-6adbb376d258/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9d02b0b8-e189-506a-b8a8-6adbb376d258/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9d02b0b8-e189-506a-b8a8-6adbb376d258/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9d02b0b8-e189-506a-b8a8-6adbb376d258/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9d02b0b8-e189-506a-b8a8-6adbb376d258/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9d02b0b8-e189-506a-b8a8-6adbb376d258/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9d02b0b8-e189-506a-b8a8-6adbb376d258/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9d02b0b8-e189-506a-b8a8-6adbb376d258/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9d02b0b8-e189-506a-b8a8-6adbb376d258/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9d02b0b8-e189-506a-b8a8-6adbb376d258/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"9d718167-5b7a-590e-9208-d08a7803afa7","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9d718167-5b7a-590e-9208-d08a7803afa7"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"eurasier","name":"Eurasier","plural-name":"Eurasiers","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The Eurasier is a relatively new breed. In 1960, a German breeder named Julius Wipfel aimed to create a canine that was as adaptable as a wolf but as good-natured and social as a family dog.\n\nWipfel began by crossing a [Chow Chow](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/chow-chow) and Wolfspitz to create the Wolf-Chow. And in 1972, he mixed the Wolf-Chow with the [Samoyed](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/samoyed), yielding the Eurasier.\n\nThough the breed is well-known in Germany and other parts of Europe, it remains rare in the United States.","facts":"The Eurasier is a fun-loving family dog. Calm, even-tempered, and affectionate, they desire close connections with their people. And this breed's playful, easygoing nature also makes it a good companion for children.","traits-appearance":"A medium-sized dog, the Eurasier has a thick coat and erect ears.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Eurasiers have medium-length coats with thick undercoats. And they can be many colors. But the most common are black, fawn, red, sable, and gray.\n\nPure white and irregular white patches are not permitted in the breed standards. Black markings—including face masks or reverse face masks—are common.","traits-physical":"One of the more unusual traits of Eurasiers is their purple, pink, or spotted tongues.","temperament":"Self-assured, calm, and even-tempered, Eurasiers are devoted to their owners and thrive on affection and attention. In fact, nothing would make them happier than living in a household where someone is home all day. They should never be chained up outside or left alone.\n\nThis breed is great with children—especially when raised in a family setting—and other dogs. Eurasiers can be wary of strangers, but they aren't aggressive and don't make good guard dogs.","care-nutrition":"Eurasiers require a high-quality, age-appropriate dog food–whether it's commercially manufactured or homemade (with a veterinarian's supervision and approval). These dogs are known to be picky eaters. Offering a variety of different foods can help prevent your dog from getting bored and refusing to eat.","care-grooming":"This breed's shaggy coat needs regular grooming. Expect to brush your Eurasier at least once a week, and be sure to check for matted fur. Frequent grooming can help remove dead hair.\n\nEurasiers that have been spayed or neutered tend to have thicker, longer coats that require additional maintenance. Twice a year, Eurasiera shed their undercoats. Daily brushing during these seasonal periods is key.\n\nTrimming nails, cleaning ears, and [brushing teeth](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) should also be part of your Eurasier's grooming routine.","care-exercise":"In the home, Eurasiers can be couch potatoes—curling up alongside their people for long naps. But these dogs still need regular exercise. They love long walks, swimming, and canine sports—such as agility, flyball, rally, and competitive obedience. Well-trained Eurasiers often behave off-leash, making them perfect tagalongs for hikes and other outdoor adventures.\n\nWith good-natured personalities and love for other dogs, Eurasiers are a great breed to take to the dog park or drop off at daycare. And because they don't have extreme exercise needs, Eurasiers are well-suited for apartment living.","care-training":"Training an eager-to-please breed like the Eurasier is a breeze. Though sometimes independent, Eurasiers have a strong desire for praise and affection.

Though they once roamed the continent at large, they now primarily live in the savannas of central and southern Africa. Servals thrive in grassy areas near streams and rivers—where they have ample opportunity to show off their keen hunting skills.\n\nThe Serval's name comes from the Portuguese word meaning \"deerlike wolf.\" They appeared in ancient Egyptian art and were given as exotic gifts by Egyptian rulers. These wild cats were also the symbol on the Italian Tomasi family coat of arms in the 1800s. Despite being widely translated as \"The Leopard,\" author Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa's famous historical novel \"Il Gattopardo\"\n\nHumans have long been fascinated by the prospect of keeping wild animals as pets. To create the \"best of both worlds,\" breeder Suzi Wood began crossing Servals with Domestic cats in 1986. The resulting breed—the Savannah—has a spotted Serval appearance with a domestic cat's temperament.\n\nIn some places, people are allowed to own Servals. These cats may be many generations removed from African Servals but are still subject to restrictions regarding ownership of exotic animals.","facts":"Servals are beautifully spotted cats with long bodies and oversized ears.

They also have small heads, elongated necks, long slender bodies, and short tails.","temperament":"Servals are solitary animals. They interact with fellow Servals only when mating or when females are raising their kittens. But if kept as pets, they may form bonds with humans and be affectionate if handled appropriately from a young age. However, they are not likely to display the same level of comfort with strangers.\n\nServals use urine marking to identify their territory, and—even if litterbox trained— this is a habit not easily broken. Their vocalizations can include long yowls, shrill cries, purrs, and growls.\n\nLike any wild cat, captive Servals require large, outdoor enclosures that allow them to roam freely. They can jump up to nine feet in the air and dig beneath fencing, so the enclosure should have both a top and sides that extend a few feet below ground.","care-nutrition":"Servals eat a varied diet of birds, rodents, insects, frogs, and reptiles.","care-grooming":"The Serval's short coat doesn't require a lot of grooming. If comfortable being handled, Servals should have their nails trimmed to protect others from swats and scratches.","care-exercise":null,"care-training":null,"care-health":"Servals need many of the same vaccinations and preventive care as domestic cats.

But when local ranchers started importing [Border Collies](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/border-collie), the Berger d'Auvergne's popularity began to fade. By 2010, the breed was so rare that some considered it extinct.\n\nAuvergne locals set out to save the dogs. With the support of Professor Jean-François Courreau of the National Veterinary School of Alfort, they rounded up the remaining Berger d'Auvergnes from farms to re-establish the breed. Today, these dogs remain extremely rare. But committed breeders are still working to preserve them.","facts":"The Berger d'Auvergne is an intelligent, versatile working dog. Assertive but friendly, these pups enjoy an active life outdoors.","traits-appearance":"Berger d'Auvergnes are medium-sized dogs with a solid build and rustic appearance.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Berger d'Auvergne's coat is thick and rough. It's typically short-to-medium in length and comes in various colors and patterns—including light fawn, black and tan, and merle.","traits-physical":"Berger d'Auvergnes have narrow heads and tapered muzzles. They usually carry their triangular ears semi-erect, though they can be straight or drooping. This breed's round, expressive eyes come in yellow, orange, hazelnut, blue, and particolor.","temperament":"Confident and kind, Berger d'Auvergnes enjoy spending time with their humans. But some may be reserved or even wary of strangers. This breed is happiest when living an active life with plenty of outdoor time.","care-nutrition":"Berger d'Auvergnes thrive on a high-quality diet formulated for their life stage and energy level. To help your dog maintain a healthy weight, keep an eye on their food intake and measure their portions to avoid overfeeding. And remember, as a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of a dog's daily calories.","care-grooming":"The Berger d'Auvergne's grooming needs are relatively minimal. Weekly brushing to remove loose fur and dirt from their coats will keep them looking their best. Regular nail trims should also be part of their grooming routine, as overgrown nails can cause pain and potentially lead to problems running or walking.\n\nGood [dental hygiene](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) is another essential part of your pup's long-term care. Dental disease is one of the most common conditions in adult dogs. And, left untreated, it can contribute to other serious health issues. Professional cleanings combined with regular at-home teeth brushing will help keep your dog's smile bright and healthy.","care-exercise":"True to their herding dog roots, Berger d'Auvergnes are energetic dogs that need a lot of daily exercise. Long walks (or better yet, runs) will help them burn energy and stay in shape. These athletic dogs are also well-suited for activities such as agility, rally, and competitive obedience.","care-training":"Berger d'Auvergnes are highly trainable thanks to their high intelligence. But they can also be independently minded. So, firm, consistent training methods work best. Lastly, [socializing](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) your Berger d'Auvergne as a puppy will help them develop into a well-mannered adult

eye color into the American Shorthair line. Though this effort produced beautiful cats, they didn't necessarily look like true American Shorthairs. Rather than muddy the existing breed standard, Jane Martinke decided to develop a new breed entirely.\n\nThe name proposed for this new breed—a silver, short-coated cat that resembled a Persian—was \"Sterling.\" But the one that ultimately stuck was \"Exotic Shorthair,\" and the breed standard included all Persian colors.\n\nAround the same time, another cat breeder named Carolyn Bussey set out to develop a brown Persian. She bred a red tabby Persian and a Burmese and—because brown is a recessive gene—ended up with a litter of black kittens. But those kittens inspired her to create a shorthaired Persian.\n\nSo, when the Cat Fanciers Association accepted the Exotic Shorthair breed, Bussey had a headstart breeding these adorable new cats. Still, Exotics developed slowly at first because Persian breeders were hesitant to have their cats contribute to the new breed line.\n\nFortunately, the appeal of the Exotic became impossible to resist. And the Exotic Shorthair is now one of the most popular cat breeds in the world.","facts":"If you love Persians' distinctive look but could do without their high-maintenance coats, the Exotic Shorthair is the breed for you.

They are well-balanced with round lines and sweet expressions.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Move over, teddy bears. Exotics may just have the cuddliest plush coats around. Their dense, soft hair is medium in length with a thick undercoat. They come in an assortment of coat colors and patterns—including solid, bicolor, calico, tortoiseshell, tabby, shaded, smoke, and pointed.","traits-physical":"If there's a theme to the Exotic's overall appearance, it's \"round.\" These cats have massive, round heads, round faces, round, full eyes, rounded tips on their small ears, and large, round paws.\n\nLike Persians, they also have short, snub noses with a break between the eyes. Exotics have short and thick legs, and they carry their tails at an angle lower than their backs.","temperament":"Exotics are calm, affectionate cats that usually get along with everyone in the home, including other pets and kids. This quiet breed is likely to get your attention by gazing at you with their sweet expressions. But when they decide to be vocal, they use a soft, musical chirp.\n\nDespite their low-key energy, Exotics have a curious, playful nature. They love to chase balls and pounce on toys. But when it's time to relax, they will happily crawl into your lap. Some Exotics even sit on their human's shoulder. Though they love attention, they aren't overly demanding when you need your own space.","care-nutrition":"Exotics benefit from a high-quality diet appropriate for their life stage (e.g., kitten, adult, senior). Obesity is a growing health concern for cats, so it's important to carefully monitor their food intake. To avoid overfeeding, use a standard measuring cup to portion out their meals and reduce amounts if your cat gains weight. And as a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of their daily calories.\n\nIn addition to meals, make sure to provide your cat with plenty of fresh, clean water.","care-grooming":"An Exotic's grooming needs are minimal compared to those of a Persian. Just comb your cat weekly and wipe their eyes to remove any dust or debris.\n\nTheir nails also require monthly trimming. Nails that get too long can snag on something and become torn or damaged. Long nails can also grow into your cat's paw pads, leading to pain or infection.\n\nLastly, establish a regular oral hygiene routine that includes at-home teeth brushing and professional dental cleanings.","care-exercise":null,"care-training":null,"care-health":"Exotics are a brachycephalic breed. That means they have physical features—such as a flat face, short nose, and wide skull—that may cause health issues. Potential challenges include breathing difficulties, heat sensitivity, jaw deformities that lead to dental disease, trouble eating or drinking, and skin or eye issues.\n\nExotics may also be more prone to developing Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy. This condition decreases the heart's efficiency and can lead to other issues. Talk with your veterinarian about ways you can manage or minimize the health risks of your Persian cat.","references":"https://cfa.org/exotic/exotic-article/\n\nhttps://cfa.org/cfa-news-releases/top-breeds-2019/\n\nhttps://www.tica.org/breeds/browse-all-breeds?view=article&id=841:exotic-shorthair-breed&catid=79\n\nhttps://cfa.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/exotic-standard.pdf\n\nhttps://cfa.org/exotic/","reviewed-by":"Annette Louviere, DVM","date-reviewed":"2021-02-23T00:03:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":3.2,"weight-range-pet-max":5.4,"weight-range-show-min":null,"weight-range-show-max":null,"height-range-min":null,"height-range-max":null,"life-span-range-min":12.0,"life-span-range-max":15.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":null,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":null,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":null},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9e2ca158-e2ae-5bce-a270-3f4b70129dcd/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9e2ca158-e2ae-5bce-a270-3f4b70129dcd/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9e2ca158-e2ae-5bce-a270-3f4b70129dcd/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9e2ca158-e2ae-5bce-a270-3f4b70129dcd/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9e2ca158-e2ae-5bce-a270-3f4b70129dcd/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9e2ca158-e2ae-5bce-a270-3f4b70129dcd/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9e2ca158-e2ae-5bce-a270-3f4b70129dcd/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9e2ca158-e2ae-5bce-a270-3f4b70129dcd/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9e2ca158-e2ae-5bce-a270-3f4b70129dcd/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9e2ca158-e2ae-5bce-a270-3f4b70129dcd/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9e2ca158-e2ae-5bce-a270-3f4b70129dcd/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9e2ca158-e2ae-5bce-a270-3f4b70129dcd/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9e2ca158-e2ae-5bce-a270-3f4b70129dcd/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9e2ca158-e2ae-5bce-a270-3f4b70129dcd/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9e2ca158-e2ae-5bce-a270-3f4b70129dcd/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9e2ca158-e2ae-5bce-a270-3f4b70129dcd/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9e2ca158-e2ae-5bce-a270-3f4b70129dcd/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9e2ca158-e2ae-5bce-a270-3f4b70129dcd/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"9e5f8c78-0ce3-5ff5-9ac8-98e7597f0847","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9e5f8c78-0ce3-5ff5-9ac8-98e7597f0847"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"italian-greyhound","name":"Italian Greyhound","plural-name":"Italian Greyhounds","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"Traced back almost 2000 years, the Italian Greyhound has a past full of nobility and aristocracy. It began as a small-game hunter in southern Europe and found its prominence and namesake in Italy during the Renaissance.\n\nIn the 16th century owning an Italian Greyhound was a mark of wealth and status. Seen in many paintings during the Renaissance, the dog perfectly embodied the era’s noble aesthetic. These dogs have been treasured pets of famous royalty ever since, including James I, Frederick the Great, Catherine the Great, Anne of Denmark, and Queen Victoria.","facts":"Smaller, slender versions of their larger relative, the Greyhound, these sleek dogs exude grace. They adore their human companions and prefer a lap to curl up in and perfectly capture the curved lines of all sighthounds.","traits-appearance":"The Italian Greyhound looks like a perfect miniature replica of a [Greyhound](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/greyhound). Its tiny frame and slender legs are surprisingly sturdy.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Italian Greyhounds have a short and glossy coat that can come in almost all colors, but most often manifests as fawn, brindle, or blue-gray.","traits-physical":"As the tiny version of a Greyhound, the Italian Greyhound has a beautifully sleek, muscular body. A slender head and graceful neck make these dogs excellent coursing hounds.","temperament":"This breed loves their human partners and will be doting, loyal companions. The Italian Greyhound is a charming dog who requires a lot of attention and enjoys a family that will lavish them with love and affection. The Italian Greyhound is very alert and they love to play, but they are sensitive and only do well with positive training.","care-nutrition":"Italian Greyhounds require a high-quality dog food that is age-appropriate—whether it’s commercially manufactured or homemade (with a veterinarian’s supervision and approval). It’s important to monitor the amount of food you give your Italian Greyhound. Reduce the portions or restrict calories if your pup gains weight.\n\nYour veterinarian is always a good source to help provide you with appropriate nutrition and feeding guidelines.","care-grooming":"Surprisingly enough, an Italian Greyhound’s teeth are the most important element to maintain. Requiring brushing is required almost daily, and they also need a yearly cleaning by a veterinarian. Maintaining good dental hygiene is important for their overall long-term health.\n\nThey also need to have their nails trimmed on a regular basis, which is best done with an electric trimmer. Luckily, Italian Greyhound coats are short and require minimal care. A bath is only needed when a simple brushing won’t remove any dirt or debris.","care-exercise":"As with all hounds, Italian Greyhounds need regular exercise. This can range from playtime with another puppy companion to a walk on a leash. Going off-leash is never a good idea for this breed, as Italian Greyhounds will chase anything small and furry, and they can be incredibly difficult to get back, even when they’re trained.","care-training":"A sensitive but sometimes stubborn breed, the Italian Greyhound requires positive and patient training. If you’re using treats, they should be given straight away once the learned behavior is exhibited. Reward-focused learning will work far better than any harsh methods.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/italian-greyhound/\n\nhttp://italiangreyhound.org/index.php/illustrated-standard-2/\n\nhttp://italiangreyhound.org/index.php/about-italian-greyhounds","reviewed-by":"Cindy Elston, DVM, MPH","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":2.3,"weight-range-pet-max":6.4,"weight-range-show-min":2.7,"weight-range-show-max":5.0,"height-range-min":30.0,"height-range-max":38.0,"life-span-range-min":14.0,"life-span-range-max":15.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":94,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":57,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":39},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9e5f8c78-0ce3-5ff5-9ac8-98e7597f0847/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9e5f8c78-0ce3-5ff5-9ac8-98e7597f0847/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9e5f8c78-0ce3-5ff5-9ac8-98e7597f0847/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9e5f8c78-0ce3-5ff5-9ac8-98e7597f0847/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9e5f8c78-0ce3-5ff5-9ac8-98e7597f0847/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9e5f8c78-0ce3-5ff5-9ac8-98e7597f0847/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9e5f8c78-0ce3-5ff5-9ac8-98e7597f0847/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9e5f8c78-0ce3-5ff5-9ac8-98e7597f0847/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9e5f8c78-0ce3-5ff5-9ac8-98e7597f0847/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9e5f8c78-0ce3-5ff5-9ac8-98e7597f0847/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9e5f8c78-0ce3-5ff5-9ac8-98e7597f0847/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9e5f8c78-0ce3-5ff5-9ac8-98e7597f0847/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9e5f8c78-0ce3-5ff5-9ac8-98e7597f0847/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9e5f8c78-0ce3-5ff5-9ac8-98e7597f0847/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9e5f8c78-0ce3-5ff5-9ac8-98e7597f0847/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9e5f8c78-0ce3-5ff5-9ac8-98e7597f0847/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9e5f8c78-0ce3-5ff5-9ac8-98e7597f0847/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9e5f8c78-0ce3-5ff5-9ac8-98e7597f0847/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"9ecb012c-82a5-531a-ae4c-cec7102324aa","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/9ecb012c-82a5-531a-ae4c-cec7102324aa"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"dingo","name":"Dingo","plural-name":"Dingoes","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The Dingo is an ancient wild dog native to Australia. Fossil remains of Dingoes found in Western Australia date back more than 3,400 years. Though common throughout most of the mainland, these dogs aren't as numerous in the southern parts of Australia.\n\nDingoes are Australia's apex predators—preying on everything from the red kangaroo to birds, reptiles, frogs, and insects. When livestock farming expanded in Australia in the 19th century, Dingoes added sheep and cattle to their menu.\n\nIn 1880, construction began on a 3,488 foot-long \"Dingo fence\" to help control the Dingo population and protect livestock. Today, the greatest threat to the Dingo population comes from interbreeding with domestic dogs, which will dilute their gene pool over time.\n\nIf you're interested in adding a Dingo to your pack, be sure to research your local laws. Some places require permits, whereas others have imposed bans on ownership.","facts":"The Dingo is Australia's iconic wild dog. Though not commonly kept as pets, Dingoes can make loving, loyal companions if brought into the home at a very young age and consistently trained.","traits-appearance":"The Dingo is a medium-sized wild dog with a naturally lean build and bushy tail.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"A Dingo's coat can vary based on where they live. Alpine Dingoes dwelling at high elevations are mostly ginger-colored or black and tan. They grow thicker coats in the winter to stay warm. Desert Dingoes, on the other hand, have fine double coats that are reddish, golden, or sand-colored. Finally, tropical Dingoes found in the forests and wetlands have ginger and creamy-white single coats.","traits-physical":"Notable features of the Dingo include a broad, wedge-shaped head, large, pricked ears, long, tapered muzzle, and long teeth.","temperament":"Dingoes get attached to their environments and—if kept as pets—to their people at a young age. Once they've bonded, they don't like to be alone, and it's difficult to relocate or rehome them as adults.\n\nThese wild dogs rarely bark, but they do howl (and very melodically, at that). They have a curious nature and are generally not aggressive toward strangers. However, they typically don't accept people that are outside their \"pack.\"\n\nThroughout their first year of life, Dingoes need persistent [socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) to get comfortable with different people and situations.","care-nutrition":"Wild Dingoes are opportunistic eaters, preying on various mammals or snacking on scraps of food discarded at campsites.

When walking a Dingo, keep them on a leash with a secure harness at all times.","care-training":"Dingoes are intelligent dogs. And if you train early and often, they tend to respond well.

And he wanted a sturdy breed that would help him with his work.\n\nAs the area dog catcher, Dobermann had access to dogs of many different breeds—some of which do not exist today. As he began developing what would become the Doberman Pinscher, he sought to create a breed with the color, shape, and strength of the Rottweiler and Great Dane, the agility and determination of the German Pinscher, the speed of the Greyhound, the tenacity of various Terriers, and the sleek coat and figure of the Manchester Terrier. He also added Schnauzers, German Shepherds, German Shorthaired Pointers, and Weimaraners to the mix.\n\nThis new breed came to the United States in the early 20th century, and the Doberman Pinscher Club of America was founded shortly after. Today, the club has more than 2,000 members and 58 chapters located throughout the United States.","facts":"The Doberman Pinscher is a fearless, vigilant, intelligent breed that loves to please.

But they tend to be reserved with strangers and unfriendly toward strange dogs. [Socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) can help reduce these tendencies.\n\nThis breed is fiercely loyal to family—without being overly protective or aggressive. That being said, the Doberman is a confident dog that will defend its home and people if needed. Though commonly thought to be an intimidating breed, Doberman Pinschers are a stable, friendly, and loyal companion.","care-nutrition":"Doberman Pinschers need a high-quality diet that’s formulated for their age. Take care with how much food you give your Doberman, and reduce portions if your pup gains weight. Also, remember that giving too many treats can contribute to obesity.","care-grooming":"Routine grooming will keep your Doberman Pinscher looking their finest. To maintain their coat’s healthy shine, use a short-bristled brush or grooming mitt.  The Doberman Pinscher’s nails should be trimmed monthly, and teeth brushed regularly. Your veterinarian may also advise wiping out your dog’s ears every few days to keep them clean.","care-exercise":"Doberman Pinschers are energetic, strong, and have great stamina.

The breed descended from local shepherd dogs and was first recognized in Belgium during the late 19th century.\n\nSkilled herding dogs, Belgian Malinoises are the preferred breed for cattlemen and shepherds in their native land. In other countries, Belgian Malinoises are classified together with breeds like Laekenois, Tervuren, and Groenendael but have been registered as a separate breed in the United States since 1959.\n\nA strong work ethic has made the Belgian Malinois popular for jobs off the farm; the dogs are often found working in military and police K9 units. A bronze statue of a Belgian Malinois at the Airborne and Special Operations Museum in Fayetteville, North Carolina, honors the dogs that have served in the line of duty since September 11, 2001.","facts":"The Belgian Malinois is a confident, intelligent working dog that takes pride in a job well done.\n\nTheir strong protective instincts make Belgian Malinoises excellent guard dogs.","traits-appearance":"Belgian Malinoises are strong, agile, muscular dogs. Their bodies are similar in length and height and their topline, forelegs, and hind legs lend them a square appearance that adds to their well-balanced, elegant carriage.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Belgian Malinoises have dense undercoats and short, straight overcoats with a texture that is hard enough to be weather resistant. Their hair is shorter on the head, ears, and lower legs, while longer around the neck, forming a collarette; the hair on their tails and backs of their thighs is longer, too.\n\nTheir coloring ranges from fawn to mahogany with black tips on the hair that give their coats the appearance of an overlay; their masks and ears are also black, while the undersides of their bodies, tail, and breaches are lighter fawn. In show, white is permitted on the tips of the toes and in a small area on the breastbone, not to extend to the neck.","traits-physical":"These are working dogs with heavy bone structures, deep chests, short, strong loins, and muscular forequarters. Belgian Malinoises also have moderately pointed muzzles; triangular ears that are stiff and erect; and brown, medium-sized, almond-shaped eyes with an alert, attentive expression and an intelligent gaze.","temperament":"The right temperament is essential for this working breed. Belgian Malinoises are confident, protective, and reserved with strangers but not aggressive. With their owners, the breed is known for being affectionate, responsive to commands, and eager to please.\n\nBelgian Malinoises have strong predatory instincts that can lead them to chase cars, children, and small animals. They are best suited to homes with older (or no) children and with well socialized dogs of similar size.","care-nutrition":"Feed Belgian Malinoises a high-quality dog food that is appropriate for their life stage (puppy, adult, senior) and consider a diet formulated for active breeds. Like other breeds, Belgian Malinoises could become overweight if their food intake is not monitored. Portion out their food with a standard measuring cup and limit treats to no more than 10% of their daily calories to avoid overfeeding.","care-grooming":"Belgian Malinoises have short, waterproof coats that are a snap to maintain. Brush them at least once per week to remove dead hair and reduce shedding. During semi-annual “shedding season” when the breed blows its coat, daily brushing and regular baths can help. Trim their nails to prevent cracking, splitting and painful overgrowths, and clean their ears. Regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) that includes at-home teeth brushing and professional cleanings is also an essential part of their grooming routines.","care-exercise":"These smart, active dogs require a lot of exercise. Belgian Malinoises love all activities, including hiking, running, and swimming and are tough competition in dog sports like agility, tracking, herding, and obedience. As long as they are burning off energy and spending time with their owners, Belgian Malinoises are happy. Due to their strong prey drive, these dogs might not make the best companions at the dog park.\n\nLeft alone for too long (or without enough exercise) Belgian Malinoises can develop behavior problems. In addition to high-intensity physical activity, provide mental stimulation with hide and seek, puzzle toys, or other interactive games.","care-training":"Training is a must for Belgian Malinoises. These dogs are intelligent and eager to learn new things; some might see training as a job and be enthusiastic students. Obedience training can help Belgian Malinoises control their herding instincts and socialization can encourage the breed to be more accepting of strangers and reduce fear-based aggression. Learning basic commands and new tricks also provides important mental stimulation.\n\nBelgian Malinoises respond to consistent, firm training that prioritizes positive reinforcement and rewards-based training; the breed can be sensitive and does not appreciate harsh training methods.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/belgian-malinois/\n\nhttp://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/BelgianMalinois.pdf","reviewed-by":"Laura Inman,

Dachsbracke","plural-name":"Alpine Dachsbrackes","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"Originating from Austria, the Alpine Dachsbracke is a hound with some impressive royal lineage. As the story goes, Crown Prince Rudolf of Habsburg took hunting trips to the Middle East in the late 1800s. On these trips, he required his gamekeepers to bring a dog that appeared to be very similar to (if not actually) the Alpine Dachsbracke.\n\nThese dogs descended from an ancient hunting breed. Hunters used them as tracking dogs for wounded deer and as scent hounds for fox and hare. Their short stature and longer ears made them highly efficient at following a trail—even when the scent has gone cold. And as their name suggests, they also performed well at high altitude.\n\nAustria recognized the Alpine Dachsbracke in 1932, and the FCI accepted it as a Scenthound in 1991. Five years later, the United Kennel Club recognized the breed.","facts":"Alpine Dachsbrackes are active, loyal dogs with keen hunting instincts. Their fearlessness and intelligence make them great working dogs. But it's their friendly nature that wins people over when choosing their ideal furry friend.","traits-appearance":"The Alpine Dachsbracke is a medium-sized hunting dog with a sturdy build and strong muscles.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The breed has a close-fitting double coat made of a thick topcoat and dense undercoat. The ideal color is a dark \"deer\" red, with or without black hairs. It's also acceptable for Alpine Dachsbrackes to have a black coat with clearly defined red-brown markings on the head, chest, legs, feet, and underside of the tail.","traits-physical":"Alpine Dachsbrackes have a noticeable furrow in their foreheads, broad hanging ears, elongated bodies, and short, strong legs.","temperament":"Though bred for hunting, Alpine Dachsbrackes enjoy the companionship of people and other dogs. They're friendly, easygoing pups that get along well with kids.\n\nBecause of their strong prey drive, Alpine Dachsbrackes may chase cats or other small pets. They also love to follow a scent, so it's essential to have a fenced yard to prevent them from wandering off.","care-nutrition":"Alpine Dachsbrackes require a diet formulated for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). A food made specifically for medium-sized breeds should have the appropriate blend of nutrients.\n\nYou may need to adjust how much you feed, depending on your pup's daily activity level. A dog that hunts all day will require more calories than one that spends most of the day lounging around the house.","care-grooming":"Most of the time, weekly brushing is enough to keep the Alpine Dachsbracke's coat free of loose hair and dirt. However, these dogs do blow their coats a couple of times a year. You'll likely need to brush more frequently during these seasonal shedding periods to keep the hair from overtaking your home.\n\nBe sure to round out your pup's routine care with nail trims, ear cleanings, and a dental hygiene program that includes at-home teeth brushing and professional dental cleanings.","care-exercise":"Alpine Dachsbrackes are active dogs that need plenty of regular exercise. True to their hound dog heritage, they love hunting and tracking.

And when it comes to this breed's origins, the theories are just as varied. But the most popular is that the Turks developed the Spanish Water Dog for use as sheepdogs.\n\nMost experts believe wooly-coated water dogs that existed on the Iberian Peninsula in 1110 A.D. were the ancestors of the Spanish Water Dog. But it wasn't until the 1970s that Santiago Montesinos and Antonio Garcia Perez traveled around Spain collecting dogs to establish a breed standard.\n\nSpanish Water Dogs have held a variety of jobs over the years—fisherman's helper, farmer's gundog, sheepdog, retriever, and more. They continue to herd sheep and goats in southern Spain to this day. The Spanish Government also uses them as search and rescue dogs and for bomb and drug detection.\n\nThe Spanish Water Dog initially joined the American Kennel Club's sporting group but moved to the herding group in 2011 after a request from the Spanish Water Dog Club of America.","facts":"The Spanish Water Dog is a brave, intelligent, even-tempered, and athletic breed. These curly-coated dogs are skilled herders and retrievers. Another job Spanish Water Dogs excel at? Loyal family companion.","traits-appearance":"The Spanish Water Dog is a rustic-looking, sturdy, medium-sized, athletic dog with a distinctive curly coat.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Spanish Water Dog has a wooly curled coat that forms cords when it gets long. Solid-colored coats come in black, brown, or white. Bi-colored coats are white and black or white and brown.","traits-physical":"Spanish Water Dogs appear alert and attentive, with expressive brown eyes that range from hazel to dark chestnut. They have triangular, drooping ears with rounded tips. Some Spanish Water Dogs are born with a naturally bobbed tail.","temperament":"The Spanish Water Dog is a playful, upbeat, intelligent breed that's best-suited for experienced dog owners.\n\nSpanish Water Dogs can make great family pets. They love attention from people, but typically bond most strongly with one member of the family. Their strong protective instincts make them effective guard dogs.\n\nThough friendly with children, this breed shouldn't be left around them unattended. Spanish Water Dogs have powerful herding instincts and often can't help trying to \"herd\" kids, as well as other pets.\n\nAlso typical of herding dogs, Spanish Water Dogs can be workaholics. That means they thrive in environments with lots of activity and learning experiences. If they get bored, they may find something destructive to do just to stay busy.","care-nutrition":"Spanish Water Dogs need high-quality food that's appropriate for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). Avoid accidental overfeeding by measuring meals. And be sure to include calories from treats when calculating their daily intake. As a general guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of a dog's calories.","care-grooming":"The most important thing to know about a Spanish Water Dog's grooming needs is that their coat should never be brushed or combed.\n\nTo keep your dog clean, bathe them using a gentle shampoo, but never rub the coat vigorously during washing or drying. Instead, gently blot the coat with a towel or let it air-dry to prevent mats from forming. Spanish Water Dogs also need their hair clipped—ideally by a professional groomer—at least once a year.\n\nYour Spanish Water Dog's nails will wear down some through regular activity. But you should still inspect them routinely for splits or cracks and trim as needed. Overgrown nails can be painful and could eventually lead to issues walking or running.\n\nFinally, maintaining good [dental hygiene](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) is essential for the overall long-term health of all dogs, regardless of breed. In addition to scheduling professional dental cleanings, aim to establish an at-home routine that includes regular teeth brushing.","care-exercise":"Spanish Water Dogs require plenty of daily mental and physical activity. They're natural athletes that excel at dog sports—such as herding, agility, water work, flyball, and obedience training. Spanish Water Dogs are also great in the water. So, swimming or games of fetch in a lake or river are fun ways for them to burn off any pent-up energy.","care-training":"Spanish Water Dogs are very intelligent and eager to please. But you should use a gentle tone during training because this breed tends to shut down if training methods are too harsh. Reward-based training using favorite treats or toys is the secret to success.\n\nSpanish Water Dogs may be wary around people they don't know. [Socializing your dog early](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) helps prevent this and other undesirable behaviors.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/spanish-water-dog/\n\nhttp://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/SpanishWaterDog.pdf\n\nhttps://www.swdclub.org/breedinformation.html\n\nhttps://www.swdclub.org/groomingtheswd.html","reviewed-by":"Laura

And ‘Coonhound’ refers to a dog bred to hunt raccoon, though they also chased larger game.\n\nThe Treeing Walker Coonhound (or the Treeing Walker, as it’s sometimes known) came from a combination of other Foxhound breeds, creating a breed known then as the English Coonhound.\n\nTreeing Walkers broke away as a unique breed in 1945. It’s best known now for its hunting skills and its loud, ringing voice that alerted hunters to their prey.","facts":"Best known for its excellent wild raccoon hunting skills, the Treeing Walker Coonhound is a fast and active breed. Named for its ability to chase its prey up into trees, Treeing Walker Coonhounds are also smart and social, making it a good candidate for a family pet—as long as it’s well-exercised.","traits-appearance":"This medium-sized breed has a muscular build with floppy ears set moderately low and reaching nearly the tip of their nose. They have large brown eyes with a soft, pleading expression, and a short, glossy coat.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Treeing Walker Coonhound is usually tri-colored in white, black, and tan.

Their smooth, glossy fur is short but built for protection and repels dirt and mud. They also have powerful hind legs and well-muscled thighs, ready to propel them on to their next catch.","temperament":"The first thing on the mind of a Treeing Walker Coonhound is hunting, and they can take off at a moment’s notice to follow their prey. For this reason, they should be kept on a leash or in an enclosed area at all times.\n\nAlthough the Treeing Walker can have a stubborn, independent streak — which can sometimes make training tricky — they tend to be courteous and friendly with people.\n\nA hunter at heart, the Treeing Walker Coonhound is a vocal dog with multiple different barks, including a bugle-like sound used to track, and a short, choppy bark to announce trapped prey. Their excellent hunting capabilities earned them the nickname “the people’s choice.”","care-nutrition":"The Treeing Walker Coonhound is an active breed that does best with high-quality dog food that’s suited to their particular age, as well as any additional health concerns.\n\nAs with any dog, it’s important to monitor the amount of food and treats that you give your Treeing Walker Coonhound, especially since coonhounds that aren’t hunting every day may be prone to gaining weight as they age.

Its name comes from the word \"braque\"—a derivation of a French verb meaning \"to aim or point\"—and the Bourbonnais region of France where it originated during the Renaissance.\n\nThe Bourbonnais thrived for a short period after the creation of their first club in 1925. But after World War II, the number of club registrations decreased until it ceased to function. During this time, breeders based their trait selections on secondary characteristics—such as coat color and short tail—instead of the dog's innate hunting capabilities and general form. These choices ultimately made the breed less desirable for hunting, and the Bourbonnais nearly disappeared.\n\nIn the 1970s, a man named Michel Comte traveled to France in search of the last true Bourbonnais. Instead, he found only mixed breed dogs with the breed's characteristics. After several inbred litters, he created a breed that closely resembled the original Bourbonnais and registered it in 1973.\n\nThe Club du Braque du Bourbonnais re-formed in 1981, and the breed began to participate—and thrive—in field trials. Seven years later, the Bourbonnais came to the United States. Due to the breed's popularity, the U.S. now has the second-largest number of Bourbonnais registered, surpassed only by France.\n\nToday, the breed is famous for its pointing intensity, retrieving instinct, intelligence, and love for its family.","facts":"The Braque du Bourbonnais is a good-tempered and agreeable breed. They are calm, intelligent, and kind dogs, as well as keen hunters.","traits-appearance":"The Bourbonnais is a medium-sized dog with a compact and muscular build. The breed gives the impression of strength and power and exudes a certain elegance.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Braque du Bourbonnais' coat is fine, dense, and short. Many consider it elegant. The hair on the back is a little coarser, and sometimes longer. The hair on the head and ears is finer and shorter.\n\nThe Braque du Bourbonnais' coat can be liver or fawn in color, with smaller spots. The breed standard accepts larger spots on the body, so long as they're smaller than the palm of a hand.","traits-physical":"One of the Bourbonnais' most notable features is its characteristic pear-shaped head. The breed's rounded eyes are expressive, intelligent, and kind. The color of the eyes is hazel or dark amber—depending on the coat color.\n\nA Bourbonnais' ears are medium-length and can reach or extend beyond the throat. They hang naturally against the cheeks and are flat or slightly curled inwards. They may be born with a short tail or no tail at all.","temperament":"The Braque du Bourbonnais is an intelligent, good-natured, friendly dog that generally loves to be around people. On the flip side, the breed doesn't do well when left alone for long periods.\n\nBourbonnais are typically easy to train and adapt well to a variety of housing situations—provided they get enough mental and physical exercise.","care-nutrition":"Braque du Bourbonnais needs a high-quality diet that's appropriate for their current life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior).\n\nAll dogs have the potential to become overweight or obese. Maintain a healthy weight by monitoring their food and treats. Avoid accidental overfeeding by using a standard measuring cup to measure out their meals. Keep treats to no more than 10% of their calories each day.","care-grooming":"Weekly brushing and an occasional bath are typically all that it takes to keep the Braque du Bourbonnais' coat looking clean and healthy.\n\nThis breed has fast-growing nails, so be sure to trim them regularly to avoid overgrowth. In addition to splitting and cracking, overly long nails can cause pain or lead to trouble walking or running.\n\nAs all dogs do, Bourbonnais need regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care), including at-home teeth brushing and professional dental cleanings. Maintaining good dental hygiene is essential for their overall long-term health.","care-exercise":"Bourbonnais needs a moderate level of exercise. Aim to include running, long walks, or active play sessions in the backyard in their daily routines.\n\nBraque du Bourbonnais also enjoy dog sports, such as retrieving, tracking, hunting, field trials, agility, and competitive obedience. These activities take advantage of the breed's hunting instincts and provide mental stimulation.","care-training":"The Braque du Bourbonnais is eager to learn and respond well to reward-based training using treats or one of their favorite toys. They seek constant eye contact during training sessions and do best with a gentle handler.\n\n[Early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) will also help your Bourbonnais develop into a well-mannered adult dog.","care-health":null,"references":"http://www.elkrunkennels.com/breed-history.html\n\nhttp://www.fci.be/Nomenclature/Standards/179g07-en.pdf\n\nhttps://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/braque-du-bourbonnais/\n\nhttps://www.petguide.com/breeds/dog/braque-du-bourbonnais/","reviewed-by":"Laura Inman, DVM","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":15.9,"weight-range-pet-max":24.9,"weight-range-show-min":15.9,"weight-range-show-max":24.9,"height-range-min":48.0,"height-range-max":58.0,"life-span-range-min":10.0,"life-span-range-max":14.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":97,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":57,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":41},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a138d452-e7f2-58df-863e-078a4d9875d6/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a138d452-e7f2-58df-863e-078a4d9875d6/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a138d452-e7f2-58df-863e-078a4d9875d6/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a138d452-e7f2-58df-863e-078a4d9875d6/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a138d452-e7f2-58df-863e-078a4d9875d6/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a138d452-e7f2-58df-863e-078a4d9875d6/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a138d452-e7f2-58df-863e-078a4d9875d6/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a138d452-e7f2-58df-863e-078a4d9875d6/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a138d452-e7f2-58df-863e-078a4d9875d6/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a138d452-e7f2-58df-863e-078a4d9875d6/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a138d452-e7f2-58df-863e-078a4d9875d6/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a138d452-e7f2-58df-863e-078a4d9875d6/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a138d452-e7f2-58df-863e-078a4d9875d6/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a138d452-e7f2-58df-863e-078a4d9875d6/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a138d452-e7f2-58df-863e-078a4d9875d6/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a138d452-e7f2-58df-863e-078a4d9875d6/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a138d452-e7f2-58df-863e-078a4d9875d6/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a138d452-e7f2-58df-863e-078a4d9875d6/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"a148a41d-1fc9-528b-a986-3caa7f63751e","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a148a41d-1fc9-528b-a986-3caa7f63751e"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"persian","name":"Persian","plural-name":null,"published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"cat","history":"Persians are one of the oldest—not to mention most recognizable—cat breeds in the world. Like many ancient breeds, their exact origin is unclear. But hieroglyphic references to cats like Persians date back to 1684 B.C.\n\nHistorical records from the 17th century mention longhaired cats in Turkey and Persia. And experts believe that, in the 19th century, breeders crossed descendants of these longhaired Turkish cats with Italian longhaired cats to create the modern Persian.\n\nPersian cats rose to fame when Britain featured them in their first cat shows, and the breed captured the hearts of Queen Victoria and other royals. At the end of the 19th century, Persians arrived in the United States—where they became (and still are) wildly popular.","facts":"Persians are sweet, adaptable cats known for their flat faces and large, round eyes. This low-key, gentle breed gets along with everybody and makes a great addition to calm households.","traits-appearance":"Persians are medium-to-large cats with heavily boned, muscular bodies. They're famous for their overall round appearances, flat faces, and intelligent expressions.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Persian's coat is long, thick, and soft. These cats have a frill that covers their shoulders and chest—extending between their front legs—and long tufts of hair between their toes and inside their ears. Their tails are short with bushy fur.\n\nPersians come in various coat colors and patterns, including solid colors, colorpoint, shaded, tortoiseshell, and tabby.","traits-physical":"Persians are known for their short, snub noses, large, round heads, and small, round-tipped ears. Their big eyes come in various colors (depending on their coat color) and give them a sweet expression.\n\nThese cats have broad, muscular bodies, short, thick legs, and large, round paws. Their tails are short in proportion to their body and slightly rounded at the tip.\n\nDid we mention they are round?","temperament":"Persians are sweet cats that generally make easy-going housemates. Because of their quiet, gentle nature, this breed is best suited for calm indoor environments. Though they enjoy being petted by kids, they're not the kind of cat that likes rough-housing.\n\nThis breed is just as content to play with cat toys as lounge around on a comfy piece of furniture. Though Persians are happy when their humans return home after a day at work or school, they don't mind spending time in the house alone, either. They're also not overly demanding cats. But when they want to make their needs known, they're more likely to communicate with their big, expressive eyes than their soft, musical voices.\n\nYou'll rarely find a Persian perched high on a cabinet, as these cats prefer the safety of being close to the ground.","care-nutrition":"Persians require a high-quality diet formulated for their age and activity level. Consider foods that address their breed-specific nutritional needs. For example, Persian diets often contain nutrients that promote shiny coats or kibble shapes designed for the breed's short jaw.\n\nPersians aren't the most active cat breed. So, it's important to keep their calories in check to prevent obesity. Avoid overfeeding by carefully measuring your cat's food with a standard measuring cup. And remember, treats should contribute to no more than 10% of their daily calories.\n\nIn addition to meals, make sure your cat has access to clean water at all times. Some Persian cats prefer to drink out of water fountains, which keeps the plentiful fur on their chests drier.","care-grooming":"A Persian's grooming needs depend on their coat variety. Cats with silky coats require less maintenance than those with soft textures, which tend to stain and mat more easily. But no matter the coat type, all Persians need daily brushing to prevent tangles and remove loose hair—which, left unattended, can result in hairballs.\n\nPersians also benefit from occasional baths. But don't worry. Once they get used to it, they typically enjoy a good bath. In addition to cleaning your cat's coat, wipe their eyes daily to remove dust or other irritants that can lead to runny eyes.\n\nFinally, round out their grooming routine with regular nail trims, at-home teeth brushing, and professional dental cleanings.","care-exercise":null,"care-training":null,"care-health":"Persians are a brachycephalic breed. That means they have physical features—such as a flat face, short nose, and wide skull—that may cause health issues. Potential challenges include breathing difficulties, heat sensitivity, jaw deformities that lead to dental disease, trouble eating or drinking, and skin or eye issues.\n\nPersians may also be more prone to developing Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy.

can trace the Vizsla (also known as the Hungarian Pointer) to the earliest days of Hungarian history—to tribes that inhabited the Carpathian Basin in 1000 B.C.\n\nVizslas likely descended from the Yellow Turkish Hunting Dog and the now-extinct Transylvanian Hound. Over time, breeders also introduced European dogs to add hunting skills and create the current standard for the Vizsla. One of the oldest known hunting dogs, the Vizsla is actually the ancestor of some of today's newer breeds—such as the [Weimaraner](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/weimaraner) and [German Shorthair Pointer](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/german-shorthaired-pointer).\n\nThe creation of other breeds and chaos of two World Wars almost led to the Vizsla's disappearance. But the breed bounced back. And now Vizslas serve all over the world as seeing-eye dogs, sniffers for the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), and search and rescue dogs.\n\nVizslas came to the United States in 1950, and the breed received American Kennel Club recognition in 1960.","facts":"Both a pointer and a retriever, the Vizsla is an energetic, alert, and intelligent breed. It's easy to see why this sensitive, hard-working redhead has been a favorite hunting dog for centuries.","traits-appearance":"The Vizsla is a medium-sized, lightly built hunting dog with an attractive rust-colored coat.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Vizsla's coat is short, smooth, and dense. It comes in a variety of golden and red shades, ranging from a light, sandy yellow to a deep red. A small amount of white on the chest is possible. The breed's nose is always liver.","traits-physical":"The Vizsla is a lean, muscular dog with a square muzzle and a body that's slightly longer than it is tall. The thin, silky ears have rounded ends and hang close to the cheeks. The color of the breed's medium-sized eyes blends with the color of the coat.","temperament":"The Vizsla is an intelligent and energetic breed that loves to learn and please. Devoted and loyal to their families, these dogs are gentle with other animals and kids. Because they prefer to be outdoors, rural environments suit Vizslas best.\n\nVizslas form very tight bonds with their people and don't like to be left alone for long periods. Though they're typically exuberant around people they know, Vizslas may be shy around strangers.\n\nThese dogs have very strong hunting instincts and may chase or hunt wildlife. Vizslas also like to chew. And if not provided with appropriate chew toys, they may take matters into their own paws (and mouths).","care-nutrition":"Vizslas need high-quality food that's appropriate for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior) and activity level. Because Vizslas can have hearty appetites, keep an eye on your dog's food intake, and reduce meal portions if they become overweight. Also, remember to account for treats in your pup's overall calorie intake. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of a dog's calories.","care-grooming":"Vizslas' short coats don't need much in the way of grooming. This breed does shed, but brushing once a week with a rubber grooming brush is usually sufficient. Vizslas don't often need baths unless they roll in something dirty or smelly.\n\nThis breed's nails grow very fast. Trim them regularly to prevent them from becoming overgrown. Nails that get too long can cause discomfort or lead to problems walking.\n\nFinally, maintaining good [dental hygiene](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) is essential for any dog's long-term health. In addition to scheduling professional dental cleanings, establish an at-home care routine that includes teeth brushing.","care-exercise":"True to their sporting heritage, Vizslas need a lot of daily exercise. Long walks, hikes, and backyard games of fetch give them opportunities to burn off energy. Vizslas also love to swim and make good jogging buddies.\n\nOther fun options are dog sports—such as flyball, hunt and field trials, agility, tracking, and competitive obedience. These events provide not only physical exercise but also mental stimulation.","care-training":"The Vizsla is an intelligent, curious breed that's generally easy to train—which is fortunate because untrained Vizslas make difficult housemates. Consistent training, [early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization), and positive reinforcement techniques are the best ways to teach this sensitive breed to behave.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/lifestyle/7-things-you-didnt-know-about-the-vizsla/\n\nhttp://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/Vizsla.pdf\n\nhttps://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/vizsla/","reviewed-by":"Annette

Podengo Medio","plural-name":"Portuguese Podengos Medios","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"Thousands of years ago, Phoenicians brought Portuguese Podengos to the Iberian Peninsula from Asia Minor. The breed then became very common in northern Portugal and gained popularity as hunters and companions.\n\nPortuguese Podengos use their keen senses to hunt vermin and rabbits. This talent earned them passage on the ships of many early explorers—including Vasco da Gama and Magellan—where they protected the food stores and sailors from rodent-borne diseases.\n\nThe Portuguese Podengo Médio is slightly bigger than the [Portuguese Podengo Pequeño](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/portuguese-podengo-pequenos) and slightly smaller than the Portuguese Podengo Grande. The Fédération Cynologique Internationale recognized the breed in 1967.","facts":"The Portuguese Podengo Médio is active and playful among family. And though these pups can be reserved with strangers, they're generally good with other dogs and children.","traits-appearance":"The medium-sized Portuguese Podengo Médio has a slender square body that's well-proportioned and muscular.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Portuguese Podengos can have smooth or wire coats that range from a lighter yellow or fawn color to a darker yellow with black sabling. These coats can be solid-colored or have areas of white—usually on the face, chest, legs or feet, and tip of the tail.","traits-physical":"The Portuguese Podengo's distinctive characteristics are its large, upright, triangular ears and wedge-shaped head. These dogs also have almond-shaped, expressive eyes.","temperament":"Portuguese Podengos enjoy the company of other dogs and humans alike. So, they make excellent companions and natural pack dogs. That being said, the Podengo may view smaller animals as prey, and they tend to dig.\n\nFunny, playful dogs, Portuguese Podengos are usually good with children when [socialized at an early age](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization). They make good guard dogs, too, as they readily bark when strangers approach their home. But some Podengos have such a piercing bark that they may not make a suitable pet for those who live in close quarters, such as an apartment complex.","care-nutrition":"Portuguese Podengos require a high-quality, age-appropriate diet. Be sure to monitor how much your Podengo Médio eats, and reduce portions if your pup gains excess weight. Also, remember that giving too many treats in addition to regular meals can contribute to obesity.","care-grooming":"Wire-haired Podengos shed in sections. So, you should brush regularly to remove dead hair and keep your dog's coat looking its best. Smooth-coated dogs don't need as much grooming—an occasional sweep with a brush will do.\n\nPortuguese Podengos need periodic baths and monthly nail trims. It's also a good habit to inspect your dog's ears frequently for wax buildup and debris.\n\nAll dogs need dental care, which should include daily teeth brushing and occasional professional cleanings. Maintaining good [dental hygiene](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) is essential for your pup's overall health.","care-exercise":"This hardy, lively breed requires a lot of exercise and room to run. But you should make sure they get their exercise in a secure area with a tall fence. (As skilled hunting dogs, Podengos can jump incredibly high.)\n\nPortuguese Podengos are independent thinkers and excel at many dog sports—including agility, obedience, and rally.","care-training":"A bright, people-pleasing breed, the Portuguese Podengo is a fast learner motivated by both fun and food. That said, these dogs have an independent nature and are not always easy to train. A firm, positive approach should help—along with obedience classes starting as early as possible.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_New_Complete_Dog_Book/w4Z1CAAAQBAJ\n\nhttps://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/portuguese-podengo/","reviewed-by":"Cindy

Terrier","plural-name":"Cairn Terriers","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The Cairn Terrier originated in the 16th century on the Isle of Skye in Scotland. At that time, the breed was known as the Short-Haired Skye Terrier.\n\nThese dogs were bred to hunt smaller animals, such as foxes, weasels, and rodents. In 1912, the breed's name changed to Cairn Terrier—a reference to the rock formations where the dogs would often hunt vermin. And the American Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1913.\n\nThe best-known Cairn Terrier in the United States to date is Toto, a character from the 1939 classic film The Wizard of Oz.","facts":"The Cairn Terrier is a happy, active, and courageous breed. Craving human interaction, Cairn Terriers have great personalities and are well-suited for children. These hardy dogs like having places to explore and dig.","traits-appearance":"Cute and compact, the Cairn Terrier is a bright-eyed little pup.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Cairn Terrier's medium-length coat may be any color besides white, including black, cream, gray, red, silver, wheaten, or brindle-striped shades. Black markings, points, or a black mask are also common (and desirable).","traits-physical":"Small and stocky in appearance, the short-legged Cairn Terrier has a rugged, shaggy look. This breed holds its broad, wide head and sharply pointed ears up high.","temperament":"Active, alert, intelligent, and inquisitive dogs, Cairn Terriers thrive with attention but struggle when left alone too much. In fact, they may become destructive when lonely and bored.\n\nThe Cairn Terrier is a small, working breed that likes to please, keep busy, and be challenged. As a result, it can be hard to distract these dogs from an activity they enjoy.","care-nutrition":"Cairn Terriers need a high-quality dog food that is age-appropriate. As you should with any dog, be sure to monitor the amount of food your Cairn Terrier consumes and reduce the portions if your pup gains weight. Also, remember that giving too many treats in addition to regular meals can contribute to obesity.","care-grooming":"In terms of grooming needs, Cairn Terriers are generally low-maintenance. Weekly brushing and combing—as well as occasional hand-stripping to retain the coat's texture—will keep your pup looking their finest.","care-exercise":"A modest amount of daily movement should satisfy the exercise needs of your Cairn Terrier. These dogs prefer activities that involve their owners—such as long walks, short runs, or play sessions. Cairn Terriers also seem to enjoy dog sports such as agility, tracking, flyball, and obedience.","care-training":"Though they can be stubborn or strong-willed, Cairn Terriers respond to gentle, reward-based training. And thanks to their high intelligence, they are quick to learn.\n\nDue to the breed's history of hunting, Cairn Terriers may bark, scratch at the ground or dig, and chase wildlife. But they're friendly with other dogs and pets when [properly socialized](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization).\n\nCairn Terriers get along well with kids. But like dogs of any breed, they should not be in the company of children without supervision.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/cairn-terrier/\n\nhttps://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/dog-breeds/cairn-terrier","reviewed-by":"Cindy Elston, DVM,

the 18th century, coal miners in northern England needed a dog that they could use for both hunting and entertainment. They couldn’t afford to feed or house large Greyhounds, so the miners bred a smaller version of this racing dog. Although it’s not known which specific breeds were used to create the Whippet, the resulting dog was the fastest of its size, able to reach speeds of 35 miles per hour.\n\nThe name Whippet comes from the term “whappet,” which means “small dog that yelps.” By the turn of the 20th century, textile workers from Lancashire began moving to New England, bringing with them their dogs, the Whippet. Popularity for the breed took off in America, where racing the breed became an instant hit. The first Whippet was registered with the AKC in 1888.","facts":"Intelligent, quiet and friendly, Whippets make great companions as long as they get plenty of exercise. They are fairly low-maintenance, but require attention around cats and wildlife, since they have a tendency to chase after them.","traits-appearance":"The Whippet is a natural-born athlete. A picture of agile speed with the inverted S-curve of the sighthound, they look much like smaller versions of their close relatives, the Greyhound. They are a medium-sized dog with large, expressive eyes and a smoothly arched back.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Whippets come in almost all color types and don’t have a specific color assigned to their breed. Their base color spans fawn, red, orange, tan, cream, black, and blue-gray. Markings that can also be present include brindle with black stripes, brindle with bluish stripes, black mask, blue mask, watermarking, sabling, and varying amounts of white from entirely white to just the tips of toes and tail.\n\nYou can even find Whippets with black or blue saddle blanket over a base of fawn or brindle (with or without white), although this is rare.","traits-physical":"Carrying the typical inverted “S” of sighthounds, these dogs have a sleek and powerful look. They have a small, pointed head atop their long graceful neck. This leads to a deep chest tapering down to a slim body, supported by thin but strong legs.","temperament":"Whippets are gentle, affectionate companions. They love spending time with their human counterparts and are wonderful with children. They have a tendency to chase smaller animals, particularly if those animals are running away from them. They do well with strangers and other dogs, and they rarely bark. With the right amount of exercise they are excellent, sturdy companions.","care-nutrition":"Whippets require a high-quality dog food that is age-appropriate—whether it’s commercially manufactured or homemade (with a veterinarian’s supervision and approval). It’s important to monitor the amount of food you give your Whippet. Reduce the portions or restrict calories if your pup gains weight, as whippets can easily become overweight.","care-grooming":"Whippets shed less than other breeds, and their short, light coat only requires a brush once a week and an occasional bath as needed. Whippets are a very low-maintenance grooming dog.\n\nAll dogs require regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care), including at-home teeth brushing and professional dental cleanings, and the Whippet is no exception. Maintaining good dental hygiene is important for their overall long-term health.","care-exercise":"Whippets need to be exercised daily, and are natural born sprinters that love to retrieve. A mixture of intense fetch sessions and regular walks will keep them happy. They are also social and enjoy play sessions with another dog. They make great competitors in lure coursing, as well. It is important to always keep them on a lead, as they have a tendency to chase.","care-training":"Whippets are smart and eager to please, which makes training them relatively easy. Using positive training methods, like treats or exercise as rewards is important, as they are a very sensitive breed.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/whippet/\n\nhttps://www.americanwhippetclub.net/\n\nhttps://www.royalcanin.com/us/dogs/breeds/breed-library/whippet\n\nhttps://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/dog-breeds/whippet\n\nhttp://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/Whippet.pdf","reviewed-by":"Cindy

Terrier","plural-name":"Scottish Terriers","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"Scottish Terriers date back to 1500-era Scotland. Originally developed to hunt badgers in the Scottish Highlands, Scotties had strong tails so their owners could pull them out of the holes they had dug.\n\nThe Scottish Terrier received official recognition in 1859 in Birmingham, England, and it reached its modern standard in 1879. John Naylor brought the Scottish Terrier to the United States in 1883. And the breed received American Kennel Club recognition in 1885.\n\nAffectionately known as \"Scotties,\" Scottish Terriers have been popular in the U.S. for decades—even among presidents, such as Franklin D. Roosevelt and George W. Bush.","facts":"Scottish Terriers are intelligent, alert, and active dogs. They're also incredibly loyal and affectionate to their family. This breed's high-spirited personality—along with an almost human-like charm—makes it an excellent companion.","traits-appearance":"A sturdy breed with a regal profile, the short-legged Scottish Terrier is widely considered a big dog in a small dog's body.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Scottish Terrier may be black, wheaten, or brindle of any color—as long as it always has black stripes. The breed may also have brown, red, or silver as the lighter shade. A small white chest blaze is possible, as are a few white or gray hairs peppering the coat.","traits-physical":"The Scottish Terrier's head is characteristically long with perky, pointed ears that stand upright. It also has a bushy beard and eyebrows.","temperament":"Because of their hunting background, Scotties may bark, dig in the dirt, and chase wildlife. They can be tenacious or difficult to disengage from an activity, thanks to their stubborn streak.\n\nScottish Terriers are very friendly toward respectful, careful children. And they're loving and very protective over their family and territory. This trait makes them reserved—if not suspicious—of strangers. Scotties often don't get along well with other dogs.","care-nutrition":"Scotties need a high-quality dog food that is age-appropriate. As you should with any dog, be sure to monitor how much your Boston Terrier consumes, and reduce portions if your pup gains excess weight. Also, remember that giving too many treats in addition to regular meals can contribute to obesity.","care-grooming":"An outstanding feature of the Scottie is its double coat, which requires regular grooming. Baths are only occasionally needed—unless your dog gets particularly dirty. Regular nail trimming and [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) should also be a part of your Scottish Terrier's grooming routine.","care-exercise":"To be happy, Scotties require lots of physical exercise. They are very playful, like to bark and dig, and appreciate anything that keeps them busy and active—whether it's a brisk walk, chasing a ball, or playing games. Because of their high energy levels, Scottish Terriers excel at dog sports, such as earthdog trials, agility, and tracking.","care-training":"A firm but gentle approach to training is best for Scotties, as they can be sensitive pups. You should start both [socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) and training at an early age. To train your Scottie, begin with engaging, 15-minute sessions. This breed responds well to verbal praise and tends to get bored easily. Using a variety of teaching approaches is the recipe for success.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Scottish_Terrier/19kJBgAAQBAJ\n\nhttps://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/scottish-terrier/","reviewed-by":"Cindy Elston, DVM, MPH","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":7.3,"weight-range-pet-max":13.6,"weight-range-show-min":8.2,"weight-range-show-max":10.4,"height-range-min":25.0,"height-range-max":28.0,"life-span-range-min":10.0,"life-span-range-max":12.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":88,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":54,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":40},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a73266e3-28e4-5ece-ab51-5278d1743a95/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a73266e3-28e4-5ece-ab51-5278d1743a95/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a73266e3-28e4-5ece-ab51-5278d1743a95/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a73266e3-28e4-5ece-ab51-5278d1743a95/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a73266e3-28e4-5ece-ab51-5278d1743a95/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a73266e3-28e4-5ece-ab51-5278d1743a95/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a73266e3-28e4-5ece-ab51-5278d1743a95/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a73266e3-28e4-5ece-ab51-5278d1743a95/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a73266e3-28e4-5ece-ab51-5278d1743a95/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a73266e3-28e4-5ece-ab51-5278d1743a95/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a73266e3-28e4-5ece-ab51-5278d1743a95/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a73266e3-28e4-5ece-ab51-5278d1743a95/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a73266e3-28e4-5ece-ab51-5278d1743a95/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a73266e3-28e4-5ece-ab51-5278d1743a95/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a73266e3-28e4-5ece-ab51-5278d1743a95/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a73266e3-28e4-5ece-ab51-5278d1743a95/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a73266e3-28e4-5ece-ab51-5278d1743a95/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a73266e3-28e4-5ece-ab51-5278d1743a95/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"a74b86ca-3f07-5143-9517-efdba17f9ad0","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a74b86ca-3f07-5143-9517-efdba17f9ad0"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"bulldog-standard","name":"Bulldog","plural-name":"Bulldogs","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The Bulldog of today may look a bit like that of days gone by. But their personalities are nothing alike. Bulldogs were originally developed to be fierce bullfighters, with high pain tolerance and unparalleled aggression. But modern Bulldogs make for much friendlier pups.\n\nThe ancestors of Bulldogs—Bullenbeissers, Asian dogs resembling Mastiffs—served as military dogs for the Romans, Teutons, and Celts. And when the Bullenbeissers came to England, breeders worked to reduce the dog's overall size while increasing its head size. The resulting dog was very effective at bull baiting (i.e., pitting a bull against another animal), earning the name \"English Bulldog.\"\n\nExperts believe Bulldogs were first brought to the United States in 1735. Just 100 years later, bull-baiting was outlawed, and breeders started to eliminate the dog's aggressive tendencies. As a result, today's Bulldogs are much calmer and better suited to family life than the Bulldogs of the past.","facts":"Bulldogs are gentle, loving, and affectionate with their family. This docile, dignified, loyal breed adapts well, whether they live in an urban or rural setting.","traits-appearance":"Bulldogs have characteristically wide heads and shoulders, black, wide-set eyes, and a short muzzle.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Bulldog's short, smooth, and glossy coat comes in a variety of colors, including fallow, fawn, brindle, white, and red.","traits-physical":"The Bulldog has a recognizable look: loose skin on the head, a wrinkled brow, pushed-in nose, little ears, an underbite with an upturned lower jaw, and droopy skin flanking each side. They also have a unique rolling gait.","temperament":"Breeders have worked to reduce aggression in Bulldogs. Now, most dogs of this breed have an easygoing, patient disposition.\n\nThey're generally docile, sweet, and friendly. As such, Bulldogs make great family pets. They enjoy lots of attention, and they're eager to please (and curl up in a lap). Bulldogs typically befriend other pets but may be suspicious of unfamiliar dogs.","care-nutrition":"For healthy development, Bulldogs should be fed a high-quality pet food that is age-appropriate.\n\nBulldogs tend to stay at a good weight. But it's still wise to monitor food intake. Reduce portions or restrict calories if your pup gains weight. Also, remember that giving too many treats can contribute to obesity.","care-grooming":"Brushing your Bulldog from nose to tail with a soft brush for 10 minutes twice weekly will keep their coat looking good. During heavier shedding, you may want to use a rubber curry brush before the soft brush.\n\nBecause Bulldogs have heavily wrinkled faces, they need to be routinely checked to ensure their skin is clean and dry. Food or moisture can get caught in the wrinkles and cause irritation or infection. The ears and the area under the tail should be kept clean as well, and you should trim your Bulldog's nails every two weeks or so.","care-exercise":"Bulldogs need regular, moderate exercise. (A walk should do.) But you should limit strenuous exercise in the summer months. The Bulldog's short-nosed (a.k.a., brachycephalic) face can make breathing difficult if it's too hot and humid.\n\nBulldogs like to wade in shallow water. But they should never be allowed in water that's more than elbow deep unless carefully monitored.","care-training":"To help get your Bulldog off to a good start and curb unwelcome behaviors—such as chewing—begin [socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) and training classes early. As your pup grows, firm but gentle training will help you overcome the breed's stubborn tendencies. Reward-based training with small treats is also key.\n\nBulldogs are less energetic than other breeds, but they still need exercise to avoid becoming obese. Once engaged in an activity, a Bulldog can be rather tenacious and eager to continue playing.\n\nTug-o-war is a game that Bulldogs love. But remember that [puppy training](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-obedience-training) should include teaching your dog to release what's in their mouth on command. Relatedly, Bulldogs can be protective of their food. Nip this tendency in the bud by teaching your pup to be comfortable with people taking food from their bowl while they are eating.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/bulldog/","reviewed-by":"Cindy Elston, DVM,

Français Pyrenean","plural-name":"Braques Francaises Pyrenean","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The Braque Français is a type of French pointer that has existed since the 15th century. Over time, people brought or imported these hunting dogs to other countries and crossed them with other breeds. And by the end of the 19th century, there were two distinct types: the Gascony and the Pyrenean. Originating from southwest France and the Central Pyrenees, the Pyrenean type is the smaller and faster of the two.\n\nBraque Français Pyreneans are the most popular French pointer in their native country. Though not often found outside France, they have a small but loyal fan base in North American. The United Kennel Club recognized the breed in 2016. And that same year, the American Kennel Club recorded it in their Foundation Stock Service.","facts":"Braque Français Pyreneans are hunting dogs at heart. They make energetic and versatile companions in the field and affectionate, well-mannered pets at home.","traits-appearance":"The Braque Français Pyrenean is a medium-sized dog with a muscular build and rustic appearance.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"This breed's fine, short coat comes in either solid chestnut brown or chestnut mixed with white. Some dogs have ticking, roaning, or tan markings.","traits-physical":"The Braque Français Pyrenean has deep-set, chestnut brown or dark yellow eyes, a broad, brown nose, and medium-length ears. These dogs also have deep, broad chests, straight, strong backs, and muscular legs.","temperament":"Gentle, friendly, submissive dogs, Braque Français Pyreneans are eager to please their people. They make playful, loyal family pets and good watchdogs.\n\nMore than anything, these pups are versatile hunting companions. They have solid retrieving and flushing skills, love water, and have a strong prey drive. So, it's best to keep them on-leash when in an unenclosed area to prevent them from chasing after critters.","care-nutrition":"Braque Français Pyreneans thrive on a high-quality diet formulated for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). Obesity is a risk for all dogs and can contribute to other health issues. To help your dog maintain a healthy weight, keep an eye on their food intake and measure their portions to avoid overfeeding. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of your pup's daily calories.\n\nBecause of their deep chests, these dogs are at a greater risk of bloat (also known as twisted stomach). To help prevent bloat, break your dog's food up into several meals a day, and use a food bowl designed to slow their eating. Also, avoid feeding immediately before or after any vigorous activity. These are just a few ways you can help prevent this life-threatening condition. Consult your veterinarian about other methods, including surgical options.","care-grooming":"The Braque Français Pyrenean's short coat is relatively easy to maintain. Weekly brushing to remove loose fur and the occasional bath are usually all it takes to keep these dogs looking their best. But they do need their nails trimmed regularly and ears cleaned if you notice any wax build-up or debris.\n\nGood [dental hygiene](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) is also essential for any dog's overall long-term health. In addition to professional dental cleanings, establish an at-home dental care routine that includes regular teeth brushing.","care-exercise":"When hunting, Braque Français Pyreneans will get all the exercise they need. But on other days, long walks, backyard play sessions, swimming, and chasing balls will keep your pup happy and fit. You can also sign them up for dog sports—such as agility, rally, and competitive obedience.","care-training":"When it comes to training, the Braque Français Pyrenean prefers a gentle touch. These sensitive pups respond best to positive reinforcement using treats, favorite toys, and plenty of praise. In addition to obedience and field training, [early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) will help your pup develop into a well-mannered adult dog.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.ukcdogs.com/braque-francais-de-petite-taille#\n\nhttps://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/braque-francais-pyrenean/\n\nhttps://www.gundogmag.com/editorial/breed-profile-the-braque-francais/176194","reviewed-by":"Annette Louviere, DVM","date-reviewed":"2021-06-16T16:07:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":17.0,"weight-range-pet-max":25.0,"weight-range-show-min":17.0,"weight-range-show-max":25.0,"height-range-min":47.0,"height-range-max":58.0,"life-span-range-min":12.0,"life-span-range-max":14.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":null,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":null,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":null},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a82f8d3e-9bb8-5169-a99c-df787bbdba47/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a82f8d3e-9bb8-5169-a99c-df787bbdba47/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a82f8d3e-9bb8-5169-a99c-df787bbdba47/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a82f8d3e-9bb8-5169-a99c-df787bbdba47/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a82f8d3e-9bb8-5169-a99c-df787bbdba47/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a82f8d3e-9bb8-5169-a99c-df787bbdba47/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a82f8d3e-9bb8-5169-a99c-df787bbdba47/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a82f8d3e-9bb8-5169-a99c-df787bbdba47/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a82f8d3e-9bb8-5169-a99c-df787bbdba47/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a82f8d3e-9bb8-5169-a99c-df787bbdba47/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a82f8d3e-9bb8-5169-a99c-df787bbdba47/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a82f8d3e-9bb8-5169-a99c-df787bbdba47/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a82f8d3e-9bb8-5169-a99c-df787bbdba47/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a82f8d3e-9bb8-5169-a99c-df787bbdba47/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a82f8d3e-9bb8-5169-a99c-df787bbdba47/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a82f8d3e-9bb8-5169-a99c-df787bbdba47/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a82f8d3e-9bb8-5169-a99c-df787bbdba47/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a82f8d3e-9bb8-5169-a99c-df787bbdba47/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"a854ad56-1f40-584f-bc24-941c3238062b","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a854ad56-1f40-584f-bc24-941c3238062b"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"blue-tick-coonhound","name":"Bluetick Coonhound","plural-name":"Bluetick Coonhounds","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"Bluetick Coonhounds are an American scenthound lineage, although Bluetick bloodlines in general are believed to extend back to French staghounds that were given to George Washington as a gift from Marquis de Lafayette, the French aristocrat and military officer who fought in the American Revolutionary War. These original large dogs were eventually mixed with English Foxhounds and some other hound breeds to create a dog with stamina and endurance, as well as the ability to track with a “cold nose,” meaning they could follow scents that were days old.\n\nFrom the start, the Bluetick tracked everything from raccoon to wild boar to bear, tirelessly hunting down prey and alerting hunters to their finds with their bawling bark. Today Blueticks are a fixture in Southern culture—they’ve even been the University of Tennessee’s mascot since 1953.","facts":"A scenthound with a noble history, the Bluetick Coonhound is loyal and loving, and does well as a family pet, especially around older children. They can be reserved and wary of strangers, and are very vocal, but with the proper training and socialization they are excellent companions.","traits-appearance":"Blueticks are compact scenthounds named after their “ticked” black-and-blue coat pattern. These muscular dogs have droopy ears and clear, alert eyes.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Bluetick Coonhound gets its name from their distinct dark blue—or “ticked”—coat pattern, and their fur is normally short and glossy.","traits-physical":"The glossy coat of a Bluetick Coonhound is typically dark blue-gray and spotted—or mottled—by various shaped black spots on their back, ears and sides (otherwise referred to as “ticking”). You’ll usually find more blue than black on a Bluetick, with mottling throughout the entire body.","temperament":"These scenthounds are bred to hunt, but when they aren’t in pursuit of quarry, they make loving, loyal, and affectionate dogs—although they can often also be wary of strangers. They are active and smart, but since they have a strong hunting instinct, they should be monitored around cats and other small pets. Proper and consistent training can help mitigate some of their less-desirable traits.\n\nThe Bluetick is an active dog that requires plenty of mental and physical stimulation to prevent boredom, which can sometimes lead to destructive behavior. Because of their strong hunting instinct, they don’t always socialize well with other non-dog pets, and they should be monitored around cats and other small animals. They also tend to be very vocal. Most undesirable traits of the Bluetick can be subdued with the proper training and socialization, especially when started at a young age.\n\nWith the proper training, the Bluetick makes an excellent family dog, especially for families with older children. They are intelligent and loyal, although they can be wary around strangers. It’s also important to keep Blueticks leashed in all unconfined areas, since their instinct to hunt is strong and they are known to run off after a scent at every opportunity.","care-nutrition":"Bluetick Coonhounds require a high-quality dog food that is age-appropriate—whether it’s commercially manufactured or homemade (with a veterinarian’s supervision and approval). It’s important to monitor the amount of food you give your Bluetick Coonhound. Reduce the portions or restrict calories if your pup gains weight.\n\nYour veterinarian is always a good source to help provide you with appropriate nutrition and feeding guidelines.","care-grooming":"The Bluetick Coonhound’s coat sheds moderately, but a once-weekly grooming session with a grooming mitt should help keep it glossy while removing any stray hairs. This active dog might also require the occasional bath, especially after one of its outdoor adventures tearing through the underbrush. .\n\nAll dogs require regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care), including at-home teeth brushing and professional dental cleanings, and the Bluetick Coonhound is no exception. Maintaining good dental hygiene is important for overall long-term health.","care-exercise":"Although the Bluetick Coonhound has been known to enjoy a nap near its people, that’s generally only after spending a good amount of time running and playing. This is an active dog that was bred to hunt, and it requires plenty of daily exercise to stay healthy and happy. Luckily, the breed’s interests are varied. A Bluetick Coonhound will enjoy social play with its owner (which is best done in a secure yard, since these dogs can take off at a moment’s notice when they get a whiff of something worth hunting) or long, leashed walks.\n\nThe Bluetick Coonhound also does well with dog activities like hunting and field trials, agility and tracking.","care-training":"The Bluetick Coonhound does have a stubborn, independent streak, but they are also loyal and loving. When the proper training and socialization is introduced at an early age, some of the less desirable traits of this breed can be reduced.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/bluetick-coonhound/\n\nhttp://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/BluetickCoonhound.pdf","reviewed-by":"Laura Inman,

Terrier","plural-name":"Bedlington Terriers","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The Bedlington Terrier has a unique history—it’s the oldest unbroken pedigree dating back to 1782. Though records from the 1700s are spotty, the Bedlington breed likely originated from a mixture of Otterhounds, Whippets, Poodles, and Bull Terriers. The dogs rose from hunting in coal mines and started becoming more common in the manor houses of the British elite.The first dog identified as a Bedlington Terrier, Piper, was bred in 1825. The Bedlington Terrier has roots in hunting for multiple types of prey—including rabbits, rats, fox, and even otter, thanks to their swimming skills.\n\nThese days, the Bedlington Terriers are still excellent hunters, but because of their charm and loving nature, they also make great house pets.","facts":"Bedlington Terriers are fantastic family pets; they love kids and are ready, willing, and able to play with them, but they also love to relax and curl up with you at the end of a long day.\n\nThey are a highly social breed, and their intelligent and extroverted personality makes them just another member of the family.","traits-appearance":"Part of the Bedlington Terrier’s irresistible charm lies in its look; according to some, a Bedlington Terrier looks similar to a sheep. The breed has a crisp, delightfully curly coat, which along with their tasseled ears and fleecy head, are endearing traits distinct to this breed.They are graceful and well balanced, with a coat that can come in multiple colors.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Bedlington Terrier has a distinct coat that’s both hard and soft, crisp but not wiry, and curly, particularly near the head and face. They can be blue, sandy, liver, blue and tan, sandy and tan, or liver and tan.","traits-physical":"You’ll know a Bedlington Terrier from their sheep-like appearance. Their crisp and curly coat can come in multiple colors, and their head is covered with a striking topknot that tends to be slightly lighter in color than the rest of the body.","temperament":"Playful and exuberant, friendly, intelligent, and entertaining, the Bedlington Terrier makes a terrific family pet.\n\nBedlington Terriers are eager to please—so they tend to be pretty easy to train—and enjoy spending time with their people.","care-nutrition":"The Bedlington Terrier is an active breed that does best with high-quality dog food that’s suited to their particular age, as well as any additional health concerns.\n\nAs with any dog, it’s important to monitor the amount of food and treats that you give your Bedlington Terrier, especially since some dogs may be prone to gaining weight as they age. Your veterinarian is always a good source to help provide you with appropriate nutrition and feeding guidelines.","care-grooming":"The quintessential curly coat on the Bedlington Terrier rarely sheds, but it does grow quickly and will need to be cut or clipped every two months or so. Besides a haircut, this breed needs a brush once or twice a week to keep their coat healthy.\n\nAll dogs require regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care), cincluding at-home teeth brushing and professional dental cleanings, and the Bedlington Terrier is no exception. Maintaining good dental hygiene is important for their overall long-term health.","care-exercise":"True to their terrier roots, the Bedlington Terrier is an energetic breed that requires a lot of exercise to stay happy and healthy. The breed loves to be with its people, so it enjoys walks, runs, or a game of fetch in a (fenced in) yard. Because of their hunting background and ease of training, they make great candidates for dog sports like agility and tracking.","care-training":"A Bedlington can be, like most terriers, stubborn and independent. But they are also smart and eager to please, so they respond well to regular, positive training.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.bedlingtonamerica.com/breed-information/meet-the-bedlington/\n\nhttps://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/bedlington-terrier/\n\nhttp://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/BedlingtonTerrier.pdf","reviewed-by":"Annette

Sphynx originated in 1966 when a black and white cat in Ontario, Canada, gave birth to a hairless kitten. When that cat (aptly named Prune) was old enough, his owner bred him with other cats to produce more hairless kittens.\n\nHairlessness is a recessive gene. So, some of the kittens in the resulting litters had hair, while others did not. Because they resembled the ancient Egyptian Sphinx sculptures, people began referring to them as such.\n\nA decade later, more hairless cats appeared in Toronto and Minnesota. These kittens were crossed with another mostly hairless breed, the Devon Rex. And the offspring of these matings formed the foundation of the modern Sphynx breed.\n\nOver the years, breeders in Europe and North America have bred the Sphynx to coated cats and back to hairless ones to strengthen their overall genetic health.","facts":"There's no doubt that the Sphynx's hairless appearance is a conversation starter. But as one of the world's most intelligent, social, and affectionate cat breeds, it's got more going for it than its attention-grabbing looks.","traits-appearance":"Sphynx are medium-sized cats with a hairless appearance. They have wrinkled skin that's warm and soft in texture—similar to suede.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Despite being known as hairless cats, Sphynx aren't completely bald. The degree of hairlessness can vary, but some cats have a fine layer of down on their bodies. They also often have light hair on their nose, ears, cheekbones, and tip of their tail.\n\nContrary to popular belief, Sphynx are not hypoallergenic. Like any other cat, this breed secretes a protein in their saliva and skin known to cause cat allergies.\n\nSphynx come in various colors and patterns, including solid, particolor, tabby, and tortoiseshell. These colors and patterns show up in the pigment of their skin or on their few visible hairs.","traits-physical":"Sphynx have wedge-shaped heads and prominent cheekbones. Their massive ears are broad at the base and slightly rounded at the tip. Large, lemon-shaped eyes give them a sweet expression. They have broad chests, muscular bodies, and a full, round abdomen that has earned them comparisons to Buddha. Their tails are slender, long, and whip-like.","temperament":"The Sphynx loves to be the center of attention—which is good because they turn heads wherever they go. These social kitties want to be with their humans all the time. \"Independent\" certainly doesn't describe the average Sphynx.\n\nThese cats get along with just about everyone, including other pets and kids. They love to curl up in a lap and even sleep on a bed under the covers. Sphynx will also happily greet visitors. Their outgoing personalities and cuddly nature make them ideal therapy cats.\n\nBut if you're looking for a quiet pet, the Sphynx is not for you. These cats are purring machines and avid conversationalists. They're also curious, alert, and active. They love to play and keep everyone in the house entertained. One of their favorite tricks is using their long toes to open doors and cupboards. And if you're up for a game of fetch or chase, chances are, they are, too!\n\nAs you might expect, Sphynx are temperature-sensitive. If the house is chilly, they'll seek out a warmer place to nap. As such, these cats are good candidates for fashionable winter sweaters.","care-nutrition":"Sphynx have very high metabolisms and need to consume more calories than cats with coats. So, a high-quality diet is essential. To meet their nutritional needs, feed a diet appropriate for their life stage (e.g., kitten, adult, senior).\n\nBecause of their big appetites, Sphynx may try to convince you that they need an extra helping of kibble or some additional treats. To avoid overfeeding them (which can lead to obesity), measure out their meals and limit treats to no more than 10% of their daily calories.\n\nIn addition to daily meals, make sure your cat always has access to fresh, clean water.","care-grooming":"Despite their lack of coat, Sphynx do require bathing with a gentle shampoo to remove oily build-up on their skin. But be careful not to bathe too often, or you'll risk throwing off their natural PH balance. One bath every few months is plenty.\n\nPay special attention to your cat's nail beds, nose, and ears, too, as these places also collect debris. Sphynx need weekly ear cleanings to remove wax build-up and regular nail trims. Nails that get too long are more likely to snag on something and become torn or damaged. Overgrown nails can also grow into your cat's paw pads, leading to pain or infection. Besides clipping, providing a scratching post will help keep their nails in good shape and satisfy their instinct to scratch.\n\nLike all cats, Sphynx should have a dental care routine that includes at-home teeth brushing and professional dental exams and cleanings.","care-exercise":null,"care-training":null,"care-health":"Some breeds are more susceptible to certain health conditions.

This inspired her to cross a striped domestic cat and a Bengal to create a new cat breed that looked like a miniature tiger but acted like a house cat.\n\nJudy envisioned a long-bodied cat with a coat of bold, branched vertical stripes in a random pattern. Two other breeders—Anthony Hutcherson and Alice McKee—joined her. And over time, their efforts paid off.\n\nIn 1993, TICA accepted the Toyger (toy tiger) for registration and granted it Championship status in 2007.","facts":"Toygers pair the exotic appearance of a wild tiger with the personality of an easy-going domestic cat. They're confident, intelligent, and thrive on human companionship.","traits-appearance":"Toygers are medium-sized cats with long, muscular bodies. Sleek and big-boned, they move with confidence and athleticism.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Toyger's beautiful coat is short but thick. The hair of the markings can be slightly longer than the hair of the body color. As with a tiger's coat, dark stripes provide a stark contrast to a bright orange background, and facial markings form a circular pattern. Gold glitter scattered over the top of the coat adds to the breed's dramatic appearance.","traits-physical":"A Toyger's key features include a long, broad head, small rounded ears, small, circular eyes, robust body, and long, muscular tail.","temperament":"Toygers are friendly, laid-back cats that love spending time with their human families. They quickly adapt to most households and get along great with other pets.\n\nActive by nature, Toygers need plenty of exercise. They enjoy playing, chasing, solving food puzzles, and participating in games of fetch. They're also an intelligent, outgoing breed that can learn to take leashed walks in the neighborhood.\n\nDespite being energetic, Toygers are happy to curl up in a lap. And when they want affection from their people, they don't hesitate to vocalize their wishes. Because of their need for companionship, they may struggle if left alone for long periods.","care-nutrition":"Toygers require a high-quality diet formulated for their current life stage (e.g., kitten, adult, senior).\n\nRoughly one out of every three cats in the United States is overweight or obese. Since those extra pounds can contribute to other serious health issues, it's essential to keep your cat at a proper weight. To avoid overfeeding, measure out meals and reduce portions if necessary. And be sure to account for treats. As a guideline, they should make up no more than 10% of a cat's calories.\n\nLastly, all cats need access to fresh, clean water around the clock.","care-grooming":"Toygers are good self-groomers, so bathing is rarely necessary. A weekly once-over with a comb is typically all it takes to keep their coats clean and free of loose fur. But during periods of seasonal shedding, you may need to brush more frequently.\n\nEar cleaning and nail trims are also important parts of a comprehensive grooming routine. Check your cat's ears regularly for wax buildup or debris, and clip their claws monthly. Long nails are more likely to snag on something and become torn or damaged. They can even grow into your cat's paw pads, leading to pain or infection. In addition to clipping, providing a scratching post will allow your cat to do some nail maintenance themselves (thanks to their instinct to scratch).\n\nAnd don't forget those teeth. Good dental hygiene is essential to a Toyger's lifelong health. Ideally, dental care should include daily at-home teeth brushing along with periodic exams and professional cleanings.","care-exercise":null,"care-training":null,"care-health":"Some breeds are more susceptible to certain health conditions.

Stories suggest the breed came about when Romans brought their dogs to Spain and crossed them with native Catalan dogs. The resulting dogs worked with shepherds, helping guard and herd their livestock.\n\nUnique and still relatively rare, Catalan Sheepdogs worked in the Spanish Civil War as messengers and sentry dogs. Their popularity fell after World War II. But selective breeding programs in the 1970s helped the breed recover. Today, Catalan Sheepdogs are popular in their native Spain, and their numbers continue to grow in Germany, Sweden, and Finland.\n\nThe United Kennel Club recognized the Catalan Sheepdog in 2006. Three years later, the Kennel Club recognized the breed and added it to the import register as a working dog.","facts":"The Catalan Sheepdog is an alert, courageous working dog and a loyal, affectionate family pet. Add to that the breed's cheerful attitude, adorable facial hair, and friendly smile, and it's easy to see why these dogs are growing in popularity!","traits-appearance":"The Catalan Sheepdog is medium-sized with balanced proportions and a sweet, smiling face.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The breed has a luxurious straight or slightly wavy double coat. When they blow their coats, Catalan Sheepdogs first shed hair on the front half of their bodies only. For a brief period—before the back half takes its turn shedding—the dogs appear to have two different coats.\n\nThe Catalan Sheepdog's coat is sable, fawn, or grey and often mixed with reddish-brown, black, or white hairs.","traits-physical":"These dogs sport adorable beards, mustaches, and tufted eyebrows. The breed also has wide, expressive eyes, an alert, intelligent gaze, and a long, low, furry tail. (Some Catalan Sheepdogs naturally have no tails.)","temperament":"Catalan Sheepdogs are good-natured, energetic working dogs. These courageous pups possess a natural desire to care for their sheep and an ability to make instinctual decisions when monitoring the flock. They're also well-suited to work in any weather conditions—it's never too hot, too wet, or too chilly for these dogs to do their jobs.\n\nAt home, Catalan Sheepdogs make loyal family members. They're usually good with children (provided adults supervise) and friendly with other dogs and pets. They can, however, be wary of strangers.","care-nutrition":"Catalan Sheepdogs need a diet formulated for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). A food made specifically for medium-size breeds will have the appropriate blend of nutrients for their size and activity level.\n\nSince all dogs are at risk for obesity if they eat too many calories, carefully monitor the amount of food you give your pup. Portion out their meals with a measuring cup to prevent overfeeding, and limit treats to no more than 10% of their calories.","care-grooming":"You should brush your Catalan Sheepdog's coat a few times a week to prevent mats and tangles. During seasonal shedding periods, you may need to brush daily to keep the hair under control (and off your sofa).\n\nNail trims and ear cleanings are also important parts of any dog's grooming routine. Lastly, make sure you keep your pup on a life-long dental care program that includes at-home teeth brushing and professional cleanings.","care-exercise":"Catalan Sheepdogs are working dogs by nature. That means they need plenty of exercise and mental stimulation every day. Long walks, runs, and romps in the backyard are excellent ways to keep them active. Dog sports—such as agility, rally, and obedience—are also productive outlets for the breed's high energy and intelligence.","care-training":"Catalan Sheepdogs are smart, hard-working canines that respond well to training. Positive reinforcement and consistency are the best tools for teaching this breed commands and tricks.\n\nIn addition to obedience training, early socialization is a crucial step of raising a well-behaved dog. So, be sure to introduce your pup to different people, places, and situations when they are young to help them grow into a friendly, predictable adult dog.","care-health":null,"references":"http://www.fci.be/Nomenclature/Standards/087g01-en.pdf\n\nhttps://catalansheepdogclub.co.uk/about-catalan-sheepdogs/\n","reviewed-by":"Laura Inman, DVM","date-reviewed":"2020-09-05T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":17.0,"weight-range-pet-max":24.9,"weight-range-show-min":17.0,"weight-range-show-max":24.9,"height-range-min":43.0,"height-range-max":48.0,"life-span-range-min":12.0,"life-span-range-max":14.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":null,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":null,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":null},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a9b5d135-12c4-50e3-b75a-3ddd10be595b/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a9b5d135-12c4-50e3-b75a-3ddd10be595b/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a9b5d135-12c4-50e3-b75a-3ddd10be595b/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a9b5d135-12c4-50e3-b75a-3ddd10be595b/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a9b5d135-12c4-50e3-b75a-3ddd10be595b/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a9b5d135-12c4-50e3-b75a-3ddd10be595b/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a9b5d135-12c4-50e3-b75a-3ddd10be595b/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a9b5d135-12c4-50e3-b75a-3ddd10be595b/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a9b5d135-12c4-50e3-b75a-3ddd10be595b/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a9b5d135-12c4-50e3-b75a-3ddd10be595b/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a9b5d135-12c4-50e3-b75a-3ddd10be595b/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a9b5d135-12c4-50e3-b75a-3ddd10be595b/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a9b5d135-12c4-50e3-b75a-3ddd10be595b/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a9b5d135-12c4-50e3-b75a-3ddd10be595b/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a9b5d135-12c4-50e3-b75a-3ddd10be595b/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a9b5d135-12c4-50e3-b75a-3ddd10be595b/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a9b5d135-12c4-50e3-b75a-3ddd10be595b/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/a9b5d135-12c4-50e3-b75a-3ddd10be595b/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"aa09cf5e-7387-5ff1-a9c8-668093fbfc60","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/aa09cf5e-7387-5ff1-a9c8-668093fbfc60"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"dachshund-shorthaired","name":"Shorthaired Dachshund","plural-name":"Shorthaired Dachshunds","published-at":null,"species":"dog","history":"The Dachshund dates back to the 15th century. Though some evidence suggests the breed was present in Greece, Egypt, China, and Mexico, many experts believe it originated in Germany. Originally created to hunt badgers, Dachshunds were also successful big-game hunters.\n\nThe shorthaired (or smooth) variety is the original breed in the Dachshund family. The breed was later diversified to create the [Wirehaired](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/dachshund-wirehaired) and [Longhaired](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/dachshund-longhaired) types, as well as miniaturized sizes of all three.\n\nThe Shorthaired Dachshund came to the United States in 1885 and simultaneously received American Kennel Club recognition.","facts":"As the first breed in a diversified Dachshund family, the Shorthaired Dachshund is a true original. Like all Doxies, this breed is alert, lively, and active. The Shorthaired Dachshund's protective natures make it a vigilant watch dog.","traits-appearance":"Because of its long body and very short legs, the Shorthaired Dachshund is sometimes referred to as a \"hot dog\" or \"wiener dog.\"","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The coat of the Shorthaired Dachshund comes in various colors — including solid or bicolor combinations of light and dark black, red, and tan shades. Brindle and dapple patterns are also possible. Their sleek, short hair should not be too long or thick. Some Shorthaired Doxies have blue eyes.","traits-physical":"Shorthaired Dachshunds have instantly recognizable long-backed bodies. And they're famous for their pointy noses and short (but powerful) legs.","temperament":"The Shorthaired Dachshund is a friendly, affectionate breed that wants to spend its time surrounded by family. These pups want to be in on the action, not left alone outdoors.\n\nDoxies often bark, scratch at the ground, dig, or chase wildlife, thanks to their hunting dog heritage. They are also sometimes suspicious or fearful of strangers. This may be because they're trying to avoid being picked up, which can cause discomfort to their long-backed body.","care-nutrition":"Dachshunds need high-quality dog food appropriate for their age and breed size. Take care not to overfeed this breed. In addition to other health concerns, any extra weight strains their long backs, potentially leading to disc problems.","care-grooming":"The Shorthaired Dachshund is a clean breed, with little or no smell. They do need their nails clipped regularly, as overgrown nails can cause pain or lead to issues walking.","care-exercise":"Not every activity is appropriate or safe for Shorthaired Dachshunds due to their unique build. For instance, you should avoid long runs, hurdling fences, and vigorous swims. That said, this active breed is always eager to get out and have some fun in other ways.\n\nIn fact, Doxies need regular exercise to stay in shape and build the muscles needed to protect their backs. Just steer clear of activities that involve jumping or climbing stairs to prevent injuries.","care-training":"With their keen sense of smell and strong prey drive, Shorthaired Dachshunds may choose to pick up a scent and follow it rather than obey instructions. So, patience is a virtue while training this independent breed. A kind tone and positive, reward-based approach are the best tools for training these sensitive dogs.\n\nShorthaired Dachshunds tend to be protective of their family and territory.

Bobtail","plural-name":null,"published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"cat","history":"The American Bobtail developed through natural selection for decades before a formal breeding program launched in the late 1960s. Detailed information about the American Bobtail's earliest years is lacking. But breeders initially used cats with naturally occurring bobbed tails as the breed's foundation stock. Many people believe a cat named Yodi is the patriarch of the American Bobtail.\n\nA couple traveling through Arizona found Yodi— a tabby cat with a short tail—on a Native American Reservation. They decided to keep him and brought him home to Iowa. Yodi and the couple's female cat mated, producing a litter of short-tailed kittens. Those kittens were crossed with a longhaired color point cat, creating (potentially) the first true American Bobtails.\n\nToday, both the Cat Fanciers Association and The International Cat Association recognize the American Bobtail.","facts":"American Bobtails have a wild cat appearance and affectionate personality. They are a devoted, playful breed that can provide both entertainment and emotional support.","traits-appearance":"The American Bobtail is a medium-to-large cat with a naturally short tail. They have an athletic, muscular build and a hunter's gaze that give the breed a wild cat appearance.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"American Bobtails come in both longhaired and shorthaired varieties. But the shorthaired's coat is actually medium-length. It's also a double coat—with a hard topcoat and soft, downy undercoat.\n\nLonghaired Bobtails have medium-long, slightly shaggy hair that's somewhat longer on the ruff, britches, belly, and tail. They have a double coat, as well, though the undercoat is not very dense.\n\nBoth Bobtail types come in all colors and patterns.","traits-physical":"American Bobtails have a wedge-shaped head, prominent cheekbones, and distinctive brow. Their large, almond-shaped eyes come in all colors. Their ears are medium-sized, with a wide base and rounded tips. (Many  Bobtails also have ear furnishings.) And their most notable feature, of course, is a bobbed tail—which is broad at the base and long enough to be visible above the back when alert.","temperament":"American Bobtails are friendly, engaging cats that form tight bonds with their humans. They typically get along with kids and dogs and are eager to greet visitors.\n\nAffectionate and devoted (without being needy), Bobtails like to be near their people but aren't overly demanding of attention. They're also generally quiet—communicating mostly through soft trills or chirps.\n\nBoth athletic and playful, the Bobtail is always up for some fun. Their favorite activities often include games of fetch, hide-and-seek, and strolling through the neighborhood on a leash. They also enjoy showing off their innate hunting skills by stalking, pouncing, or capturing a fly in mid-air.\n\nThanks to their easy-going nature and clown-like antics, Bobtails make excellent therapy cats capable of brightening anybody's day.","care-nutrition":"Bobtails require a high-quality diet. Because nutritional needs vary for kittens, adults, and senior cats, opt for a formula that's age-appropriate for your pet.\n\nTo keep your cat at a healthy weight, measure out meals and reduce portions if necessary. And don't forget to account for calories from treats in their daily totals. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of a cat's calories.\n\nFinally, all cats need access to fresh, clean water at all times.","care-grooming":"Both longhaired and shorthaired Bobtails are relatively easy to groom. For most of the year, brushing them once or twice a week is enough to remove loose hair and—in the case of the longhaired cats—prevent tangles. During periods of seasonal shedding, you may need to brush more frequently.\n\nMost cats' nails require monthly trimming to prevent them from getting too long. Long nails are more likely to snag on something and become torn or damaged. They can even grow into your cat's paw pads, leading to pain or infection. In addition to clipping, providing a scratching post will allow your cat to do some nail maintenance themselves (thanks to their instinct to scratch).\n\nDental hygiene is another essential component of your cat's care. Beginning in kittenhood, start your Bobtail on a routine that includes at-home teeth brushing and regular visits to the veterinarian for professional dental cleanings and exams.","care-exercise":null,"care-training":null,"care-health":"Roughly one out of every three cats in the United States is overweight or obese. And those extra pounds can contribute to other health risks—such as arthritis, diabetes, and heart problems. Your veterinarian is the best resource for tips on managing your cat's weight.","references":"https://cfa.org/american-bobtail/\n\nhttps://cfa.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/american-bobtail-standard.pdf\n\nhttps://tica.org/breeds/browse-all-breeds?view=article&id=815:american-bobtail-breed&catid=79\n\nhttps://www.worldcatcongress.org/wp/cat_breed_comp_abs.php\n\nhttps://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/cat-breeds/american-bobtail\n\nhttps://www.banfield.com/state-of-pet-health/obesity","reviewed-by":"Annette

Coon","plural-name":null,"published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"cat","history":"The Maine Coon's name is a nod to both the breed's history and appearance. A native of Maine (and the official state cat), the Maine Coon is one of the oldest cat breeds in North America. There are many myths about how the breed got its start, ranging from plausible to downright fanciful.\n\nOne favorite legend is that domestic cats mated with raccoons and produced a cat with a bushy tail and brown tabby coloring. Though this is genetically impossible, the breed's likeness to raccoons earned it the name Maine Coon. The most likely theory about the breed's origin is that shorthaired domestic cats mated with longhaired cats brought to the area by New England seamen or Vikings in the 1850s.\n\nPeople favored Maine Coons for their rugged appearance and keen mousing skills. But their popularity skyrocketed when they became America's first native show cat. Their popularity faded in the mid-20th century—when other longhaired breeds arrived in the United States. In fact, Maine Coons bordered on extinction. Fortunately, dedicated breeders worked diligently to bring the breed back to its former glory.","facts":"The Maine Coon is a gentle giant. Equal parts rugged and beautiful, this breed makes a great family pet thanks to its gentle disposition and love of people.","traits-appearance":"Maine Coons are large, stocky cats with shaggy coats that protect them in harsh weather. They have a robust, balanced appearance with good muscle tone, a broad chest, and substantial legs.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Maine Coon's dense, textured coat is short on the head, shoulders, and legs and longer down the back and sides. Long belly fur, shaggy trousers on their hind legs, and a frill around the neck protect them from the elements (and makes them pretty cute). Their tails are broad at the base and taper at the tip, though the shape can be hard to see beneath the long, flowing hair.\n\nMaine Coons come in almost all colors and patterns, though the most common is the brown classic or mackerel tabby.","traits-physical":"Maine Coons have medium-sized, square heads and prominent cheekbones. Their large, well-tufted ears are wide at the base and taper to a point. They have broad chests and bodies that are long but proportionate, with a rectangular appearance. One of their most notable features is their large, expressive oval eyes.","temperament":"Maine Coons are an excellent breed for families, as they often get along well with other cats, kids, and dogs. Because of their gentle nature and good-natured personality, they also make good therapy cats.\n\nThough not generally the kind of cat that will curl up in your lap, Maine Coons do enjoy being around people. They like to hang out near their humans and will often follow them from room to room. They've earned a reputation as a friendly—but not overly demanding—companion. Maine Coons are also quiet cats that rarely meow. Instead, they'll get your attention with a soft (and endearing) chirp.\n\nUnlike some other cat breeds, Maine Coons tend to stay on the ground rather than jump and climb to high places. This preference makes them great candidates for a game of fetch!","care-nutrition":"Maine Coons require a high-quality diet. Because nutritional needs vary for kittens, adults, and senior cats, take care to choose a formula that's age-appropriate for your pet. You might also consider diets designed specifically for the Maine Coon's unique needs.\n\nAny cat can become overweight if they eat too much. To avoid overfeeding, carefully measure out your pet's food with a standard measuring cup and reduce portions if they gain weight. And don't overdo it on treats—no matter how many cute looks your cat gives you. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of their daily calories.\n\nIn addition to daily meals, make sure to provide plenty of fresh water for your cat at all times.","care-grooming":"The texture of a Maine Coon's coat impacts how often they require grooming. Cottony coats need daily brushing, while silky coats can go longer between grooming sessions. Regardless of the texture, all Maine Coons need regular grooming. On the plus side, this breed generally likes water and doesn't mind taking baths. (They're even pretty good swimmers!)\n\nMaine Coons often enjoy the attention that comes with being groomed. But if you don't share the same enthusiasm for the grooming routine, you can keep your Maine Coon's coat in a short \"lion cut\" that doesn't require frequent brushing.\n\nIn addition to coat maintenance, be sure to trim your Maine Coon's nails regularly. For kittens, this means once a week. Adult cats can go up to three weeks between trims. Nails that get too long are more likely to snag on something and become torn or damaged. Overgrown nails can also grow into your cat's paw pads, leading to pain or infection. Besides clipping, providing a scratching post can help keep their nails in good shape and satisfy their instinct to scratch.\n\nDental care is also an essential part of any cat's overall health. So, don't delay in starting your Maine Coon on a dental program that includes at-home teeth brushing and professional exams and cleanings by a veterinarian.","care-exercise":null,"care-training":null,"care-health":"Because of their large size, Maine Coons can be prone to joint issues such as hip dysplasia. In addition to keeping your cat at a healthy weight, ask your veterinarian about supplements that may improve joint health.","references":"https://tica.org/breeds/browse-all-breeds?view=article&id=853:maine-coon-breed&catid=79\n\nhttps://cfa.org/maine-coon-cat/\n\nhttp://www1.fifeweb.org/dnld/std/MCO.pdf\n\nhttps://cfa.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/maine-coon-standard.pdf\n\nhttps://tica.org/breeds/browse-all-breeds?view=article&id=1194:the-maine-coon-breed&catid=48\n\nhttps://www.banfield.com/pet-healthcare/pet-healthcare-resources/nutrition/food-amounts-and-helping-prevent-obesity","reviewed-by":"Jamie Freyer, DVM","date-reviewed":"2021-02-23T00:03:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":4.1,"weight-range-pet-max":10.0,"weight-range-show-min":null,"weight-range-show-max":null,"height-range-min":null,"height-range-max":null,"life-span-range-min":12.0,"life-span-range-max":15.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":null,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":null,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":null},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/ad7a67b3-ec21-57b8-bcc8-1da1513b0576/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/ad7a67b3-ec21-57b8-bcc8-1da1513b0576/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/ad7a67b3-ec21-57b8-bcc8-1da1513b0576/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/ad7a67b3-ec21-57b8-bcc8-1da1513b0576/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/ad7a67b3-ec21-57b8-bcc8-1da1513b0576/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/ad7a67b3-ec21-57b8-bcc8-1da1513b0576/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/ad7a67b3-ec21-57b8-bcc8-1da1513b0576/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/ad7a67b3-ec21-57b8-bcc8-1da1513b0576/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/ad7a67b3-ec21-57b8-bcc8-1da1513b0576/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/ad7a67b3-ec21-57b8-bcc8-1da1513b0576/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/ad7a67b3-ec21-57b8-bcc8-1da1513b0576/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/ad7a67b3-ec21-57b8-bcc8-1da1513b0576/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/ad7a67b3-ec21-57b8-bcc8-1da1513b0576/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/ad7a67b3-ec21-57b8-bcc8-1da1513b0576/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/ad7a67b3-ec21-57b8-bcc8-1da1513b0576/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/ad7a67b3-ec21-57b8-bcc8-1da1513b0576/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/ad7a67b3-ec21-57b8-bcc8-1da1513b0576/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/ad7a67b3-ec21-57b8-bcc8-1da1513b0576/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"addd489e-beb0-5335-89d2-13cb778cbf0c","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/addd489e-beb0-5335-89d2-13cb778cbf0c"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"korean-jindo","name":"Jindo","plural-name":"Jindo","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"Hailing from an island off the coast of South Korea, the Jindo is also called Jindo-kae and Jindo-kyon. (\"Kae\" and \"kyon\" are Korean words for \"dog.\") This breed has lived alongside humankind for thousands of years.\n\nExperts believe Jindos to be descendants of other spitz-type breeds. And they share the stamina, intelligence, and high prey drive of these ancestors—making them excellent hunting dogs.\n\nIn 1962, the Jindo earned the designation of Korean national treasure under the Republic of Korea Preservation of Cultural Assets.","facts":"The Jindo is an excellent hunter, guard dog, and faithful companion. Athletic dogs that require a lot of exercise, Jindos are also known for their loyalty, friendliness, and developing deep bonds with their people.","traits-appearance":"Jindos are medium-sized, well-proportioned dogs with pricked ears and curled tails. Their body language is alert and brave.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"These double-coated dogs have soft, lightly colored undercoats and stiff hair on their outer coats. Jindos can be red fawn, white, black, black and tan, wolf grey, or brindle.","traits-physical":"Jindos have high-set tails that curve like a sickle. When the breed's tail is down, the tip should touch the hocks.","temperament":"Jindos are smart, alert, dominant dogs that vie for the highest spot in the pack order. These confident canines will challenge inexperienced owners. The breed also develops strong bonds with its owner and tends to be a \"one-man dog,\" attached to a single person. For this reason, Jindos don't make the best family dogs.\n\nA combination of intelligence, strong predatory instincts, and desire to control (and expand) their territory makes Jindos master escape artists. They look for ways to break free of their enclosures and defend their territories from all perceived intruders. If a Jindo feels threatened, it will respond with deep, resounding barking.\n\nTheir relative unwillingness to accept new people means that Jindos do not do well in homes with many different people coming and going. The breed also prefers to be the master of its domain and may be reactionary toward other dogs. Though some Jindos accept other pets, you should avoid bringing a Jindo into a home with a strong alpha dog—especially a male. In multi-pet households, opposite-sex pairs are best.\n\nIn light of this, carefully consider whether you have the skill and patience to train this proud breed. Owners who are unprepared for the Jindo's unique personality and needs often end up surrendering or abandoning their dogs.\n\nThe same traits that make Jindos less-than-ideal family pets—their sense of loyalty and desire to protect their territories—lead them to excel as guard dogs.","care-nutrition":"A lean Jindo is not a sign that the dog is malnourished. These dogs tend to be light or picky eaters. Rather than freely feed a Jindo or add treats or high-value foods to their kibble—which can actually encourage picky eating—offer a high-quality dog food at scheduled meal times.","care-grooming":"Jindos have thick double coats that help repel dirt and water, keeping them from developing a \"dog\" smell. Despite being a clean breed, they do require regular grooming. Weekly brushings help remove shed fur. And extra grooming during seasonal shedding periods—when Jindos blow their coats—will help keep them looking good.\n\nJindos also require nail trims and often feel more relaxed when their owners handle the task. Routine [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) should include regular teeth brushing, as well as professional dental cleanings.","care-exercise":"When owners don't provide adequate exercise, the high-energy Jindo will find ways to satisfy its need to move (which may mean escaping). These dogs prefer high-intensity activities—such as hunting, lure coursing, and agility.\n\nSometimes used as sled dogs, Jindos welcome opportunities to work, especially in cold weather. Mental stimulation in the form of tricks or games is also important. On walks, be sure to use a strong leash and harness, and be prepared to restrain your Jindo if they see other dogs. Steer clear of the dog park for the same reasons.","care-training":"The breed has been described as \"too intelligent\" for some owners. But the same smarts that allow Jindos to learn how to open gates and crates also make them apt students.\n\nThis breed learns best with positive reinforcement. If training is too heavy-handed, Jindos may shut down. Untrained, they can exhibit unchecked dominance. [Early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) is essential to subdue this breed's guarding

Shepherd Dog","plural-name":"German Shepherd Dogs","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The modern-day German Shepherd breed is a cross between the long-haired, short-haired, and wire-haired shepherd dogs of the German regions of Württemberg, Thuringia, and Bavaria.\n\nInitially bred for herding, they became popular for many other jobs because of their strength, intelligence, and excellent temperament.\n\nMax Emil Von Stephanitz sought to protect and refine the German Shepherd breed at the end of the 19th century. German Shepherds were used as German police and military dogs during World Wars I and II. They were also very good at locating wounded soldiers, and Allied soldiers took notice. Some soldiers introduced the breed to their home countries, and the popularity of the German Shepherd took off around the world.\n\nThe German Shepherd was recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1908. From 1925-1936, it was the most popular dog breed in the U.S. Though it eventually lost this title, it remains one of the most well-known and popular breeds.\n\nToday, German Shepherds are just as likely to be loving, protective family dogs as they are working military or police dogs.","facts":"German Shepherds are good-natured, all-purpose workers. Their intelligence, alertness, courage, and loyalty have earned them roles as guard dogs, guide dogs, search and rescue dogs, and attentive family dogs.","traits-appearance":"German Shepherds are balanced and muscular dogs. They appear poised, confident, and always ready to work. This breed has a large, deep-chested, slightly elongated body with smooth curves (rather than an angular outline), and a firm overall structure.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The German Shepherd's coat comes in two varieties: the double coat and the long and harsh outer coat. Both varieties have an undercoat. The double coat is dense and close-fitting. It is typically short on the head and front legs, and longer on the neck and hind legs.\n\nThe long and harsh outer coat is long and soft, with tufts on the ears and legs. This creates a bushy tail and \"trousers.\" Longer hair on the neck almost gives the appearance of a mane.\n\nGerman Shepherds are generally a combination of black and tan, though more or less black may be seen. There is also a gray variant, where the tip of the hair is black, and the rest is tan. A black mask and saddle are common traits in this breed.\n\nThough not recognized by the AKC, all-white German Shepherd Dogs do exist under a separate breed name. And diluted color variants can occur in the German Shepherd, but they are considered faults under AKC's standards.","traits-physical":"The German Shepherd has erect, medium-size ears that are carried upright. Their eyes are almond-shaped, medium in size, and very dark in color. This breed has a strong upper and lower jaw and a scissor bite—where the incisors of the upper jaw overlap those of the lower jaw.","temperament":"German Shepherds are a great breed for families due to their devoted, loving, and affectionate personalities. They enjoy receiving lots of attention and companionship from their people, and love being included in family activities.\n\nGerman Shepherds are generally friendly towards children as long as they're not treated harshly. At times, they can become over-protective and unsure of or standoffish with strangers. [Socializing them early](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) can help them be more accepting of new people.\n\nIntelligence and alertness are common personality traits of German Shepherds. And these are the behavioral strengths that allow them to excel as service dogs for law enforcement, search and rescue, and disability assistance dogs. However, their personalities can vary. Some German Shepherds may be calm and watchful, whereas others might be more energetic.","care-nutrition":"German Shepherds need a high-quality food appropriate for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). They also benefit from diets that are formulated for large-breed dogs, particularly when they are puppies. Feeding a large-breed growth diet when they are young prevents them from growing too fast, which may decrease the likelihood or severity of hip dysplasia as they age.","care-grooming":"German Shepherds should be brushed every few days to keep their coat clean and free of loose hair. During periods of seasonal shedding—which typically occur once or twice a year—you will likely need to brush more frequently to keep the abundance of hair from overtaking your home.\n\nTrimming nails, cleaning ears, and [brushing teeth](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) should also be part of every dog's grooming routine, regardless of breed.","care-exercise":"German Shepherds are active dogs that like to keep busy and have jobs to do. That means they need frequent mental and physical exercise to stay happy. This can include daily walks, runs, play sessions, and puzzle toys.\n\nThey also enjoy participating in dog sports such as agility, tracking, flyball, and competitive obedience. These activities are not only good for their bodies but keep their minds sharp as well.\n\nLike any dog, if German Shepherds don't get an adequate amount of exercise they could become pent-up and frustrated. And that could lead to undesirable behaviors, such as destructive chewing.","care-training":"German Shepherds are eager to learn, and they respond well to reward-based training and instructions given in a firm and calm tone.\n\n[Ongoing training](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-obedience-training) is recommended, as it will reinforce obedience concepts and strengthen their bonding with their family. Dedicated training will also temper the German Shepherd's guarding tendency.","care-health":null,"references":"http://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/GermanShepherdDog.pdf\n\nhttp://www.fci.be/Nomenclature/Standards/166g01-en.pdf\n\nhttps://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/dog-breeds/german-shepherd\n\nhttps://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/german-shepherd-dog/","reviewed-by":"Annette

Bernard","plural-name":"Saint Bernards","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"Named after a Monk in the Swiss Alps, Bernard of Menthon, these dogs were created to rescue weary travelers. Established in 1050, The Saint Bernard saved people all along an 8,000-foot high pass for almost a thousand years.\n\nThe Swiss Alps saw particularly violent and harsh winters in 1816, 1817, and 1818. These dangerous conditions resulted in so many dogs giving their lives in service, the breed was almost driven to extinction. Monks were able to save the dogs by crossbreeding with [Newfoundlands](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/newfoundland), and they saw an increased popularity in the UK in 1820.\n\nThe British began breeding their own version of the Saint Bernard in 1820, and there are now two breeds recognized by the American Kennel Club: the Saint Bernard and the English Saint Bernard. These dogs have a deep-seated desire to protect and ensure the safety of their companions.","facts":"The Hollywood superstars of the dog world, these gentle giants make great nannies for children. Their caring and patient nature makes them a wonderful, but also massive, family member. They were bred to be mountain rescuers, and have an incredible history in the Swiss Alps.","traits-appearance":"A powerful workhorse of a dog, the Saint Bernard has a boisterous presence, and can be intimidating if not for their friendly and caring nature. They look intelligent, with a too-serious expression—like they are ready to save you at any instant!","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Bred in both longhaired and shorthaired varieties, Saint Bernards’ coats are thick, and will shed significantly once a year. They have white markings on their face and a white underbelly, while the rest of their coat is brown-yellow or red.","traits-physical":"There is no mistaking the famously massive head and huge frame of the Saint Bernard. Coming in both long and shorthair varieties, they are very loving and caring companions. With their huge skull, powerful limbs, and long bushy tail – the Saint Bernard’s empowering presence is impossible to miss.","temperament":"They have a playful and curious nature, but are always gentle. Saint Bernards can sometimes forget their size, and they love to snuggle with their owners. They do have some special care requirements, but they make excellent family members, particularly for families with young kids.","care-nutrition":"Saint Bernards will need a high-quality food specially formulated for large breeds. They are large dogs, and they can be prone to overeating. Obesity is a big health concern for Saint Bernards, and caloric intake should be monitored.\n\nBloat is also a problem prevalent in this breed, and can be life threatening. To help prevent bloat, break their food up into several meals a day, and use a food bowl that’s specially designed to slow their rate of eating. When timing meals, avoid feeding them immediately after any kind of vigorous activity, and wait at least an hour after meals before allowing them to run or exercise. These are just a few of the ways you can mitigate this life-threatening condition. A veterinarian is the best resource for other recommendations, including surgical options, for preventing bloat.","care-grooming":"The Saint Bernard’s thick, bushy coat needs weekly brushing, and baths as necessary. When they shed, they will need brushing daily. The nails can grow quickly and should be trimmed if they’re not worn down with exercise.\n\nAll dogs require regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care), including at-home teeth brushing and professional dental cleanings, and Saint Bernard is no exception. Maintaining good dental hygiene is important for their overall long-term health.","care-exercise":"They are quite happy with a long walk, or thirty minutes of play every day. They are always happy to take nice long hikes, or to spend a night under the stars camping with their people. Particularly good with children, they make great companions for growing families.","care-training":"To ensure the safety of your Saint Bernard, early socialization and puppy training are a must. Teaching them not to jump is also important—obedience training can assist with that. They love to please their owners, which makes them very responsive to positive-reinforcement training methods.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/st-bernard/\n\nhttps://saintbernardclub.org/history/\n\nhttp://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/SaintBernard.pdf","reviewed-by":"Annette Louviere, DVM","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":48.1,"weight-range-pet-max":84.4,"weight-range-show-min":54.9,"weight-range-show-max":90.7,"height-range-min":81.0,"height-range-max":91.0,"life-span-range-min":7.0,"life-span-range-max":10.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":80,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":47,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":32},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/aeb60dc3-3e08-51cb-a183-6673993692b0/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/aeb60dc3-3e08-51cb-a183-6673993692b0/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/aeb60dc3-3e08-51cb-a183-6673993692b0/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/aeb60dc3-3e08-51cb-a183-6673993692b0/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/aeb60dc3-3e08-51cb-a183-6673993692b0/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/aeb60dc3-3e08-51cb-a183-6673993692b0/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/aeb60dc3-3e08-51cb-a183-6673993692b0/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/aeb60dc3-3e08-51cb-a183-6673993692b0/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/aeb60dc3-3e08-51cb-a183-6673993692b0/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/aeb60dc3-3e08-51cb-a183-6673993692b0/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/aeb60dc3-3e08-51cb-a183-6673993692b0/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/aeb60dc3-3e08-51cb-a183-6673993692b0/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/aeb60dc3-3e08-51cb-a183-6673993692b0/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/aeb60dc3-3e08-51cb-a183-6673993692b0/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/aeb60dc3-3e08-51cb-a183-6673993692b0/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/aeb60dc3-3e08-51cb-a183-6673993692b0/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/aeb60dc3-3e08-51cb-a183-6673993692b0/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/aeb60dc3-3e08-51cb-a183-6673993692b0/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"afd48154-340b-594c-ab60-0118bf73c089","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/afd48154-340b-594c-ab60-0118bf73c089"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"terrier-brazileiro","name":"Brazilian Terrier","plural-name":"Brazilian Terriers","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The Brazilian Terrier (sometimes known as the Fox Paulistinha) is one of two breeds indigenous to Brazil. The exact origins of the breed are a mystery, but experts believe the European Jack Russell Terrier and Fox Terrier were involved. The Miniature Pinscher may have also played a role.\n\nBrazilian plantation owners use these little dogs to protect their crops from vermin. But the Brazilian Terrier is still virtually unknown outside of its native country. The UK and American Kennel Club do not currently recognize the breed.","facts":"The Brazilian Terrier is an alert, playful breed. Typically friendly, these devoted family dogs will let you know when they want attention. And when well-trained, they make excellent companions and pets.","traits-appearance":"The Brazilian Terrier has a slim, small-to-medium build, and well-balanced body.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Brazilian Terriers have a short, smooth, fine coat that's predominantly white with black, brown, or blue markings. The breed has tan markings above the eyes, on either side of the muzzle, and the inside and edges of the ear.","traits-physical":"Notable traits in the Brazilian Terrier include its triangular-shaped head, low set tail, and narrow chest.","temperament":"The Brazilian Terrier is an energetic, independent, and entertaining dog. Though these dogs are friendly and gentle to people they know, they can be wary of strangers. They're very vocal dogs that will bark at intruders, so they make good watchdogs. Brazilian Terriers may be small, but they're fearless\n\nThis breed is good around well-behaved children (i.e., kids who aren't ear- or tail-pullers). Still, when young ones are around, adults should be, too. Due to its hunting background, the Brazilian Terrier has a strong prey drive and likes to chase small animals.\n\nPlayful and energetic, these pups require plenty of physical exercise and mental stimulation.","care-nutrition":"Brazilian Terriers require a high-quality dog food that is age-appropriate and formulated for their small size. As with any dog, it's important to monitor the amount of food you give them and reduce portions if your pup gains weight. Also, keep in mind that giving too many treats in addition to regular meals can contribute to obesity.","care-grooming":"Grooming a Brazilian Terrier is relatively easy. Brushing its coat a few times a week is enough to keep its moderate shedding under control.","care-exercise":"Brazilian Terriers are active dogs and can become restless if they don't get enough exercise. Long daily walks or play sessions in a fenced backyard are good ways for them to burn energy. They also like to participate in dog sports such as agility, rally, or competitive obedience.\n\nBecause of their high exercise requirements, apartments and homes with limited space are not the best choices for Brazilian Terriers.","care-training":"The Brazilian Terrier is a very trainable (though occasionally stubborn) breed. However, they can be destructive if they get bored or are left alone for long periods. Proper training—along with physical and mental exercise—help keep behavioral problems at bay.\n\nBecause of their high intelligence, Brazillian Terriers are good candidates for obedience and agility training.

from the Middle Ages. As these dogs made their way into Belgium, they developed characteristics that made them better at pulling carts. But with the introduction of the automobile, this first iteration of the Belgium Mastiff eventually disappeared.\n\nIn the late 1980s, G. Glineue de Boussu and Alfons Bertels started a reconstruction program for the breed. They crossed rural dogs believed to be descendants of the original \"Matin Belge\" with English Mastiffs, Bullmastiffs, Briards, and Belgian Sheepdogs. Unfortunately, this more recent incarnation of the breed has also all but vanished.\n\nThough some groups claim efforts are underway to revive the breed again, Belgian Mastiffs are considered extinct, and the FCI no longer recognizes the breed.","facts":"The Belgian Mastiff is a brave, intelligent, and hardworking breed. Though not known to be overly friendly, these devoted dogs are loyal to their families.","traits-appearance":"The Belgian Mastiff is a massive dog with an athletic and almost imposing muscular build.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Belgian Mastiffs have short, sleek coats that are usually reddish-brown, brindle, fawn, or black. Some feature white markings and—every once in a while—a dark mask.","traits-physical":"Along with impressive body strength, the Belgian Mastiff has a large head, strong neck, and deep, wide chest.","temperament":"Belgian Mastiffs are loyal, dutiful, and obedient companions. They are even-tempered and athletic, with good guarding instincts. These dogs love their families and are fearless in protecting them and tireless in working for them.\n\nBecause they are natural guardians, Belgian Mastiffs tend to be wary of strangers and can sometimes be reactive toward other animals. So, early socialization is vital to help them develop into well-mannered dogs. With the right training, these dogs make devoted pets.","care-nutrition":"Belgian Mastiffs need high-quality food formulated for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). They also benefit from diets designed for large dogs—particularly when they're young. This helps prevent them from growing too fast and developing skeletal problems.","care-grooming":"The Belgian Mastiff's short coat requires brushing just a couple of times a week to stay looking its best. (You'll likely need to increase the frequency during seasonal shedding periods.)\n\nNail trims, ear cleanings, and regular dental care—including at-home teeth brushing and professional cleanings—should also be part of their grooming routines.","care-exercise":"Belgian Mastiffs are working dogs that need plenty of regular exercise. They seem to enjoy daily walks and romps in the backyard. But avoid long-distance runs or vigorous exercise until your dog is past the puppy phase and their bones and joints have developed.","care-training":"Belgian Mastiffs are obedient and easy to train. They respond well to positive, reward-based methods. Beyond basic training, be sure to provide early socialization to help prevent or reduce fear-based defensive behaviors.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.dogbreedinfo.com/belgianmastiff.htm\n\nhttps://www.dog-learn.com/dog-breeds/belgian-mastiff/\n","reviewed-by":"Annette Louviere, DVM","date-reviewed":"2020-09-05T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":45.4,"weight-range-pet-max":72.6,"weight-range-show-min":45.4,"weight-range-show-max":72.6,"height-range-min":69.0,"height-range-max":81.0,"life-span-range-min":6.0,"life-span-range-max":12.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":null,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":null,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":null},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b0982fd0-fb5a-5f88-86bd-3f14c8ba6be6/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b0982fd0-fb5a-5f88-86bd-3f14c8ba6be6/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b0982fd0-fb5a-5f88-86bd-3f14c8ba6be6/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b0982fd0-fb5a-5f88-86bd-3f14c8ba6be6/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b0982fd0-fb5a-5f88-86bd-3f14c8ba6be6/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b0982fd0-fb5a-5f88-86bd-3f14c8ba6be6/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b0982fd0-fb5a-5f88-86bd-3f14c8ba6be6/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b0982fd0-fb5a-5f88-86bd-3f14c8ba6be6/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b0982fd0-fb5a-5f88-86bd-3f14c8ba6be6/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b0982fd0-fb5a-5f88-86bd-3f14c8ba6be6/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b0982fd0-fb5a-5f88-86bd-3f14c8ba6be6/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b0982fd0-fb5a-5f88-86bd-3f14c8ba6be6/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b0982fd0-fb5a-5f88-86bd-3f14c8ba6be6/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b0982fd0-fb5a-5f88-86bd-3f14c8ba6be6/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b0982fd0-fb5a-5f88-86bd-3f14c8ba6be6/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b0982fd0-fb5a-5f88-86bd-3f14c8ba6be6/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b0982fd0-fb5a-5f88-86bd-3f14c8ba6be6/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b0982fd0-fb5a-5f88-86bd-3f14c8ba6be6/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"b0de0723-f6c2-5970-a198-f05a352c1bda","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b0de0723-f6c2-5970-a198-f05a352c1bda"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"american-foxhound","name":"American Foxhound","plural-name":"American Foxhounds","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"One of the first breeds the American Kennel Club ever recognized, the American Foxhound can trace its roots back to 1886.\n\nHistorical records suggest George Washington was an avid fox hunter. For this hobby, he kept hounds descended from imported British dogs. Eventually, he crossed these hounds with French breeding stock from Marquis de Lafayette—a French aristocrat and military officer who fought in the American Revolutionary War.\n\nFrom there, what would become the American Foxhound continued to evolve throughout the post-Colonial period, especially in the South. Eventually, it became its own breed, completely separate from its English Foxhound ancestor.\n\nThe American Foxhound is currently the state dog of Virginia, where it began its American journey.","facts":"Raised to hunt, the American Foxhound is typically a low-maintenance, social breed—a good companion for families and people with other pets. American Foxhounds need plenty of exercise and attention. Without it, they tend to become depressed, which can lead to trouble.","traits-appearance":"The American Foxhound has a moderately long, muscular and strong body with large eyes and a gentle, pleading expression.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The American Foxhound has a close, hard coat of medium length. It’s traditionally black and tan with white, or mostly white with black and tan.","traits-physical":"American Foxhounds have fairly long, slightly domed skulls, with low and long-reaching ears, and large eyes that are set far apart. Their muscular shoulders are sloped, and their hips and thighs are strong.","temperament":"Like most hounds, the American Foxhound excels at hunting and chasing. After all, they’ve been bred to spend hours doing so. In the absence of a daylong hunt, keeping this energetic breed happy usually requires at least an hour or two of stimulating exercise each day.\n\nWith the proper amount of exercise, this breed is intelligent and good-humored, with all the makings of an excellent pet. But without it, the American Foxhound may get into trouble—channeling all that anxious energy into destructive behaviors.\n\nThe breed is also known for its loud howls that, in an apartment or city setting, can be very intrusive. [Early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) and training can help them be friendly toward strangers and other animals and reduce their tendency to howl.","care-nutrition":"As an active and energetic breed, the American Foxhound requires a high-quality dog food that’s suited to their particular age—as well as any additional health concerns.\n\nYou should monitor the amount of food and treats that you give your American Foxhound, especially since they love to eat and are prone to becoming overweight. Your veterinarian is always a good source for appropriate nutrition and feeding guidelines.","care-grooming":"The American Foxhound has a short coat with a hard texture that’s easy to care for. Weekly grooming sessions with a bristle brush or grooming mitt should be all you need to handle stray hairs and keep shedding at bay. Bathing isn’t usually necessary, either, unless your Foxhound has gotten into something outside.\n\nAll dogs require regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care), including at-home teeth brushing and professional dental cleanings, and American Foxhound is no exception. Maintaining good dental hygiene is important for their overall long-term health.","care-exercise":"Before you get an American Foxhound, it’s essential to first consider the exercise requirements necessary to keep this breed happy and healthy. In the absence of long hunts, American Foxhounds need a couple of hours of daily activity.\n\nSince they love being with their people, long walks or hikes are a fun way to meet this exercise quota. But remember to always keep your Foxhound on a leash in areas that aren’t fenced. Once this breed finds a scent it would like to track, it can be incredibly difficult to get a Foxhound back.\n\nBesides walks and hikes, this breed also enjoys canine sports like tracking and course ability tests.","care-training":"Noble and affectionate, the American Foxhound has two sides. They tend to be easygoing, but can also be independent and exhibit streaks of stubbornness. So, a little patience is key when it comes to these dogs. Maintaining a strict exercise schedule is arguably the best way to keep them from misbehaving.\n\nBeyond that, [obedience training](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-obedience-training) can help reinforce desired behaviors while providing mental exercise. American Foxhounds that are properly trained and exercised are often mild-tempered, loving pets that get along with children and other animals alike.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/american-foxhound/\n\nhttp://www.fci.be/Nomenclature/Standards/303g06-en.pdf\n\nhttp://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/AmericanFoxhound.pdf\n\nhttps://www.westminsterkennelclub.org/breeds/american-foxhound/","reviewed-by":"Cindy Elston, DVM, MPH","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":19.1,"weight-range-pet-max":30.4,"weight-range-show-min":18.1,"weight-range-show-max":29.5,"height-range-min":53.0,"height-range-max":64.0,"life-span-range-min":11.0,"life-span-range-max":13.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":101,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":65,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":43},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b0de0723-f6c2-5970-a198-f05a352c1bda/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b0de0723-f6c2-5970-a198-f05a352c1bda/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b0de0723-f6c2-5970-a198-f05a352c1bda/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b0de0723-f6c2-5970-a198-f05a352c1bda/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b0de0723-f6c2-5970-a198-f05a352c1bda/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b0de0723-f6c2-5970-a198-f05a352c1bda/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b0de0723-f6c2-5970-a198-f05a352c1bda/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b0de0723-f6c2-5970-a198-f05a352c1bda/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b0de0723-f6c2-5970-a198-f05a352c1bda/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b0de0723-f6c2-5970-a198-f05a352c1bda/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b0de0723-f6c2-5970-a198-f05a352c1bda/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b0de0723-f6c2-5970-a198-f05a352c1bda/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b0de0723-f6c2-5970-a198-f05a352c1bda/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b0de0723-f6c2-5970-a198-f05a352c1bda/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b0de0723-f6c2-5970-a198-f05a352c1bda/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b0de0723-f6c2-5970-a198-f05a352c1bda/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b0de0723-f6c2-5970-a198-f05a352c1bda/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b0de0723-f6c2-5970-a198-f05a352c1bda/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"b1361f4b-0f7a-5d49-b0d2-cb1941cbacd2","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b1361f4b-0f7a-5d49-b0d2-cb1941cbacd2"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"american-water-spaniel","name":"American Water Spaniel","plural-name":"American Water Spaniels","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"American Water Spaniels originated around the mid-nineteenth century. There’s some dispute about which mix of breeds they came from, with candidates ranging from the English Water Spaniel to the Curly Coated Retriever.\n\nThough its exact origins aren’t known, the reason for developing the breed is. Hunters in the Midwestern United States—probably in the areas of the Fox River and Wolf River valleys of Wisconsin—wanted an all-in-one hunting dog. They needed a dog that could function on land as well as in the marsh, while comfortably fitting into a canoe or boat without taking up much room. So, it’s not surprising that the American Water Spaniel has gained the reputation of being an excellent hunter and farm dog over the years.\n\nThe breed reached its peak of popularity sometime between the 1920s and 1930s, after which time its numbers started to dwindle. Fortunately, breed enthusiasts have managed to maintain a reasonable population that is not likely to disappear anytime soon. That said, American Water Spaniels are relatively rare outside of America’s Great Lakes region.\n\nThe American Kennel Club formally recognized American Water Spaniel in 1940; Wisconsin later dubbed it the state dog in 1985.","facts":"The American Water Spaniel is an intelligent, upbeat, athletic breed that excels at hunting and retrieving. These eager bundles of energy are friendly, affectionate, and playful—all of which make them loving companions.","traits-appearance":"The American Water Spaniel is a muscular, solidly built, medium-sized dog with an alert, self-confident expression.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The American Water Spaniel is known for its coat, which may be marcel (uniform “S” shape waves) or tightly curled. The number of waves or curls may vary from one part of the dog’s body to another. American Water Spaniels also have an undercoat that’s dense enough to protect them from water and inclement weather.\n\nThe coat may be various shades of brown, from liver to dark chocolate. Small white markings on the toes and chest are also possible.","traits-physical":"The American Water Spaniel is slightly longer than it is tall, with a body that’s not too square or compact. The ears of an American Water Spaniel are set slightly above the eye line, but not too high on the head. They are lobular-shaped and long and wide, with leather (i.e., the ear lobe) extending to nose. The tail is moderate in length and curved in a rocker fashion, and covered to the tip with moderately feathered hair.","temperament":"American Water Spaniels are intelligent, playful, and energetic dogs. They are excellent with children and typically friendly towards other pets, which makes them a welcome addition to many families—provided you can keep them well-exercised.\n\nThese sporty dogs need plenty of activity and enjoy staying active with their human companions. Their keen sense of smell combined with expert retrieving and swimming skills make them excellent hunters. However, this also means they tend to bark a lot.\n\nThough typically happy, eager, and charming, American Water Spaniels can be aloof with people they don’t know. They can also have a bit of a stubborn streak.","care-nutrition":"American Water Spaniels should eat high-quality food meant for their specific life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). A diet formulated specifically for medium-sized dogs may also be appropriate.\n\nTo keep their weight in a healthy range, you should closely monitor their food intake. Avoid accidental overfeeding by portioning out food with a standard measuring cup. And don’t forget to account for treats when considering their daily calories. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of a dog’s calories each day.","care-grooming":"American Water Spaniels are relatively low-shedding compared to other breeds. Weekly brushing to keep their coats clean and healthy will typically suffice. However, more frequent brushing may be necessary during periods of seasonal shedding.\n\nTrimming nails, cleaning ears, and [brushing teeth](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) should also be part of every dog's grooming routine, regardless of breed.","care-exercise":"Due to their backgrounds as active hunters and swimmers, American Water Spaniels need plenty of regular exercise to keep them happy. If they don’t get enough exercise, they may respond with nuisance barking or destructive behaviors.\n\nAmerican Water Spaniels enjoy vigorous play sessions in the backyard or at the dog park. But to truly maximize their breed’s inherent interests and skills, consider activities such as field trials, competitive obedience, agility, or dock diving events.","care-training":"American Water Spaniels respond well to [reward-based training](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-obedience-training) using treats and favorite toys. Offering these items can help reduce their tendency to retrieve and play with inappropriate items.\n\nAs with all breeds, American Water Spaniels need [early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) to become well-mannered adult dogs.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/american-water-spaniel/\n\nhttp://www.fci.be/Nomenclature/Standards/301g08-en.pdf","reviewed-by":"Annette Louviere,

Water Dog","plural-name":"Portuguese Water Dogs","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The earliest written record we have of the Portuguese Water Dog is from 1297. In it, a monk recounts the story of a dog resembling the Portuguese Water Dog rescuing a drowning sailor.\n\nFlash forward to 16th-century Portugal, where Portuguese Water Dogs—or \"Porties\" to fans of the breed—served as fishermen's assistants. Excellent swimmers, Porties often delivered messages between boats, herded fish into nets, pulled in nets, and guarded boats. Consistent with the monk's story from centuries before, they also saved fishermen who fell into the water.\n\nDuring the 1800s—when commercial fishing equipment reduced the need for Portuguese Water Dogs—the breed faced extinction. But in the 1930s, a Portuguese businessman named Vasco Bensaude took an interest in the dogs and worked to save the breed.\n\nThe first pair of Porties found their way to the United States in 1958, and the breed's numbers have rebounded very well. The Portuguese Water Dog began competing in AKC shows in 1984.","facts":"The Portuguese Water Dog is an intelligent, hard-working, and energetic breed. Friendly and enthusiastic, these curly-coated cuties are equally skilled at working, playing, and lounging at home with the family.","traits-appearance":"The Portuguese Water Dog embodies strength, spirit, and soundness. Capable of working a full day in or out of the water, Porties are powerful and ruggedly built.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Portuguese Water Dog has a thick, water-repellent coat that is either curly or wavy. The coat may be white, black, or various shades of brown. A white chest blaze, white markings, and black markings are also possible. Porties frequently sport either a lion clip or retriever clip.","traits-physical":"Portuguese Water Dogs have large, well-proportioned heads and a steady, attentive expression. They have webbed feet and a rudder-like tail that help with swimming and diving.","temperament":"Portuguese Water Dogs make excellent pets for families and active individuals. They're loyal to their people and excellent with kids—though they can be exuberant. So, adult supervision is a good idea when young children are around. They're also friendly toward other pets and dogs.\n\nA very playful breed—especially around water—Porties need plenty of attention to be happy. But they reward their people with complete and utter devotion.\n\nPortuguese Water Dogs may be nervous or shy around people they don't know. The best way to help them become comfortable in a variety of situations is to [socialize them early in life](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization).","care-nutrition":"Portuguese Water Dogs require a high-quality dog food that is age-appropriate—whether it's commercially manufactured or homemade (with a veterinarian's supervision and approval).\n\nAll dogs are at risk for obesity if they eat too many calories. Monitor how much your Portuguese Water Dog eats. And avoid accidental overfeeding by measuring out meals. Also, be sure to include calories from treats when calculating their daily intake. As a general guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of a dog's calories.","care-grooming":"The Portuguese Water Dog has hair instead of fur. That means—unlike fur coats that grow to a point and then shed—a Portie's hair keeps growing and occasionally falls out, similar to human hair. But it usually falls back into the coat (instead of all over the house). Because of this minimal shedding, Portuguese Water Dogs can be an excellent breed for people with allergies.\n\nThough Porties don't shed a lot, their coats still need regular grooming. To keep their hair free from mats and tangles, brush your Portie regularly. And because the breed's hair grows continuously, they'll need haircuts every month or so.\n\nYour Portuguese Water Dog's nails will wear down through regular activity. But you should still inspect them routinely for splits or cracks and trim them as needed. Overgrown nails can be painful and could eventually lead to issues walking or running.\n\nFinally, maintaining good [dental hygiene](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) is essential for the overall long-term health of all dogs, regardless of breed. In addition to scheduling professional dental cleanings, aim to establish an at-home routine that includes regular teeth brushing.","care-exercise":"Portuguese Water Dogs are energetic, athletic dogs that need daily exercise to burn off extra energy. They excel at dog sports—such as agility, tracking, and obedience. Porties also enjoy musical freestyle, which is a mix of obedience training, dance, and tricks.\n\nBecause of their endurance, Porties make good jogging companions. And their exceptional swimming skills and love of water mean they're always up for dock diving, water trials, and fetching floating tennis balls.","care-training":"Portuguese Water Dogs often have a sensitive nature. So, they respond best to reward-based training using their favorite treats or toys.\n\nSome Porties can be independent thinkers and may try to challenge their owners. Gentle, consistent training and plenty of exercise are the best tools to curb these independent streaks.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.pwdca.org/history\n\nhttp://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/PortugueseWaterDog.pdf\n\nhttps://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/portuguese-water-dog/","reviewed-by":"Laura

Cocker Spaniel","plural-name":"American Cocker Spaniels","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"Some experts believe the ancestor of the American Cocker Spaniel—the English Cocker Spaniel—was on the Mayflower when the ship arrived in the Americas in 1620. From there, Cocker Spaniels became the constant companions of settlers, taking on prominent roles as family guards and hunters.\n\nThe American Cocker Spaniel is more petite than its ancestor, the English Cocker Spaniel. In fact, it’s the smallest dog in the entire Sporting breed group.\n\nThough American Cocker Spaniels excel as hunting dogs, they’re equally suited to life as household pets. As a result, they’ve been extremely popular in the United States for decades. So much so that classic books and movies have often portrayed the breed (e.g., “Spot” in the Dick and Jane series, “Lady” in Disney’s Lady and the Tramp).","facts":"The American Cocker Spaniel is an intelligent, happy, and playful dog. Originally bred for hunting, American Cocker Spaniels have become popular family pets—in part because of their convenient size. They’re big enough to participate in busy family life activities, yet small enough to pack up and take on outings.","traits-appearance":"American Cocker Spaniels have sturdy, compact bodies and chiseled, refined heads. Their strong backs slope slightly downward from their shoulders to their tails. The breed is well-balanced and built for both speed and endurance.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The hair on the top of the American Cocker Spaniel’s head is short and fine, while the hair on the body is medium length with enough undercoating to give them protection. Their ears, chest, stomach, and legs are well-feathered. American Cocker Spaniels are known for their silky coats, which are flat or slightly wavy.\n\nThis breed comes in solid colors with tan points or parti-color. Ticking or white markings are also possible. The underlying color varies widely. It can be black or a color ranging from pale cream to a deep red, including roan and silver.","traits-physical":"The American Cocker Spaniel’s eyes are round and full and look directly forward. They’re dark brown and appear slightly almond-shaped due to the shape of the eye rims.\n\nAmerican Cocker Spaniels have recognizable ears—long, lobular-shaped, and well-feathered. The Cocker Spaniel’s tail is set on a line with the topline of the back (or slightly higher) and wags happily when the dog is in motion.","temperament":"American Cocker Spaniels are an excellent breed for families. They’re lively, playful, devoted to their owners, and usually wonderful with children.\n\nWith a sweet disposition, American Cocker Spaniels are generally sensitive dogs. They’re equally happy participating in active family outings or cuddling on the couch with their people. As an alert and happy breed, some American Cocker Spaniels can be very energetic. So, regular exercise is always important.\n\nAmerican Cocker Spaniels are typically friendly towards other dogs and pets, provided they are [socialized with them from puppyhood](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization). And while they’re great with people they know, they may benefit from intentional socialization with strangers.","care-nutrition":"American Cocker Spaniels require high-quality food that’s appropriate for their current life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). A diet made for medium-sized dogs or one specifically formulated for American Cocker Spaniels are good options to consider.\n\nAmerican Cocker Spaniels are prone to becoming overweight. Therefore, track food portions and treats carefully to help prevent weight gain. Measuring food using a standard measuring cup will help prevent you from overfeeding. But be sure to include treat calories when calculating your dog’s daily needs. Generally speaking, treats should make up no more than 10% of their calories for the day.","care-grooming":"American Cocker Spaniels’ coats are prone to tangles and mats if not groomed regularly. Experts recommend daily brushing to keep them healthy and free of loose hair. First, use a medium comb, followed by a once-over with a slicker brush. Many American Cocker Spaniel owners use professional grooming services to keep their dog’s coat looking its best.\n\nThe American Cocker Spaniel’s long ears can make the breed more susceptible to ear infections. So, you should check and clean your dog’s ears routinely to prevent infections.\n\nWhile grooming, also take time to check your American Cocker Spaniel’s nails and trim them as needed to keep them short and tidy.\n\nDental care is an integral part of any dog’s long-term health. In addition to professional dental cleanings, be sure to establish [an at-home dental care routine](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care), including regular teeth-brushing and dental treats or toys.","care-exercise":"Bred to be active hunting dogs, American Cocker Spaniels need a lot of exercise to burn off their vast amounts of energy. Since they love spending time outdoors with their families, long walks and hikes are a great way to provide them with the regular exercise they need to thrive.\n\nAmerican Cocker Spaniels also seem to enjoy dog sports such as hunting, tracking, retrieving, agility, rally, and competitive obedience.","care-training":"American Cocker Spaniels respond well to reward-based training. Since they’re commonly quite food-motivated, you can offer treats as rewards for giving up inappropriate objects they’ve retrieved. Likewise, treats may help you manage any tendency your dog has for guarding items not intended as toys.\n\nOccasionally, American Cocker Spaniels display fearful behaviors. Reward-based training can also help to minimize these.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/cocker-spaniel/\n\nhttps://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/dog-breeds/american-cocker-spaniel\n\nhttp://www.fci.be/Nomenclature/Standards/167g08-en.pdf\n\nhttps://americanspanielclub.org\n\nhttps://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/dog-breeds/american-cocker-spaniel","reviewed-by":"Annette Louviere, DVM","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":8.6,"weight-range-pet-max":16.3,"weight-range-show-min":10.0,"weight-range-show-max":13.2,"height-range-min":36.0,"height-range-max":38.0,"life-span-range-min":10.0,"life-span-range-max":14.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":98,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":58,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":40},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b2bb6f5e-e272-5a22-8486-d45ea5950275/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b2bb6f5e-e272-5a22-8486-d45ea5950275/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b2bb6f5e-e272-5a22-8486-d45ea5950275/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b2bb6f5e-e272-5a22-8486-d45ea5950275/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b2bb6f5e-e272-5a22-8486-d45ea5950275/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b2bb6f5e-e272-5a22-8486-d45ea5950275/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b2bb6f5e-e272-5a22-8486-d45ea5950275/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b2bb6f5e-e272-5a22-8486-d45ea5950275/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b2bb6f5e-e272-5a22-8486-d45ea5950275/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b2bb6f5e-e272-5a22-8486-d45ea5950275/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b2bb6f5e-e272-5a22-8486-d45ea5950275/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b2bb6f5e-e272-5a22-8486-d45ea5950275/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b2bb6f5e-e272-5a22-8486-d45ea5950275/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b2bb6f5e-e272-5a22-8486-d45ea5950275/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b2bb6f5e-e272-5a22-8486-d45ea5950275/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b2bb6f5e-e272-5a22-8486-d45ea5950275/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b2bb6f5e-e272-5a22-8486-d45ea5950275/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b2bb6f5e-e272-5a22-8486-d45ea5950275/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"b2fa72ad-ab90-5fc5-bad5-8886e17ab5e8","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b2fa72ad-ab90-5fc5-bad5-8886e17ab5e8"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"donskoy","name":"Donskoy","plural-name":null,"published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"cat","history":"The Donskoy—also known as the Don Sphynx—originated near the Don River in Russia in 1987. There, Elena Kovaleva saw kids abusing a kitten and intervened. She brought the kitten home and named her Varvara. When Varvara started shedding her fur, Elena chalked it up to stress from her traumatic experience.\n\nTwo years later, Varvara gave birth to a litter of kittens. Some were born hairless, and the others started with hair but lost it like their mother. Taken by this unique trait, cat breeder Irina Nemikina adopted one of the kittens and used it as the foundation for a new breed: the Donskoy.\n\nOver time, breeders learned more about the Donskoy's hair loss gene. Unlike the recessive gene carried by the Sphynx, the Donskoy's gene is dominant. So, all cats with the gene either are born hairless or lose their coats as they grow.\n\nThe Donskoy breed received recognition from the World Cat Federation in 1997 and TICA in 2005.","facts":"Donskoys are intelligent, friendly cats with adorably wrinkled skin. Their social, playful nature makes them well-suited for families looking for an energetic, loyal companion.","traits-appearance":"The Donskoy is a medium-sized cat with a hard, muscular body, well-rounded belly, and wrinkled skin that's velvety to the touch.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Donskoys have four coat types: rubber bald, flocked, velour, and brush. Rubber bald cats are born without hair and remain hairless their entire lives. Flocked cats appear hairless but actually have a thin coat (which may disappear over time) with the texture of a soft chamois. Velour cats are born with a bald spot on the top of the head, and their wavy coat disappears gradually within the first year. Brush cats have bristly, soft, wavy, or wiry fur, and only a portion of their coats disappears. All types come in a variety of colors.","traits-physical":"Donskoys have several other distinguishing features. These include large, wide ears, large almond-shaped eyes, excessively elastic skin, and long, slim toes separated by webbing.","temperament":"This affectionate, good-natured breed thrives on companionship. Donskoys love to participate in all family activities and are friendly with other pets and kids. They want to be surrounded by people who genuinely enjoy interacting with them. Because they're so social, they shouldn't be left alone for long periods. If you regularly must be away for hours, consider getting your Donskoy a \"sibling\" pet for company.\n\nThese active, frisky cats enjoy playing and even make up their own games to keep themselves entertained. Donskoys also have an insatiable curiosity and are thus best for homes that offer plenty of places to explore. Interactive or puzzle toys will also keep their bodies and minds busy.","care-nutrition":"Donskoys require a high-quality diet. Because nutritional needs vary for kittens, adults, and senior cats, opt for a formula that's age-appropriate for your pet.\n\nAll cats are at risk of obesity, especially as they age and their activity levels decline. To help your Donskoy maintain a healthy weight, measure out meals and reduce portions if necessary. And don't forget to account for treats. As a guideline, they should make up no more than 10% of a cat's calories.\n\nLastly, all cats need access to fresh, clean water around the clock.","care-grooming":"Hairless Donskoys don't require brushing, but they do need grooming to remove excess oil from their skin. Wiping them down daily with a wet towel and bathing them every week or two does the trick. Be sure to pay special attention to their nail beds, nose, and ears, as these places tend to collect debris. To protect your Donskoy from sunburn, use a veterinarian-approved sunscreen whenever they're outdoors.\n\nMost cats' nails require monthly trimming to prevent them from getting too long. Long nails are more likely to snag on something and become torn or damaged. They can even grow into your cat's paw pads, leading to pain or infection. In addition to clipping, providing a scratching post will allow your cat to do some nail maintenance themselves (thanks to their instinct to scratch).\n\nGood dental hygiene is essential to a Donskoy's overall health.

Of all the subtypes, the Hequ is most closely related to the aboriginal Tibetan Mastiff. As the name suggests, this breed originated in an area of Tibet called Hequ—near the junction point of the Qinghai, Gansu, and Sichuan provinces.\n\nHequ Tibetan Mastiffs remained isolated in the Himalayan Mountains for thousands of years, evolving naturally in their environment. They worked alongside nomadic livestock farmers guarding tents and providing protection from wolves, snow leopards, and other predators.\n\nAs a result of their isolation, the Hequ—like Tibetan Mastiffs in general—is a rare breed.","facts":"Strong and protective, Hequ Tibetan Mastiffs have served as devoted guard dogs in the mountains of Tibet for centuries.","traits-appearance":"Hequ Tibetan Mastiffs are large dogs with strong, balanced, fine-boned bodies.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Hequ's thick double coat can be long or short. Short, soft hair covers the head and ears, and longer hair forms a mane around the shoulders. These dogs typically come in black and golden or black and tan. On black and tan dogs, the tan markings are usually very light. So, the coat is often described as black with silver markings.","traits-physical":"This breed has a broad head with a substantial back skull, deep-set, almond-shaped eyes, and a full, square muzzle. Compared to other Tibetan Mastiffs, the Hequ has smaller ears. Their tails are well-feathered and curl over their backs.","temperament":"Hequ Tibetan Mastiffs are fiercely protective of their families but often wary of strangers. They can also be independent, strong-willed, and territorial. Because they tend to bark, they're a better fit for rural life (where they won't annoy nearby neighbors).\n\nThough these pups are devoted to their owners, they're not always overly affectionate. They may also be possessive of food or toys. So, [early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) and proper introductions to other animals, children, and unfamiliar guests are essential.","care-nutrition":"These dogs thrive on a high-quality diet formulated for their life stage and large size. Large breed puppy foods help prevent them from growing too fast—which is important for the proper development of strong, healthy bones and joints. This may also decrease the likelihood or severity of several developmental bone and joint (orthopedic) diseases common in large breed dogs, such as hip and elbow dysplasia.\n\nIn spite of their great size, Hequ Tibetan Mastiffs don't have big appetites. Still, it's wise to keep an eye on their food intake and limit treats to no more than 10% of their daily calories.","care-grooming":"During seasonal shedding periods, Hequ Tibetan Mastiffs require almost daily grooming with a de-shedding tool to remove the undercoat. But the rest of the year, a weekly brushing to remove dirt, debris, and tangles is sufficient.\n\nTo reduce your pup's chance of ear infections, check their ears regularly and clean them as needed to remove wax build-up and debris. And be sure to trim those nails to prevent them from snagging on things and breaking.\n\nLastly, good [dental hygiene](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) will support your dog's overall health. So, in addition to professional cleanings, establish an at-home dental care program that includes regular teeth brushing and veterinarian-recommended dental chews.","care-exercise":"This breed requires moderate exercise to stay happy and healthy. And they prefer slow-paced, leashed walks to games of fetch or chase. Better yet, set your pup loose to roam in a large, enclosed area.","care-training":"Hequ Tibetan Mastiffs are intelligent dogs and quick learners. But they tend to get bored during training sessions and aren't overly motivated by treats or praise. Try to keep training sessions short and engaging so they don't lose interest.\n\nEven when well-trained, these independent pups may not always come when called. As such, it's best to keep them on a leash when they're in unsecured areas.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.tibetanmastiff.org/brief-history.html\n\nhttps://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/tibetan-mastiff/\n\nhttps://www.mastinotibetano.org/blog/varieta-locali-del-mastino-tibetano-tipo-hequ/\n\nhttps://hhehmzdl3v4ghhtpkzsxfjgi5e-ac4c6men2g7xr2a-baike-baidu-com","reviewed-by":"Laura

Coyote’s name is derived from the Aztec ‘coyotl,’ which dates back at least a thousand years. As Anglo-Americans started arriving in the Southwest from 1820-1840, they encountered an animal that the native people referred to as coyote.\n\nCoyotes and humans have always had a storied past—in part due to the Coyote’s intelligence and predatory nature with human domestic or game animals—and it hasn’t always been one that ended well for the Coyote. In fact, between 1947 and 1956, approximately 6.5 million coyotes were exterminated in the western United States through federal management programs.\n\nThe Coyote’s range now reaches across Canada and the United States, even within urban settings. Because of their adaptability, Coyote populations in North America are stronger than they’ve ever been.","facts":"The Coyote—also known as the prairie or brush wolf—is closely related to dogs and has a dog-like appearance. Despite this similarity, Coyotes are still wild animals and should not be brought home or kept as pets. Though some people do have licenses to specifically house Coyotes, it’s best to remember that they are not domesticated and while rare, Coyotes have been known to attack.","traits-appearance":"The exact size of a Coyote varies depending on where exactly it lives and what time of year it is.\n\nWhen prey is hard to find, for example, these animals primarily become vegetarian, which makes them much less muscular than they tend to be when they are hunting for meat. As with their size, Coyotes’ coats may look different depending on their habitat.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Coyotes have long, coarse fur that is traditionally reddish on the legs and a mix of gray and red elsewhere, with a bushy, black-tipped tail.","traits-physical":"There is not much that’s distinct about a Coyote’s appearance. In fact, in the wild, it can be difficult to discern a Coyote from a medium or large dog from a distance. These animals vary greatly in color or size depending on where in the world they live.","temperament":"The Coyote is an intelligent, cunning and adaptable animal. They are incredibly fast and efficient hunters, and they are mostly nocturnal, doing the majority of their hunting in the dark at night.\n\nThe Coyote has plenty of competition when it comes to food sources—including lynx and bobcats—and larger animals, like wolves, do sometimes prey on coyotes themselves.\n\nCoyotes are incredibly territorial and can live 13 to 15 years in captivity. In the wild, however, these animals tend to live between six and eight years.\n\nThe Coyote is primarily nocturnal, and their nightly yaps and yowls can be heard by those close enough when they find prey.\n\nThey are efficient, intelligent hunters with keen senses, and while they tend to be afraid of humans, there have been stories of meetings gone wrong.

That might explain why we have so many varieties of Pointers today—including short-haired, wire-haired, and silky-coated. But one thing is sure: Pointers make versatile gundogs that can point, flush, and retrieve from land or water.\n\nPointers and [Greyhounds](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/greyhound) used to work together to form a hunting dream team. The Pointers would find and point to hares for the speedy Greyhounds to chase down and catch.\n\nThe breed came to America in the late 1800s and quickly became popular hunting companions and, eventually, affectionate family pets. The Pointer was one of the first nine breeds registered in the United States in 1878. It received American Kennel Club recognition in 1884.","facts":"The Pointer is a noble, intelligent, and energetic breed. These dogs (literally) made a name for themselves with their pointing skills. But today, they make loyal family pets as well as hard-working hunting companions.","traits-appearance":"The Pointer has an alert, intelligent expression and a muscular body that gives the impression of compact power and agile grace.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Pointer's lustrous coat is short, dense, and smooth. It may be solid black, liver, lemon, or orange—or any of these colors combined with white. The breed's nose is black or brown in darker colored dogs. But it can be flesh-colored in dogs with lighter coats. Ticking may be visible in some dogs.","traits-physical":"The Pointer's ears reach just below the lower jaw and hang close to the head. The round, intense eyes are usually dark, contrasting with the markings on the coat. The tail is thick at the root and tapers to a point at the tip.\n\nThough Pointers have these specific traits, all dogs display physical characteristics passed down through their DNA.","temperament":"Pointers are ideal family pets because of their alert, loyal, and affectionate personalities. This breed does well in active households with plenty of room to run and play. And you'll get bonus points for a sunny yard because Pointers prefer to live in warm climates.\n\nThis breed needs plenty of human companionship to be happy. Pointers want nothing more than to participate in activities with their people. They're also protective and patient with kids.\n\nThough most are known for being calm, even-tempered pets, some Pointers may have a lot of nervous energy. And the breed can sometimes be reserved with strangers.","care-nutrition":"Pointers need high-quality food that's appropriate for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). They also benefit from diets formulated for large-breed dogs. It keeps them from growing too fast, which may decrease the incidence or severity of hip dysplasia as they age.\n\nPointers are more prone than other breeds to bloat (also known as twisted stomach). To help prevent bloat, break your dog's food up into several meals a day, and use a food bowl designed to slow their rate of eating. Also, avoid feeding your Pointer immediately before or after any kind of vigorous activity. These are just a few ways you can help prevent this life-threatening condition. Consult your veterinarian about other methods, including surgical options, for preventing bloat.\n\nAll dogs are at risk for obesity if they eat too many calories. Avoid accidental overfeeding by measuring out their meals. And be sure to include calories from treats when calculating their daily intake. As a general guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of a dog's calories.","care-grooming":"Pointers have relatively low-maintenance coats. Weekly brushing with a soft-bristle brush or a hound glove is typically enough to remove loose hair and keep your pup's coat looking clean and glossy.\n\nIt's important to trim your Pointer's nails regularly. Overgrown nails can be painful and could eventually lead to issues walking or running.\n\nAnd finally, maintaining good [dental hygiene](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) is essential for any dog's long-term health. In addition to scheduling professional dental cleanings, aim to establish an at-home routine that includes regular teeth brushing.","care-exercise":"Bred to work, Pointers are energetic dogs. As such, they need regular exercise and mental stimulation to be happy. Field trials, agility, tracking, and obedience events can help them exercise their bodies and minds at the same time (while bonding with their owners).\n\nThese high-endurance dogs also make great running buddies and hiking companions. And they're always game for a good romp in the backyard with their favorite human.","care-training":"The Pointer's intelligence and even-temperament make it a relatively easy breed to train. These dogs respond well to gentle, reward-based training using their favorite treats or toys.\n\n[Socializing your Pointer early](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) will help them develop into a well-mannered adult dog. This is especially important if you have other pets at home.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/pointer/\n\nhttp://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/Pointer.pdf","reviewed-by":"Annette Louviere, DVM","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":20.0,"weight-range-pet-max":37.2,"weight-range-show-min":20.0,"weight-range-show-max":34.0,"height-range-min":61.0,"height-range-max":69.0,"life-span-range-min":12.0,"life-span-range-max":17.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":101,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":65,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":43},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b4faa8f0-ecce-5775-b037-83b51af506d5/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b4faa8f0-ecce-5775-b037-83b51af506d5/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b4faa8f0-ecce-5775-b037-83b51af506d5/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b4faa8f0-ecce-5775-b037-83b51af506d5/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b4faa8f0-ecce-5775-b037-83b51af506d5/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b4faa8f0-ecce-5775-b037-83b51af506d5/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b4faa8f0-ecce-5775-b037-83b51af506d5/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b4faa8f0-ecce-5775-b037-83b51af506d5/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b4faa8f0-ecce-5775-b037-83b51af506d5/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b4faa8f0-ecce-5775-b037-83b51af506d5/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b4faa8f0-ecce-5775-b037-83b51af506d5/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b4faa8f0-ecce-5775-b037-83b51af506d5/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b4faa8f0-ecce-5775-b037-83b51af506d5/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b4faa8f0-ecce-5775-b037-83b51af506d5/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b4faa8f0-ecce-5775-b037-83b51af506d5/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b4faa8f0-ecce-5775-b037-83b51af506d5/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b4faa8f0-ecce-5775-b037-83b51af506d5/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b4faa8f0-ecce-5775-b037-83b51af506d5/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"b5f049df-54c5-5219-96df-b8bca366b75c","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b5f049df-54c5-5219-96df-b8bca366b75c"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"african-wildcat-felis-lybica","name":"African Wildcat","plural-name":null,"published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"cat","history":"The African Wildcat, also known as the Egyptian Wildcat, resides throughout most parts of Africa, southwest and central Asia, India, China, and Mongolia.

As civilizations developed, cats became helpful partners in pest control. But before selective breeding began in the 19th century, cats were—and mostly still are—non-pedigreed.\n\nUnlike pet cats, Kenyan street cats live with little human contact. Feral cats—known as khadzonzo—that roam the coastal region of Kenya formed the foundation of the Sokoke breed in the 1970s. Khadzonzo typically have lean bodies, long, tapered tails, and mottled coat patterns.\n\nLack of neutering, financial constraints, and attitudes about cats, in general, all contribute to an overpopulation of Kenyan street cats.","facts":"Kenyan street cats are free-roaming felines that reside in forested areas and city streets. They share many physical characteristics with pet cats, but they've genetically adapted to their local environment and lead a mostly independent life outdoors.","traits-appearance":"Kenyan street cats come in different shapes and sizes. However, they often have a long, lean appearance that resembles Asian domestic cats.\n\nSigns of a life-long street cat—versus a stray cat who may be lost—include a clean, well-kept coat (thanks to their meticulous self-grooming), protective body language, and lack of eye contact. Because they're intact, male street cats may have thick necks, muscular bodies, and scars from fighting.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Though all colors and patterns are possible, Kenyan street cats often have short, coarse, tabby coats that come in shades of brown with prominent ticking and mottling.","traits-physical":"Kenyan street cats do not follow a breed standard. Their combination of features can vary. But they often have narrow faces, long ears, lean bodies, long legs, and tapered tails.","temperament":"Street cats often live in groups and congregate near food sources and shelter. Though they may live near people, they are not usually accustomed to human contact. Some are fearful of being handled or confined. Others may adapt to interactions with people and learn to live indoors.","care-nutrition":"A Kenyan street cat's diet typically consists of whatever they can find—scraps from trash cans, birds and rodents, handouts from kind strangers, and so on. If you're leaving food out for a street cat, they will benefit from the same commercially prepared diets as pet cats.","care-grooming":"Street Cats are typically fastidious groomers that keep their coats relatively clean. If you've taken in a street cat that will tolerate it, regular brushing and nail trims will help keep them in tip-top shape.","care-exercise":null,"care-training":null,"care-health":"Kenyan Street cats are susceptible to the same diseases as pet cats—including rabies, distemper, feline immunodeficiency virus, and feline leukemia.

supposed descendent of a dog found by U.S. troops during World War II, the Kromfohrlander originated in Germany in the 1940s. The breed's name comes from the Krom Fohr area of Siegerland in Western Germany.\n\nThe Kromfohrlander likely arose from the crossing of a fox terrier and Griffon-type breed, which yielded two varieties of the same breed—one smooth-haired and the other wire-haired. The Kromfohrlander remains an exceptionally rare dog to this day.","facts":"Kromfohrlanders are intelligent and spirited dogs that make excellent companions and enjoyable pets. Always cheerful and affectionate, they're devoted to their families and like to stay close to home.","traits-appearance":"The wire-haired Kromfohrlander sports a distinctive beard and resembles its terrier roots. The smooth-haired variety is similar in appearance to a Spaniel.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The wire-haired (Rauhaar) and smooth-haired (Glatthaar) coats on the Kromfohrlander are both medium-length. However, the smooth-haired variety tends to feature a longer coat overall. The standard coat for this breed features brown, tan, or \"buff\" markings on white, with a symmetrical blaze on the face.","traits-physical":"A white blaze centered between the eyes of the Kromfohrlander is one of this breed's distinguishing characteristics.","temperament":"Kromfohrlanders are lively, good-natured, and intelligent dogs. Unlike some breeds in the terrier group, they have a low hunting drive. They are very adaptable and rarely stray from their owners.\n\nThis breed is pleasant, loyal, and enjoys hanging out at home with the family. Though they can be initially hesitant around strangers and children, these playful dogs make for lifelong friends once they warm up to people. The Kromfohrlander also makes a good watch dog and—like its terrier cousins—an all-star rat catcher.\n\nAs puppies, Kromfohrlanders need [proper training and socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization), or they will test the limits of their owners.","care-nutrition":"Kromfohrlanders can be finicky about what they eat. For this reason, they require high-quality food to maintain their weight and energy level. Though it's always important to keep an eye on how much food you're feeding your dog, it's unlikely you'll have to worry about this breed overeating.","care-grooming":"This breed typically sheds twice a year. You'll need to vacuum or sweep regularly to clean up fallen hair. But otherwise, these are clean, low-maintenance dogs with little or no smell.","care-exercise":"Kromfohrlanders would happily rest at the side of their people all day. However, regular outdoor exercise is important. This sporty and athletic breed loves to play and run.\n\nOnce Kromfohrlanders hit age three and their joints have developed, they can jump in the air for a frisbee. But a long walk in the woods seems to be their favorite pastime.\n\nIt's important to note that the Kromfohrlanders don't typically do well at a dog park. They prefer dogs they already know over those they don't—and the same is true about unfamiliar people and situations.","care-training":"Though a little independent, Kromfohrlanders are easy to train. They have a strong ability to focus and maintain attention. As a result, they can learn many tricks and will happily engage in long training sessions.\n\nAs intuitive, eager learners, Kromfohrlanders thrive with positive reinforcement.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/kromfohrlander/\n\nhttp://www.kromiclub.com/faq.html\n\nhttps://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Dog_Encyclopedia/ZWLyAAAAQBAJ","reviewed-by":"Cindy

Romagnolo","plural-name":"Lagotti Romagnolo","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"Many experts think the Lagotto Romagnolo (Lagotti Romagnoli, when pluralized) is the founding breed of all water dogs. Images of dogs resembling this ancient Italian breed existed in the necropolis of the Etruscan city Spina. But written evidence of the Lagotto Romagnolo didn't appear until the 1600s.\n\nLagotto Romagnolo means \"lake dog from Romagna,\" and refers to the breed's original job retrieving waterfowl from the marshes of Italy. However, the drainage of marshlands and decline in waterfowl populations in the 1800s left the Lagotto Romagnolo in need of a new job.\n\nFortunately, the breed's keen sense of smell and natural searching skills made it a great candidate for truffle hunting in the Romagna countryside. Today, the Lagotto Romagnolo is the only breed in the world recognized as a specialized truffle dog.\n\nFirst recorded in the Foundation Stock Service in 2001, the Lagotto Romagnolo became part of the sporting group in 2015.","facts":"The Lagotto Romagnolo is a lively, agile, adaptable breed known for its sense of humor. Though durable and hardworking, these dogs come in cute, curly-coated packages. As if that's not enough, the Lagotto Romagnolo is also considered the world's finest truffle dog.","traits-appearance":"The Lagotto Romagnolo is a well-proportioned, powerfully built breed with a rustic appearance and dense, curly coat.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Lagotto Romagnolo's tight, ring-shaped curls have a wooly, semi-rough texture. The topcoat and undercoat combine to repel water.\n\nThe breed comes in various shades of brown (with or without white), orange (with or without white), off-white, white with brown or orange patches, and brown roan. Some Lagotti Romagnoli have brown to dark brown masks, and some may have tan markings.\n\nAs this breed ages, the coat color tends to fade. A coat that starts off brown can end up as a silver/grey roan coloration.","traits-physical":"The Lagotto Romagnolo has a broad head and square, compact body. Ranging from ochre to hazel to dark brown, the dog's eyes are large and rounded. The ears are medium-sized and triangular with rounded tips.","temperament":"The Lagotto Romagnolo is a lively, affectionate, adaptable breed that wants nothing more than to be part of everyday family life.\n\nLagotti Romagnoli bond strongly with their families and get along well with kids and other pets. Since they always want to be in on the action, they don't do well when left alone or excluded from family activities. They are devoted housemates with good guarding instincts.\n\nThough they are very social, Lagotti Romagnoli do tend to be shy. [Early socializing](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) can help them overcome this shyness so they may grow into well-adjusted adult dogs.","care-nutrition":"Lagotti Romagnoli need a high-quality diet that's appropriate for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior) and activity level. To prevent them from becoming overweight, keep a close eye on their food portions. And be sure to take treats into account when tracking their daily calorie intake. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of a dog's calories.","care-grooming":"Because their coats are hair and not fur, Lagotti Romagnoli make excellent pets for people with allergies. Plus, minimal shedding means they only need to be brushed once every 1-2 weeks. However, Lagotti Romagnoli do need regular haircuts, ideally from a professional groomer.\n\nAll dogs' nails wear down during daily activity. But they still require regular inspection and occasional trimming to prevent pain and other problems caused by overly long nails.\n\nMaintaining good [dental hygiene](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) is also important for the overall long-term health of your Lagotto Romagnolo. In addition to professional cleanings, aim to establish an at-home dental care routine that includes teeth brushing and dental chews or treats.","care-exercise":"Active but not hyper, Lagotti Romagnoli need daily exercise—preferably alongside their favorite humans. Long walks, family hikes, and play sessions in the backyard are great activities for this fun-loving breed. And because they're naturals in the water, most Lagotti Romagnoli love to swim.\n\nBred to be working dogs, Lagotti Romagnoli need to work out both their minds and their bodies. Dog sports—such as rally, agility, tracking, obedience, and nose work—are an entertaining way to satisfy this need.","care-training":"The Lagotto Romagnolo is a highly intelligent breed that's relatively easy to train. These dogs love to work and are eager to please. So, they get the most out of a regular, consistent training program.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/lifestyle/5-facts-lagotto-romagnolo/\n\nhttps://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/LagottoRomagnolo.pdf\n\nhttps://www.lagottous.com/page-18071","reviewed-by":"Annette

Shepherd Dog","plural-name":"Bohemian Shepherd Dogs","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"Also known as the Chodský Pes, the Bohemian Shepherd dates back to 1325. That's when the King of Bohemia—concerned about German expansion—tapped the Chodové people to guard the border between Bohemia and Bavaria. And he allowed them to breed dogs to help patrol the area. In addition to their role as guard dogs, the resulting Bohemian Shepherds worked as herding dogs and farm helpers.\n\nTwo world wars depleted the pool of these hard-working dogs, as it did for many breeds. They may have disappeared entirely if not for the dedication of Dr. Vilem Kurz and Jan Findejs. In the mid-1980s, the duo created a breed standard and breeding program for the Bohemian Shepherd and restored the breed. The first litter from their program was born in 1985.\n\nIn 2019, the FCI provisionally recognized the breed. That same year, the AKC accepted the Bohemian Shepherd into the Foundation Stock Service.","facts":"The Bohemian Shepherd is a lively, intelligent, versatile breed. These athletic pups make excellent watchdogs, enthusiastic sidekicks, and devoted family pets.","traits-appearance":"The Bohemian Shepherd is a medium-sized sheepdog with a compact, graceful appearance.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"This breed's coat is long and glossy with a coarse texture. It can be straight or slightly wavy and has a shorter undercoat. Bohemian Shepherds' long hair covers their earlobes and forms brushes at the base. Their tails have thick fur with wavy fringes on the underside.\n\nBohemians come in black to gunmetal black with rich tan markings on the ears, face, throat, legs, feet, and tail.","traits-physical":"Bohemian Shepherds have short, erect, triangular ears and medium-sized, almond-shaped brown eyes. Their necks are long and graceful, and their backs firm and straight. They're known for their noble appearance and energetic, pleasing expression.","temperament":"Lively, fearless dogs, Bohemians are devoted to their people and love a good adventure. Their athleticism and eagerness to be involved in activities make them a good fit for active households.\n\nThese pups are typically calm and not overly demanding. They get along well with children and make loving family members and excellent watchdogs. Their stable, friendly personalities also make them well-suited for work as emotional support animals.\n\nBohemians are built to withstand cold weather, but they can overheat in the summer. So, they're happiest spending hot afternoons indoors lying on a cool floor near their humans.","care-nutrition":"Bohemian Shepherds thrive on a high-quality diet formulated for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). Since obesity is on the rise in dogs, it's important to keep an eye on their food intake. Measuring their portions will help prevent overfeeding and keep them at a healthy weight. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of your dog's daily calories.","care-grooming":"Weekly brushing will keep your Bohemian's coat in tip-top shape. During periods of seasonal shedding, you may need to brush more frequently. Regular nail trims should also be part of their grooming routine—as overgrown nails can cause pain and potentially lead to problems running or walking.\n\nDental disease is one of the most common conditions in adult dogs and, left untreated, can contribute to other serious health issues. Professional cleanings combined with regular at-home teeth brushing will help keep your pup's teeth and gums healthy (and their breath fresh).","care-exercise":"Bohemian Shepherds originated as working dogs, and they like to keep busy. Daily walks, hikes, and play sessions are all good ways for them to stay in shape. Due to their athletic nature, they also excel at dog sports—such as agility, dock diving, and competitive obedience.

And she wasn't alone. The dog captured the attention and affection of onlookers in her hometown of Wasilla, Alaska. Spurlin set out to create more dogs like it by breeding Alaskan Huskies with small Nordic breeds, such as the [Schipperke](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/schipperke) and [American Eskimo Dog](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/breed-library/american-eskimo-dog).\n\nSpurlin eventually developed a strict breed standard and began selling Klee Kai puppies to the public in 1987. Less than a decade later, the name was changed to Alaskan Klee Kai to honor their origins.\n\nThe AKC doesn't recognize the Alaskan Klee Kai. But many other organizations—including the Federation of International Canines, the American Rare Breed Association, and the United Kennel Club—do. The Alaskan Klee Kai Association of America also helps maintain breed standards.","facts":"The Alaskan Klee Kai is a relatively new breed, named after the Inuit term for \"little dog.\" Though not as big as their sled dog ancestors, Alaskan Klee Kai are active dogs that love to be on the go. And they excel at activities such as (miniature) carting.","traits-appearance":"Alaskan Klee Kai come in three sizes: toy, miniature, and standard. All are under 17 inches tall and weigh between 5–22 pounds. Like the Alaskan Husky, this breed has a thick, fluffy coat, curly tail, pricked ears, and striking coloring on its face.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Alaskan Klee Kai has a double coat that can be shades of black, grey, and red. A solid coat color (including white) that doesn't have distinct markings does not meet the breed standard.","traits-physical":"The Klee Kai has distinctive dark and light coloring on its face. This so-called \"face mask\" is similar to the markings on Alaskan Huskies and resembles goggles.","temperament":"The Alaskan Klee Kai is curious, active, intelligent, and agile. Though small in size, they have big personalities. They will often sound the alarm—with a cute \"woo woo\" bark—to guard their territories. Their tendency to be on high alert combined with their sense of loyalty makes the Alaskan Klee Kai an excellent guard dog. However, because they're so vocal, they're generally not a good fit for apartment living.\n\nKlee Kais are affectionate dogs that are great for active families, but they can be standoffish with strangers. They get along well with other dogs but aren't well-suited for homes with smaller pets due to their strong prey drive.","care-nutrition":"Alaskan Klee Kai require a high-quality dog food appropriate for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). Because of their size and energy level, they also benefit from a diet specially formulated for active, small-breed dogs.\n\nThe breed's energetic nature minimizes the risk of obesity. But it's still important to monitor their food intake. Excess weight puts the Klee Kai at higher risk for health issues. So, use a measuring cup to portion out their food to avoid overfeeding. And make sure treats make up no more than 10% of their daily calories.","care-grooming":"Because of their double coat, the Alaskan Klee Kai sheds quite a bit. However, weekly brushings are typically enough to remove excess hair. These dogs blow their coats twice a year. During such seasonal shedding periods, a bath will remove some of the excess hair. Regular nail trims and ear cleanings are also easy ways to keep your pup healthy and looking good.\n\nAlaskan Klee Kai, like other dogs, require regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) that includes at-home teeth brushing and annual professional dental cleanings. Start a dental care program early and maintain it throughout your pup's life. Good dental hygiene is essential for their overall long-term health.","care-exercise":"Klee Kais are active and like to be on the go. Because of their strong hunting instincts and prey drive, they can be unreliable off-leash. Play sessions in a secure, fenced yard and regular leashed walks are a few of the best ways to keep these high-energy dogs happy.\n\nWithout sufficient exercise, the Alaskan Klee Kai could become high-strung and anxious. Activities like agility and [obedience training](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-obedience-training) are a great fit for these quick, intelligent dogs.","care-training":"The Alaskan Klee Kai is an intelligent breed that's easy to train. Use positive reinforcement and treats to mold their behavior. Because of their curious nature, it's important to change up training activities for your Klee Kai (so they don't get bored).\n\nThis breed tends to be aloof with strangers. [Socializing your dog from puppyhood](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) is critical for making them more comfortable around unfamiliar faces.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/canine-partners/husky-lite-meet-alaskan-klee-kai/\n\nhttps://www.akkaoa.org/how-it-started\n\nhttps://www.ukcdogs.com/alaskan-klee-kai\n\nhttps://www.petfinder.com/dog-breeds/alaskan-klee-kai/","reviewed-by":"Cindy Elston, DVM, MPH","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":5.4,"weight-range-pet-max":10.9,"weight-range-show-min":4.5,"weight-range-show-max":10.4,"height-range-min":33.0,"height-range-max":43.0,"life-span-range-min":12.0,"life-span-range-max":16.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":90,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":56,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":42},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b79a4e2f-e93a-5089-994e-4aafafc2311a/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b79a4e2f-e93a-5089-994e-4aafafc2311a/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b79a4e2f-e93a-5089-994e-4aafafc2311a/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b79a4e2f-e93a-5089-994e-4aafafc2311a/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b79a4e2f-e93a-5089-994e-4aafafc2311a/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b79a4e2f-e93a-5089-994e-4aafafc2311a/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b79a4e2f-e93a-5089-994e-4aafafc2311a/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b79a4e2f-e93a-5089-994e-4aafafc2311a/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b79a4e2f-e93a-5089-994e-4aafafc2311a/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b79a4e2f-e93a-5089-994e-4aafafc2311a/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b79a4e2f-e93a-5089-994e-4aafafc2311a/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b79a4e2f-e93a-5089-994e-4aafafc2311a/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b79a4e2f-e93a-5089-994e-4aafafc2311a/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b79a4e2f-e93a-5089-994e-4aafafc2311a/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b79a4e2f-e93a-5089-994e-4aafafc2311a/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b79a4e2f-e93a-5089-994e-4aafafc2311a/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b79a4e2f-e93a-5089-994e-4aafafc2311a/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b79a4e2f-e93a-5089-994e-4aafafc2311a/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"b7c06b8d-b089-547c-adda-f9d19119b49d","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b7c06b8d-b089-547c-adda-f9d19119b49d"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"gray-wolf","name":"Wolf","plural-name":"Wolves","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The wolves began as an animal that once had the largest distribution of any land mammal outside of humans and lions—roaming from Alaska and Arctic Canada south towards central Mexico, and through Europe and Asia—living in every type of habitat except the driest deserts and most tropical forests.\n\nIn North America, specifically, the wolves’ luck began to change shortly after European settlers arrived. Fear of the wolf, and its predation on domestic animals, led it nearly to extinction in the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nDespite the U.S. federal government’s plan to systematically poison the country’s wolf population, the Endangered Species Act now protects wolves.\n\nThis protection—and their quick reproductive cycles—has helped the wolf population rebound. In fact, a large-scale conservation effort to reintroduce wolves to Yellowstone National Park has been underway since 1995 and has been highly successful at restoring the population there.","facts":"Did you know that wolves are technically members of the dog family? Though wild wolves have been, and continue to be studied by experts, much about these dog-like animals is relatively unknown to humans. In the wild, wolves are nomadic, traveling miles in pursuit of food. Wolves are social animals, living and hunting in packs with a strict hierarchy. Despite the relation—and similarity in appearance—to (some) domestic dogs, wild wolves should never be domesticated.","traits-appearance":"There are many different species of wolves, leading to a diversity in size. Some wolves, like the gray or timber wolf, can be more than six feet long and weigh as much as 175 pounds! Wolves are very similar in appearance to some domestic dog breeds, although wolves will differ in general appearance depending on their species.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Different species of wolves will have different coat types and coloring. The most common type of wolf—the gray or timber wolf—usually has thick gray fur, but all black and all white varieties also exist.","traits-physical":"One of the most common types of wolf, the gray or timber wolf can grow much larger than their dog counterparts. Other than their size, the iconic wolf howl is another feature that sets this animal apart from the dog.","temperament":"Wolves are nomadic pack animals that tend to travel in groups of six to ten wolves, working together in a hierarchy.\n\nThey are steadfast hunters, traveling up to 12 miles in one day, and while they rarely attack humans, humans and wolves continue to have a cantankerous relationship likely due in part to the wolves’ instinct to prey on domestic animals.\n\nTheir behaviors are very similar to that of dogs—they enjoy playing amongst each other and chewing—but they are territorial and they will growl when they feel encroached upon.","care-nutrition":"Wolves are carnivores, and they have quite an appetite. In fact, the larger of these animals (such as a gray or timber wolf weighing in at 175 pounds) eat up to 20 pounds of food in one meal.\n\nSmaller wolves—like red wolves—eat tinier prey like rodents and rabbits.","care-grooming":"Wolves in the wild are surprisingly tidy animals that spend a lot of time keeping themselves clean. They will give themselves baths in nearby water sources, and pack members will even help groom each other through a series of behaviors like licking each other's coats and removing debris with their teeth.","care-exercise":"Wolves are skilled hunters and nomadic animals, traveling up to 12 miles a day in pursuit of food. They enjoy stimulating activities similar to a domestic dog, as well, like playing within their packs.","care-training":"Wolves are wild animals that should not be brought home for domestication.

The breed started its journey in Trout, Louisiana, in 1972, when a normal-coated litter of Rat Terriers included a hairless puppy.\n\nA couple received the hairless puppy as a gift, and that puppy—whom they named Josephine—created the American Hairless Terrier line. Josephine eventually produced a new set of hairless siblings who, when bred together, gave birth to several hairless puppies to create the breed.The first American Hairless Terrier club formed in 2009 and the breed gained American Kennel Club recognition in 2016.","facts":"As the name implies, American Hairless Terriers are, in fact, usually hairless—though there is a second variety that does have a short coat.\n\nThis breed makes a great addition to most families, especially since they usually get along with kids and other dogs, as well.","traits-appearance":"This small dog comes in both a hairless and coated version, although the hairless version may have whiskers and eyebrows. The hairless American Hairless Terrier has smooth skin, while the coated version — sometimes referred to as ‘Coated Carriers’ — have short coats.

The hairless version may have eyebrows or whiskers, but their skin is smooth and hairless all over. This version is born with a soft “birth coat,” which should fall off over time.

In the hairless form, the American Hairless Terrier is born with a soft down that falls off completely around eight to 10 weeks of age.","temperament":"The American Hairless Terrier is a lively, intelligent dog that loves hanging out with its people and gets along well with other dogs. This small dog is adaptable and easy to care for, plus they tend to be easy to train. The breed is alert and may bark at strangers.","care-nutrition":"The American Hairless Terrier is an active breed that does best with high-quality dog food that’s suited to their particular age, as well as any additional health concerns.\n\nAs with any dog, it’s important to monitor the amount of food and treats that you give your American Hairless Terrier, especially since some dogs may be prone to gaining weight as they age. Your veterinarian is always a good source to help provide you with appropriate nutrition and feeding guidelines.","care-grooming":"The American Hairless Terrier can come in one of two varieties: hairless or coated. Grooming for the hairless variety is minimal, since they don’t have a coat to brush, but you will want to pay special attention to sun protection to avoid having the dog burn.\n\nMeanwhile, coated variety comes with a short coat that barely sheds, so a once-weekly brush should do the trick.\n\nAll dogs require regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care), including at-home teeth brushing and professional dental cleanings, and the American Hairless Terrier is no exception.

Roman cattle dogs traveled alongside Roman troops, herding the cattle that the soldiers used for food. They made their way through Europe and Germany and eventually stopped in the town of Rottweil. Rottweil became a cattle area, and the descendants of the Roman cattle dogs—now known as Rottweilers—protected the herds.\n\nRottweilers made excellent working dogs. They pulled carts, herded and protected cattle, and hunted boar. But by the end of the 19th century, the breed was virtually extinct—only one female remained in the entire town of Rottweil. Luckily, a Rottweiler club was founded in Germany in 1907, and the breed survived.\n\nWhen there was a need for police dogs before World War I, Rottweilers were picked for the job. They were ideally suited for the work thanks to their strength, intelligence, and ability to follow directions.\n\nThe American Kennel Club officially recognized Rottweilers—affectionately called \"Rotties\"—in 1931.","facts":"The Rottweiler is a very intelligent breed that's trustworthy, strong, and loyal to its family. Rottweilers can be protective of their people and territory but are usually calm when they don't feel threatened. They make excellent watchdogs and loving companions.","traits-appearance":"Medium-large in size, the Rottweiler has a reputation for being a hearty, strong, working dog. The breed has an excessively stocky look, with a broad chest, long back, and thick legs.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The short-haired coat of the Rottweiler is always black and accompanied by shades of tan, ranging from bright rust to dark mahogany. Rottweilers have a spot above each eye and on the sides of the muzzle. Their legs may also be marked.","traits-physical":"Rottweilers have large, boxy heads, almond-shaped eyes, and powerful, thick necks. The breed's heavily muscled hind legs support its solid body. Their paws are large and heavy, and their ears fold down to a triangular shape.","temperament":"Rottweilers are calm, intelligent, and hard-working dogs. They make devoted companions and alert, protective, house dogs. A playful breed, they're also usually good with children.\n\nRottweilers are good guardians but have the reputation of being dominant and a bit territorial. They can be somewhat cautious with strangers—though they aren't big on barking.\n\nThey're an active breed that enjoys playing and having a job to do. Despite what some may assume, Rottweilers can be very gentle and loving dogs, particularly their families.","care-nutrition":"Rottweilers require a high-quality dog food that's age-appropriate—whether it's commercially made or prepared at home with guidance and approval from a veterinarian.\n\nIt's important to monitor the amount of food you feed your Rottweiler. Reduce portions if your pup gains weight, or cut back on treats—too many snacks on top of regular meals can cause obesity.","care-grooming":"Rottweilers require weekly brushing and regular baths. For most of the year, shedding is very moderate—though it will be more substantial in the spring and fall.\n\nWeekly nail trims and regular at-home dental care—including teeth brushing—are ideal for this breed.","care-exercise":"Though not necessarily energetic, Rottweilers are strong, athletic dogs that need a reasonable amount of daily exercise. Dog sports such as agility, tracking, herding, and obedience are all activities that the breed enjoys. Brisk walks, hikes, games of fetch, and even swimming are all good ways to wear out your pup.","care-training":"Rottweilers were bred to guard people and property. Firm and structured training will help temper their instinct to guard and help them be safe household companions.\n\n[Early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) with people and animals will help them become well-adjusted adult dogs. Because Rottweilers are a sensitive breed, they respond best to reward-based training using treats or favorite toys.\n\nRaised properly, Rottweilers can be relaxed, self-assured, and brave—but not overly aggressive. However, it's important not to engage in rough play with this breed, as it may encourage undesirable behaviors.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/rottweiler/\n\nhttps://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/dog-breeds/rottweiler","reviewed-by":"Annette Louviere, DVM","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":32.7,"weight-range-pet-max":59.9,"weight-range-show-min":38.1,"weight-range-show-max":54.4,"height-range-min":58.0,"height-range-max":69.0,"life-span-range-min":8.0,"life-span-range-max":12.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":100,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":63,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":41},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b848082a-f552-587e-9e87-9b62892b2231/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b848082a-f552-587e-9e87-9b62892b2231/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b848082a-f552-587e-9e87-9b62892b2231/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b848082a-f552-587e-9e87-9b62892b2231/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b848082a-f552-587e-9e87-9b62892b2231/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b848082a-f552-587e-9e87-9b62892b2231/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b848082a-f552-587e-9e87-9b62892b2231/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b848082a-f552-587e-9e87-9b62892b2231/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b848082a-f552-587e-9e87-9b62892b2231/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b848082a-f552-587e-9e87-9b62892b2231/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b848082a-f552-587e-9e87-9b62892b2231/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b848082a-f552-587e-9e87-9b62892b2231/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b848082a-f552-587e-9e87-9b62892b2231/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b848082a-f552-587e-9e87-9b62892b2231/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b848082a-f552-587e-9e87-9b62892b2231/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b848082a-f552-587e-9e87-9b62892b2231/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b848082a-f552-587e-9e87-9b62892b2231/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b848082a-f552-587e-9e87-9b62892b2231/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"b9ab993b-da80-54a6-9fc0-e5d48e4bc50f","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/b9ab993b-da80-54a6-9fc0-e5d48e4bc50f"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"puli","name":"Puli","plural-name":"Pulik","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"Experts believe that the Magyar, a nomadic tribe from Asia, brought Pulik (the plural of Puli) to the Hungarian plains more than a thousand years ago. Pulik were revered for their skills, herding large flocks of sheep across harsh terrain; their corded coats protected them from the extreme climate.\n\nIn the seventeenth century, interbreeding threatened the breed, which teetered on the verge of extinction until 1912 when efforts to increase the number of Pulik helped boost the population. The first breed standard then formed in 1915.","facts":"The Puli is a loyal, smart herding dog that traces its origins to Hungary; there, it's a popular working dog. In the United States, people may recognize the breed by its unique corded coat and affectionate personality.","traits-appearance":"The Puli is a medium-sized dog with almost square proportions. These dogs are vigorous, acrobatic, alert, and active; they move with a distinctive quick-stepping gait.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Pulik have dense, weather-resistant coats that are profuse all over their bodies.\n\nTheir undercoat is soft and woolly, while their outer coats are wavy or curly. The hair on their coats clumps together and, when allowed to grow, forms woolly cords of varying shapes and thicknesses that are either flat or round. The cording gets longer with age and may eventually reach the ground. The show standard allows both corded and brushed coats.\n\nPulik come in four solid colors: black, rusty black, gray (all shades), and white. Black and gray dogs can have gray, black, or white hairs, but they must maintain their overall solid-colored appearance.","traits-physical":"Pulik have medium-boned bodies with level, strong backs and moderately broad, deep chests. They have short, strong loins, and muscular hindquarters.\n\nThese dogs also have straight muzzles, hanging, V-shaped ears, and large, almond-shaped, dark brown eyes with black or slate gray rims.","temperament":"Though bred to work, Pulik are now known as homebodies that delight in spending time with their families. They are affectionate, faithful companions, but their herding instincts remain intact. Pulik may herd other animals and children—but always with a gentle touch.\n\nPulik are adaptable enough to thrive in many different living situations. Their natural suspicion of strangers makes them excellent guard dogs.","care-nutrition":"Feed the Puli a high-quality dog food that is appropriate for their life stage (puppy, adult, senior) and consider a diet formulated for active breeds. Portion out their food with a measuring cup and limit treats to no more than 10 percent of their daily calories to avoid overfeeding.","care-grooming":"Achieving a beautiful coat requires care. Puppies need regular baths, but their hair won't yet form cords.\n\nAround eight to ten months, Pulik start getting their undercoats. Their hair will begin to feel thick and matted, and those clumps of hair must be separated into quarter-sized sections to start creating cords. Mature cords shouldn't get brushed, but occasional baths will help keep your Puli's coat clean. Their cords will need occasional separation.\n\nPulik also require regular ear cleanings, nail trims, and a [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) routine that includes at-home teeth brushing and professional cleanings.","care-exercise":"Pulik are energetic dogs that require lots of exercise. In addition to brisk walks, Pulik do well in dog sports such as agility, obedience, and herding. Mental stimulation is important, too. Play games like hide and seek or offer puzzle toys to keep these active, intelligent dogs are engaged.","care-training":"Pulik are intelligent, keen to learn new things, and eager to please, making them excellent students.\n\nThese dogs are also headstrong and require consistent training to help them master commands. Focus on positive reinforcement and rewards-based training.

Some experts believe they're descendants of primitive dogs from Asia—despite evidence that seems to contradict such ancient roots. Regardless, we know that modern-day Carolina Dogs hail from the swamps and forests of South Carolina and Georgia.\n\nDr. I. Lehr Brisbin Jr. discovered these free-roaming dogs in the 1970s and began documenting their characteristics and behaviors. He named them Carolina Dogs and played a key role in earning the breed recognition from the United Kennel Club in 1995.\n\nMany Carolina Dogs are semi-wild and live in extremely remote, isolated areas. Also known as \"swamp dogs,\" Carolinas have evolved naturally and still share many qualities—including hunting techniques and reproductive behaviors—with other wild canines. Today, their population is declining due to ongoing domestication and interbreeding with other dogs.","facts":"The Carolina Dog is an adaptable, intelligent, independent breed. Though not often overly friendly with strangers, these pups form tight bonds with their humans and love to be included in daily routines.","traits-appearance":"Carolina Dogs are medium-sized pups that resemble Australian Dingoes. They have thin, tight builds and medium-length, straight backs.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"In the winter, Carolinas have heavier coats with a thicker undercoat than they do in the summer. The breed's hair is short and smooth on the head, ears, and front legs and longer and coarser on the neck, back, and withers.\n\nCarolina Dogs typically come in shades of red ginger with pale, buff markings on the shoulders and white on the muzzle. They can also come in black and tan, piebald, and solid black.","traits-physical":"Carolinas have large, upright, forward-pointing ears set on the top of the head. It's common for them to keep one ear pricked while rotating the other to pick up sounds—a quality that's as adorable as it is functional.\n\nTheir almond-shaped eyes are typically brown and give an intelligent but cautious expression. And their long, graceful necks are muscular and well-arched—perfect for hunting prey in tall grass. Carolinas also have very expressive tails. When alert, they carry them in a characteristic \"fishhook,\" and they hold them in a downward \"pump handle\" configuration when trotting.","temperament":"These pack-oriented pups make affectionate, loyal family pets. They typically get along well with children and—provided they have had time to get used to \"kid energy\"—are willing playmates.\n\nCarolina Dogs are also intelligent with a shy, gentle nature. Though often suspicious of strangers, they form tight bonds once they recognize a human as part of their pack. Their natural tendency to bark if someone they don't know enters their territory makes them excellent watchdogs. They are not, however, guard dogs that will readily protect people or property.\n\nBecause of their strong hunting instincts, Carolina Dogs may not be well-suited for homes with small pets. For this same reason, you should always keep your pup leashed when out and about to prevent them from chasing neighborhood critters.","care-nutrition":"Carolina Dogs thrive on a high-quality diet formulated for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). To maintain their naturally lean body type, measure out their food portions to avoid overfeeding. And don't forget to account for calories from treats. As a guideline, they should make up no more than 10% of a dog's daily calories.","care-grooming":"Occasional brushing will keep a Carolina's coat free of loose fur and looking its best. During winter months, when their coat is thickest, more frequent brushing may be required. Regular nail trims should also be part of their grooming routine. Keeping their nails clipped will prevent them from growing too long and causing pain or leading to problems running or walking.\n\nJust like humans, all dogs need [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care). Dental disease is one of the most common health conditions in adult dogs. And it can contribute to other serious issues if left untreated. So, in addition to professional cleanings, start brushing your pup's teeth at home and giving them the occasional veterinarian-recommended dental chew.","care-exercise":"Carolina Dogs are not hyperactive, but they do need daily activity to exercise their bodies and minds. Fun options include long walks, hikes, games of fetch, and indoor games—such as hide-and-seek. Agility courses, fly ball, and rally are also great ways for them to burn off excess energy","care-training":"Carolinas are intelligent, eager-to-please dogs. That said, they must recognize their humans as leaders of the pack. Otherwise, they may ignore commands and instead opt to do their own thing. It's best to get every household member involved in the training so all can establish themselves as higher up in the hierarchy.\n\n[Early socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) is also essential for this shy, sometimes suspicious breed. Introducing them to different people and surroundings when they're young will help your pup develop into a well-mannered adult

des Flandres","plural-name":"Bouviers des Flandres","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The Bouvier des Flandres was once known as koehond (cow dog), toucher de boeuf or pic (cattle driver) and vuilbaard (dirty beard). The current breed name translates to cowherd of Flanders and honors its work as herding dogs.\n\nThe breed dates back to medieval times, originating in Flanders, a region that encompassed areas of the countries now known as France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. The Bouviers des Flandres were well-rounded working dogs that helped with herding, guarding livestock, protecting farms, and pulling carts. It is their strong work ethic that might have saved the breed from extinction.\n\nDuring World War I, farms across Europe became battlefields, displacing farmers and their dogs; Bouviers des Flandres found work as ambulance and messenger dogs for the Belgian military. The breed is still used for important work in farming, military and police K9 units, and as service dogs.","facts":"Bouviers des Flandres are intelligent and affectionate dogs with huge hearts. A working dog breed, the Bouvier des Flandres is a strong-willed and courageous animal that excels in the roles of watchdog and guardian.","traits-appearance":"Bouviers des Flandres are compact dogs with a powerful build and rugged appearance. These dogs move with a bold, proud gait, driving forward from the strength in their hindquarters.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Bouviesr des Flandres have a double coat that includes a fine, soft, and dense undercoat with an outercoat of rough, harsh hairs that are tousled but not curly, and capable of withstanding the elements. The hair on the overcoat should be no more than two-and-a-half inches long; it is shorter on the upper back and upper side of the muzzle, while the upper lip and chin have longer hair, creating the hallmark moustache and beard that give the Bouvier des Flandres its gruff expression. Their hair can be trimmed slightly to accent the body line but should not be over trimmed.\n\nThe Bouvier des Flandres comes in several colors, including black, brindle, fawn, gray brindle, and pepper and salt. A small white star on the chest is allowed in show.","traits-physical":"These powerful working dogs are strong-boned and well-muscled with broad chests, muscular shoulders, long legs, firm hindquarters, and docked tails. Bouviers des Flandres have heads that are impressive in scale with broad muzzles; ears placed high and alert; and oval, dark brown eyes that convey a bold and alert expression.","temperament":"Described as steady, resolute, and fearless, Bouviers des Flandres are the quintessential working dogs that eagerly tackle a task and persist until it’s complete. Their legendary work ethics must be accommodated; without myriad things to do, Bouviers des Flandres become bored and unhappy.\n\nBouviers des Flandres also have huge hearts and are affectionate, loyal companions. They thrive in homes where owners devote ample time to their physical and emotional wellbeing and help these strong-willed dogs channel their energy in positive directions. The Bouvier des Flandres is not an apartment dog; the breed does best in homes where there is room to roam and lots of opportunities to engage in high-energy activities.","care-nutrition":"Feed Bouviers des Flandres a high-quality dog food that is appropriate for their life stage (puppy, adult, senior) and consider a diet formulated for active breeds. To keep the Bouvier des Flandres fit and trim, portion out their food with a measuring cup and limit treats to no more than 10% of their daily calories.","care-grooming":"Brush Bouviers des Flandres at least once per week to remove dead hair and keep their coats free of tangles, mats, and debris. Their beards may also need cleaning. Bouviers des Flandres have fast-growing nails that will need to be trimmed every one to two weeks to prevent them from becoming overgrown and causing pain or discomfort when they walk.\n\nLike all breeds, Bouviers des Flandres benefit from a regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) routine that includes at-home teeth brushing and professional cleanings.","care-exercise":"Bouviers des Flandres are working dogs that require ample exercise. In active households, these dogs love brisk walks, hiking, and trips to the dog park. These highly intelligent dogs also excel in dog sports such as agility, obedience, rally, and, of course, herding.\n\nWithout adequate exercise, Bouviers des Flandres can become bored and destructive. Games and puzzle toys can help Bouviers des Flandres keep their minds engaged.","care-training":"Bouviers des Flandres are smart and eager to please. With consistent training, Bouvier des Flandres can learn everything from basic commands and tricks to important jobs such as search and rescue. Focus on positive reinforcement and rewards-based training. Avoid repetitive activities, which will cause these dogs to lose interest in training.\n\nThese dogs love spending time with their owners and will see training as a bonding experience. Invite Bouviers des Flandres to tag along to new places and introduce them to new people to provide important socialization; these experiences, coupled with training, can help reduce or control their strong prey drive.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/bouvier-des-flandres/\n\nhttp://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/BouvierdesFlandres.pdf","reviewed-by":"Laura

Husky","plural-name":"Siberians","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The Siberian Husky is an ancient breed with a long history of helping mankind. Experts think the breed began with the Chukchi tribe of Siberia. When weather changes forced this semi-nomadic tribe to expand their hunting grounds, they needed a dog that could pull light loads long distances in sub-zero temperatures—without expending a lot of energy. The Siberian Husky was the result of those breeding efforts.\n\nIn addition to pulling sleds, the Siberian Husky has been given several jobs throughout history. These include herding reindeer, keeping children warm, and working as search and rescue dogs during World War II.\n\nSiberian Huskies became famous in 1925 when they traveled 658 miles in less than six days to deliver diphtheria serum after the city of Nome, Alaska, was stricken by an epidemic. The Iditarod dog sled race commemorates this feat. Huskies also transported various other medications to the ill.\n\nThe Siberian Husky came to America in 1909, and the popularity of the breed has grown significantly ever since. It's now one of the most popular Arctic breeds.\n\nThe AKC did not recognize the Siberian Husky until 1930—the same year the Soviet government stopped the exportation of the breed by closing the borders of Siberia to external trade.","facts":"The Siberian Husky is a very intelligent breed that's active, alert, and gentle. Huskies show great ability in a range of activities and can adapt to different living environments. Their love of people and demeanor around children make Siberian Huskies wonderful pets and companions.","traits-appearance":"True to their northern heritage, Siberian Huskies have a compact body, erect ears, and a thick coat and tail. They are built for a combination of power, endurance, and speed.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Siberian Huskies have a double coat—a soft, dense undercoat and a straight, somewhat smooth outer coat.\n\nThe breed standard permits any color, though the dog can be black, silver, or a variety of tans. These are generally shaded and mixed with white markings, leading to varied wolfish markings on the head and muzzle.","traits-physical":"Siberian Huskies can have blue or amber eyes, and they sometimes have one of each color.\n\nMedium, triangular-shaped ears sit high on their heads. They are thick, well-furred, and have slightly rounded tips that point straight up.\n\nHuskies have bushy, fox brush-shaped tails that carry over their backs in a sickle curve when the dog is at attention.","temperament":"Siberian Huskies are excellent with children and usually friendly to everyone, making them fantastic family dogs. However, this love of people means they are not natural guard dogs.\n\nBecause Siberian Huskies enjoy company so much, they should not be left alone for long periods. Otherwise, they may become destructive. Huskies are happiest when they're with their people—whether playing games in the backyard or going on outings with the family. And if it's cold and snowy outside, all the better!\n\nThis breed is typically good-natured and social towards other dogs but can be unpredictable with smaller pets. Huskies do also have the tendency to chase wildlife and, given the chance, would roam for hours. For these reasons, they should be in a fenced yard or on a leash when outdoors.","care-nutrition":"To meet their nutritional needs, you should feed Siberian Huskies a high-quality food that's appropriate for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, or senior).\n\nFor the working Siberian Husky, you should adjust diets seasonally: increase protein during the winter months when they're pulling sleds, and decrease it in the summer when they're not as active.\n\nBecause of their thick coats, it can be difficult to visually assess a Siberian Husky's body condition. To get a more accurate understanding, use your hands to feel along their rib cage. When at an appropriate weight, you should be able to easily feel the ribs. If you notice any weight gain, restrict calories until they return to an ideal weight.","care-grooming":"Siberian Huskies are naturally clean dogs that don't require frequent bathing. Most of the year, brushing their coat once or twice a week will help keep it clean and healthy.\n\nTwice a year, they will shed their undercoat. During these periods, more frequent brushing with a pin brush or metal comb will help remove the old coat. You can trim fur around the feet and toes to keep paws clean and tidy, but no other fur on the body should be trimmed.\n\nA Siberian Husky's nails need to be cut regularly. Nails that get overly long can cause pain and potentially lead to problems running or walking.\n\nLike all dog breeds, Siberian Huskies require regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care), including at-home teeth brushing and professional dental cleanings. Maintaining good dental hygiene is important for their overall long-term health, and the sooner you get them into a good dental care routine, the better.","care-exercise":"To be happy, Siberian Huskies need lots of attention and physical exercise. They enjoy participating in dog sports such as sledding, skijoring (pulling a skier), and carting. You can also take them on daily long walks or, even better, long jogs.\n\nWhen adequately exercised, Siberian Huskies are typically calm housemates. However, if they don't get enough physical activity they may turn to digging, chewing, or other undesirable behaviors.","care-training":"Siberian Huskies are quite independent. So you should start training— firmly, consistently, and gently—from an early age. Reward-based training using small treats and favorite toys can help mitigate their stubborn tendencies.\n\n[Obedience training](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-obedience-training) will also provide them with much-needed mental exercise.","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/siberian-husky/\n\nhttps://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/dog-breeds/siberian-husky\n\nhttp://www.fci.be/Nomenclature/Standards/270g05-en.pdf","reviewed-by":"Annette

of the Dalmatian dates to at least the 1700s—though there are images that look similar to the breed dating back thousands of years. The exact origin of the Dalmatian is highly-disputed. However, most people believe that the breed developed in Dalmatia, a region in southwestern Croatia that borders the eastern Adriatic Sea.\n\nThe name Dalmatia or \"Delmatia\" comes from the ancient Illyrian word meaning \"land of shepherds.\" And it was from this area that the breed received its name.\n\nIn 17th century England, Dalmatians worked as carriage dogs. Their speed, protective nature, and coaching instincts were invaluable when tasked with accompanying carriages and horseback riders and protecting them from threats along their journey. Later, Dalmatians put that same skill set to good use in their iconic role as firehouse dogs. They ran alongside horse-drawn fire engines and helped them maneuver through busy city streets.\n\nDalmatians received AKC recognition in 1888.","facts":"The Dalmatian is a calm and gentle—but very active and intelligent—breed. As a result, Dalmations tend to make good-natured, relatively easy-to-train, and obedient dogs. They're also very loving, affectionate, and devoted to their families.","traits-appearance":"With its famously spotted coat, the Dalmatian is not only one of the most recognizable breeds but also one of the oldest. Though no one knows the exact date, some believe Dalmatians have existed for more than four thousand years.\n\nThe Dalmatian is an eye-catching dog with a distinctive spotted coat, poised and alert posture, and a muscular build.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Dalmatian puppies are born white and later develop spots between the size of a dime and a half-dollar. And, while a variety of coat colors are possible, black or liver are considered breed standard with the dog's nose sharing the color of its spots. The distribution of a Dalmatian's spots is typically even, though there are generally more on the ears.\n\nDalmatians coats are short, dense, fine, and close-fitting. They are sleek, glossy, and have a very healthy appearance.","traits-physical":"Dalmatians have medium-sized, somewhat rounded eyes set moderately well apart. These can be brown or blue. (Occasionally, a Dalmatian has one eye of each color.)\n\nTheir ears are moderately sized, set high, and carried close to the head. They're triangular-shaped—wide at the base and tapering gradually to a rounded tip.\n\nA Dalmatian's tail tapers to the tip and has a slight upward curve.","temperament":"Dalmations are an excellent breed for families that can provide frequent exercise and an active lifestyle. Without adequate exercise, Dalmatians may become hyper or turn to destructive behaviors.\n\nThough they're friendly dogs that love being with people, their energetic temperament makes them best suited for families with relatively older children.\n\nDalmatians tend to be loyal and affectionate with their families, and friendly with other pets. But they can be aloof with strangers, and male Dalmatians sometimes display territorial aggression toward each other. [Proper socialization](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization) can help with these behaviors.","care-nutrition":"As with all dogs, Dalmatians need high-quality food that's appropriate for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). And food portions and treats must be monitored to prevent obesity. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of a dog's daily calories.\n\nDalmatians are prone to urate stones, so a special diet—low in purines, moderate in protein, high in complex carbohydrates, and low in fat and salt—can help. Breed-specific and prescription formulas are available. Your veterinarian will be your best resource for choosing the right diet for your Dalmatian.","care-grooming":"The Dalmatian's coat is relatively easy to maintain. Brushing once a week is typically all it takes to keep it shiny and free of loose hair.\n\nRoutine trimming helps keep a Dalmatian's nails at an ideal length, thereby preventing walking issues.\n\nMaintaining good [dental hygiene](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) is essential for your dog's overall long-term health. In addition to professional dental cleanings, you should create an at-home routine that includes regular teeth brushing.","care-exercise":"Dalmatians are extremely high-energy dogs that need daily mental and physical exercise. They make great hiking or running buddies and love to race around in a fenced backyard.\n\nDue to their stamina and athletic ability, Dalmatians excel at dog sports such as agility, flyball, tracking, scent hurdling, and both rally and competitive obedience.","care-training":"Dalmatians want nothing more than to please their families, and they love praise. Not surprisingly, this makes them very receptive to positive reinforcement and [reward-based training](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-obedience-training).","care-health":null,"references":"https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/lifestyle/dalmation-breed-facts/\n\nhttp://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/Dalmatian.pdf\n\nhttps://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/dog-breeds/dalmatian\n\nhttps://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/dalmatian/","reviewed-by":"Cindy Elston, DVM, MPH","date-reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":17.7,"weight-range-pet-max":34.0,"weight-range-show-min":18.1,"weight-range-show-max":29.5,"height-range-min":58.0,"height-range-max":61.0,"life-span-range-min":11.0,"life-span-range-max":13.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":101,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":65,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":43},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/bd04e067-a4d4-5a52-9fa5-acf39a170192/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/bd04e067-a4d4-5a52-9fa5-acf39a170192/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/bd04e067-a4d4-5a52-9fa5-acf39a170192/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/bd04e067-a4d4-5a52-9fa5-acf39a170192/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/bd04e067-a4d4-5a52-9fa5-acf39a170192/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/bd04e067-a4d4-5a52-9fa5-acf39a170192/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/bd04e067-a4d4-5a52-9fa5-acf39a170192/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/bd04e067-a4d4-5a52-9fa5-acf39a170192/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/bd04e067-a4d4-5a52-9fa5-acf39a170192/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/bd04e067-a4d4-5a52-9fa5-acf39a170192/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/bd04e067-a4d4-5a52-9fa5-acf39a170192/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/bd04e067-a4d4-5a52-9fa5-acf39a170192/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/bd04e067-a4d4-5a52-9fa5-acf39a170192/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/bd04e067-a4d4-5a52-9fa5-acf39a170192/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/bd04e067-a4d4-5a52-9fa5-acf39a170192/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/bd04e067-a4d4-5a52-9fa5-acf39a170192/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/bd04e067-a4d4-5a52-9fa5-acf39a170192/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/bd04e067-a4d4-5a52-9fa5-acf39a170192/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"bd281524-4d3f-5268-a1aa-c900a924efc0","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/bd281524-4d3f-5268-a1aa-c900a924efc0"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"kooikerhondje","name":"Kooikerhondje","plural-name":"Kooikerhondjes","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"The Nederlandse Kooikerhondje—pronounced \"KOY ker hond yeh\"—is an old spaniel breed that came out of the Netherlands in the 17th century. Kooikers primarily functioned as decoy dogs for duck hunting, which is how they got their name. The breed name translates roughly to \"little caging dog,\" most likely a reference to \"eendenkooi \"(a cage to trap ducks).\n\nWhen the popularity of decoy duck hunting declined after World War I, so did the need for the Kooikerhondje. As a result, the breed nearly went extinct. But in 1939, the Baroness Hardenbroek van Ammerstol set out to preserve the Kooiker in protest of the occupation of the Netherlands. She located a single male and two female Kooikers from the north of the country and began a breeding program. By 1945, her efforts resulted in 25 known Kooikerhondje.\n\nThe Dutch Kennel Club, Raad van Beheer, officially recognized the Kooiker in 1971. Though it's growing in popularity in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, the Kooiker is still a rare breed.\n\nToday, the Kooikerhondje supports the conservation of the Netherlands' native wetlands and culture by helping trap waterfowl for banding and identification.","facts":"The Nederlandse Kooikerhondje is a spirited, trainable breed that excels at agility, obedience, and hunting. Known as the \"little white and orange dog with a big heart,\" the Kooikerhondje is a natural fit for families wanting a high-energy, loyal pet.","traits-appearance":"A small sporting dog, the Kooikerhondje is harmoniously built with almost square body proportions.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Kooiker's medium-length coat can be slightly wavy or straight. Though soft, it's textured enough to be weather-resistant. The coat is orange-and-white spotted, with black shading (sable).","traits-physical":"The Kooikerhondje has almond-shaped, dark brown eyes and a friendly, alert expression. Feathering on the ears gives the impression of earrings. The tail is well-feathered with a white plume and curls upward when walking.","temperament":"Kooikers are happy, well-behaved dogs that love spending time with their people. Because they tend to be fairly quiet, Kooikerhondjes are a good breed for apartments or homes with small yards.\n\nKooikerhondjes can be reactive around other dogs, especially when on a leash. And dog parks are not generally a good fit for them. To help your Kooiker become a well-mannered dog, [start socializing them early](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/puppy-socialization).\n\nAs long as they get plenty of physical exercise and mental stimulation, Kooikerhondjes make easy-going, good-natured, affectionate companions. But they may be slow to warm up to strangers.","care-nutrition":"Kooikerhondjes need a high-quality diet that's appropriate for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior) and activity level. To prevent them from becoming overweight, keep a close eye on their food portions. And be sure to take treats into account when tracking their daily calorie intake. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of a dog's calories.","care-grooming":"Kooikers are very low-maintenance when it comes to grooming. Simply brush them once a week, and occasionally trim the hair around their paws. Because their coats naturally repel dirt, baths are rarely necessary.\n\nKooikerhondjes' long ears are more susceptible to ear infections. So, check and clean your dog's ears routinely to prevent infections. Your Kooiker's nails may wear down during daily activity. But you should still trim them periodically to prevent pain and other problems that arise from overly long nails.\n\nFinally, maintaining good [dental hygiene](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) is essential for the overall long-term health of all dogs.

It was then and there that a farm kitten with a sparse, wiry coat and crinkly whiskers was born to two normal-coated parents. Local cat breeder Joan O'Shea took the kitten and bred him to a neighboring female cat, resulting in a litter of similar wirehaired kittens. The second round of breeding confirmed that the gene causing the wire coat was dominant.\n\nO'Shea sent hair samples to a British geneticist, who concluded that they differed from the hair of other curly-coated breeds—such as the Cornish Rex or Devon Rex. In other words, O'Shea had stumbled upon a novel gene mutation.\n\nThis new breed most closely resembled the American Shorthair, which breeders used for initial outcrossings. The CFA accepted the American Wirehair for registration in 1967 and granted Championship status in 1978. And to this day, no other country has reported the wirehair mutation. It is truly an American original.","facts":"American Wirehairs are intelligent, good-natured cats and popular family pets. Though they love spending time with their humans, they're relatively independent and comfortable doing their own thing.","traits-appearance":"American Wirehairs are medium-to-large cats with springy, wiry coats. They have well-balanced, muscular bodies and sweet expressions.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"Wirehairs come in all colors and patterns. Made of crimped, hooked, or bent hairs, their medium-length coats are very dense and coarse but relatively soft to the touch.\n\nThe wiriness comes in degrees and varies from spiky to curly. And the gene that causes it is an incomplete dominant—meaning the dominant gene doesn't always totally mask the recessive gene. As a result, some kittens in a litter may have straight coats.","traits-physical":"The American Wirehair's key features include a round head with prominent cheekbones, a well-developed muzzle, medium ears with slightly rounded tips, and large, round eyes.","temperament":"American Wirehairs are people-oriented cats that quickly turn strangers into friends. Their relaxed, gentle nature and patience with kids make them ideal pets for families.\n\nThough laid-back, Wirehairs are quite playful and remain spunky even into their senior years. When not engaging in games with their humans, they like to watch birds from the window and keep an eye on the neighborhood from a high shelf or perch. When it's time to relax, some Wirehairs will curl up in a lap, but others prefer to hang out on nearby furniture.\n\nTrue to their farm cat roots, Wirehairs are diligent hunters. (Insects, beware.)","care-nutrition":"American Wirehairs need a high-quality diet formulated for their current life stage (e.g., kitten, adult, senior).\n\nObesity is on the rise in cats and can lead to other serious health issues. To keep your cat at an appropriate weight, measure out meals and reduce portions if necessary. And don't forget to account for treats. As a guideline, they should make up no more than 10% of a cat's calories.\n\nLastly, all felines need access to fresh, clean water around the clock.","care-grooming":"Oil from American Wirehairs' skin can cause their coats to become greasy. As such, they require frequent baths to remove grease—along with loose hairs. This breed is also prone to earwax build-up. So, check your cat's ears regularly and clean them with a cotton ball and vet-approved cleaning solution as needed.\n\nMost cats' nails require monthly trimming to prevent them from getting too long. Long nails are more likely to snag on something and become torn or damaged. They can even grow into your cat's paw pads, leading to pain or infection. In addition to clipping, providing a scratching post will allow your cat to do some nail maintenance themselves (thanks to their instinct to scratch).\n\nGood dental hygiene is essential to a Wirehair's overall health. An ideal dental routine includes daily at-home teeth brushing combined with visits to the veterinarian for professional dental cleanings and exams.","care-exercise":null,"care-training":null,"care-health":"Some American Wirehairs have sensitive skin and can have allergic reactions to environmental influences. Regular bathing should help keep potential problems at bay. But if you notice signs of skin irritation, ask your veterinarian about the appropriate treatment.","references":"https://tica.org/breeds/browse-all-breeds?view=article&id=821:american-wirehair-breed&catid=79\n\nhttps://www.royalcanin.com/us/cats/breeds/breed-library/american-wirehair\n\nhttps://cfa.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/american-wirehair-standard.pdf\n\nhttps://cfa.org/american-wirehair/american-wirehair-article/","reviewed-by":"Annette Louviere, DVM","date-reviewed":"2021-02-23T00:03:00.000Z","weight-range-pet-min":3.6,"weight-range-pet-max":6.8,"weight-range-show-min":null,"weight-range-show-max":null,"height-range-min":null,"height-range-max":null,"life-span-range-min":14.0,"life-span-range-max":18.0,"recommended-activity-mins-young":null,"recommended-activity-mins-adult":null,"recommended-activity-mins-senior":null},"relationships":{"breed-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/bd28a9ff-78f5-5721-9d59-576f4e4869ed/relationships/breed-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/bd28a9ff-78f5-5721-9d59-576f4e4869ed/breed-group"}},"breed-size-group":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/bd28a9ff-78f5-5721-9d59-576f4e4869ed/relationships/breed-size-group","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/bd28a9ff-78f5-5721-9d59-576f4e4869ed/breed-size-group"}},"breed-insights":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/bd28a9ff-78f5-5721-9d59-576f4e4869ed/relationships/breed-insights","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/bd28a9ff-78f5-5721-9d59-576f4e4869ed/breed-insights"}},"breed-ordered-images":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/bd28a9ff-78f5-5721-9d59-576f4e4869ed/relationships/breed-ordered-images","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/bd28a9ff-78f5-5721-9d59-576f4e4869ed/breed-ordered-images"}},"head-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/bd28a9ff-78f5-5721-9d59-576f4e4869ed/relationships/head-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/bd28a9ff-78f5-5721-9d59-576f4e4869ed/head-image"}},"color-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/bd28a9ff-78f5-5721-9d59-576f4e4869ed/relationships/color-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/bd28a9ff-78f5-5721-9d59-576f4e4869ed/color-image"}},"bw-image":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/bd28a9ff-78f5-5721-9d59-576f4e4869ed/relationships/bw-image","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/bd28a9ff-78f5-5721-9d59-576f4e4869ed/bw-image"}},"health-tests":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/bd28a9ff-78f5-5721-9d59-576f4e4869ed/relationships/health-tests","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/bd28a9ff-78f5-5721-9d59-576f4e4869ed/health-tests"}},"diversity-reference":{"links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/bd28a9ff-78f5-5721-9d59-576f4e4869ed/relationships/diversity-reference","related":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/bd28a9ff-78f5-5721-9d59-576f4e4869ed/diversity-reference"}}}},{"id":"be011d8b-ca05-5016-81c0-0ef59b516df5","type":"breeds","links":{"self":"http://localhost:3000/api/v1/breeds/be011d8b-ca05-5016-81c0-0ef59b516df5"},"attributes":{"reported-anywhere":true,"reported-uk":true,"reported-gb":true,"reported-us":true,"country-codes":["US","GB"],"slug":"bergamasco","name":"Bergamasco","plural-name":"Bergamascos","published-at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","species":"dog","history":"In pre-Roman times, the Phoenicians often bartered sheepdogs around the Mediterranean basin, allowing the ancestors of the Bergamasco Sheepdog to spread throughout Europe and the Middle East.\n\nThe breed became known as the Bergamasco Sheepdog because of the breed's association with the Italian town of Bergamo. There is some debate about the origins of the alpine breed: Some believe that the Bergamasco descended from an ancient Gaelic herding dog called the Briard while others insist that the Bergamasco came first and led to the development of the Briard. It is agreed that both sheepdog breeds excelled in their roles guarding and moving sheep on the rugged terrain in the Italian Alps.\n\nThe Bergamasco’s numbers started declining after World War II but renewed interest in the breed—and the 2015 addition of the Bergamasco to the American Kennel Club stud book—could help the working dog become more popular.","facts":"The Bergamasco proves that looks can be deceiving. The tangle-haired breed is not just an adorable companion; these independent dogs are vigilant guard dogs with strong protective instincts.","traits-appearance":"The Bergamasco is a compact herding dog. Beneath their flocks of hair, the Bergamasco is a muscular and heavy-boned breed with calm, balanced movements.","traits-coat-and-coloring":"The Bergamasco has three different kinds of hair: Their undercoats are short, dense, and fine; it feels oily to the touch and forms a waterproof layer against the skin. Their outercoats and a layer known as “goat hair” are not distributed evenly over their bodies, creating the characteristic strands of woven hair that fall in flat, felted layers—called flocks—that give the Bergamasco its unique appearance. The goat hair is long, straight, and has a rough texture while the outer coat is woolly and finer in texture.\n\nThe flocks range from one-and-a-half to three inches wide; they are flat, irregular in shape, larger at the base than the ends, and can open in a fan shape. Flocks are never combed out. The Bergamasco has more goat hair on its head and from the withers to the midpoint of its body, while the outer coat is more abundant on the back of the body and the legs.\n\nThe Bergamasco is solid gray in color; gradations of gray, including merle (up to and including solid black) and shadings of Isabella and fawn on the lower part of the flocks are also allowed in show. The breed standard does not allow standard white, but white markings are acceptable provided they do not cover more than 20% of the body.","traits-physical":"The Bergamasco is a large dog with massive, strong shoulders; muscular thighs; and strong, arched necks. These dogs have large, oval, brown eyes, and soft, thin ears that hang down on either side of their faces.","temperament":"Although Bergamascos have a distinct look that attracts a lot of attention, these dogs might not want strangers in its space. The Bergamasco is a vigilant guard dog with a strong protective instinct. While the breed is not known for being aggressive without cause, it can be standoffish with strangers. The Bergamasco is also patient, quiet, eager to please, and affectionate, making it a good companion for those in its trusted circle.\n\nThe Bergamasco is used to patrolling wide open spaces and still prefers room to roam. It will do best in a home with a large, fenced yard and is not well-suited to apartment living.","care-nutrition":"Feed Bergamascos a high-quality dog food that is appropriate for their life stage (puppy, adult, senior) and consider a diet formulated for active breeds. Portion out their food with a standard measuring cup and limit treats to no more than 10% of their daily calories to avoid overfeeding and prevent weight gain.","care-grooming":"Despite their well-coiffed appearance, the Bergamasco has a maintenance-free coat once the flocks are established. Puppies do not have goat or wool hair on their outer coats; it comes in when the dogs are around one year old. When it appears, the coat must be “ripped” into flocks, which can take a few hours but it needs no further maintenance after that.\n\nBergamascos are a non-shedding breed and their hair requires no brushing; these dogs rarely even need baths! The thick coats help Bergamascos regulate their temperatures and should never be shaved.\n\nTrim their nails to prevent cracking, splitting, and painful overgrowths, and clean their ears. Regular [dental care](https://www.wisdompanel.com/en-us/blog/dog-dental-care) that includes at-home teeth brushing and professional cleanings is also an essential part of their grooming routines.","care-exercise":"Bergamascos are a moderately active breed that enjoys going for walks playing in a fenced yard, especially when it means spending quality time with their owners. They may also enjoy dog sports such as agility, herding, flyball, and competitive obedience. Provide opportunities for mental and physical stimulation such as games and puzzle toys to keep this intelligent breed engaged and active.","care-training":"Bergamascos are intelligent and eager to please, a combination that makes them easy to train. A consistent training program that incorporates positive reinforcement and rewards can allow them to become well-mannered adults. The social, intelligent breed also requires regular socialization to help them feel comfortable with strangers and could also temper their protective
