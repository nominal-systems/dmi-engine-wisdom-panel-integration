          "en": "The Pudelpointer originated in Germany in the late 1800s. At that time, German sportsmen were developing gun dogs suited to their way of hunting. A well-known author and expert on hunting dogs, who wrote under the pen name Hegewald, convinced hunters to cross [Poodles]({%breedURL poodle-standard%}) with [English Pointers]({%breedURL pointer%}). His goal was to create a breed that combined the Poodle's love of water, trainability, retrieving skills, and protective coat with the English Pointer's keen nose, pointing instincts, and zeal for hunting.\n\nBreeders used far more Pointers than Poodles when establishing the breeding program. And once they achieved the look and character they were after, they no longer relied on Pointers and, instead, mated Pudelpointers to other Pudelpointers. The breed register was founded in 1892, and breeders formed the first Pudelpointer club in 1897.\n\nH.D. Hume and Sigbot Winterhelt introduced the breed to North America in 1956. Today, most Pudelpointers are bred in Germany or the United States. The United Kennel Club recognized the breed in 2006, and the American Kennel Club has recorded it in their Foundation Stock Service since 2016."

Breeders sought to develop an excellent pointer with a good nose—a dog that could retrieve birds as well as animals.\n\nInitially, German hunters thought that a cross between a Spanish Pointer and Hannover Hound would possess these abilities. However, the resulting breed tended to bay when trailing. They then tried crosses with the Bloodhound, Foxhound, and various French hounds. But none hit the mark precisely.\n\nBreeding with the English Pointer finally resulted in a dog that appeared perfect. Still, even this breed had an aversion to water and tracking at times. Fortunately, continuous breeding eliminated these unwanted traits. And the German Shorthaired Pointer became a lean, athletic, and responsive breed.\n\nThe German Kennel Club first registered the breed in 1872. German Shorthaired Pointers arrived in the United States in the 1920s. Impressed by the versatility of the breed after reading an article about it, a man named Charles R. Thornton shipped two dogs to his home in Missoula, Montana.\n\nThe American Kennel Club recognized the German Shorthaired Pointer as a breed in 1930. Today, it's consistently one of the top-winning breeds in competitive hunting events."

          "en": "The Wirehaired Pointing Griffon originated in Holland in the late 19th century. Eduard Korthals—a Dutch sportsman and breeder who studied canine genetics—wanted to create the ultimate walking hunter's gundog.\n\nKorthals owned many different dogs and carefully planned his breeding program. He wanted a breed that could hunt a variety of game on all types of terrain. So, he selected dogs with high strength and endurance, talented noses, water-repellent coats, and cooperative natures. The result was a robust dog that had all the characteristics of an exceptional pointer and retriever.\n\nKorthals continued his breeding program when he moved to Germany, and eventually France. The breed standard was established in 1886, and the Wirehaired Pointing Griffon quickly gained popularity throughout Europe. The breed earned AKC recognition in 1887, though it was mistakenly labeled a Russian Setter. Today, most Wirehaired Pointing Griffons are still bred in France."

The outer coat is straight and wiry with a harsh texture that protects the breed when hunting in rough terrain. The undercoat is thick, insulating, and water-repellent.\n\nWirehaired Pointing Griffons come in steel gray with brown markings—which vary from shades of chestnut to white and orange. Ticking and roan are also common."

        "traits_physical": {
          "en": "The Wirehaired Pointing Griffon is famous for its facial furnishings.

Avoid accidental overfeeding by measuring out meals. And reduce portions or restrict calories if your pup gains weight. Also, remember that giving too many treats can contribute to obesity. Treats should make up no more than 10% of a dog's calories."

But never use clippers on the body, or the wiry hair will grow back much fuzzier.\n\nBecause of their longer ears, Griffons may be more prone to ear infections. Inspect and clean ears routinely to prevent infections. You should also trim nails regularly to keep them at a short, tidy length. Nails that get too long can cause discomfort and lead to problems walking.\n\nFinally, maintaining good [dental hygiene]({%blogURL dog-dental-care%}) is essential for any dog's long-term health.

Adverse reactions can occur when affected dogs are exposed to some common drugs, however, all FDA approved heartworm preventatives are safe to administer to MDR1 positive dogs.

          "en": "Dogs that carry this mutation are asymptomatic until they are exposed to a medication that uses the pump that is rendered defective by the mutation in the MDR1 (also called ABCB1) gene. Drugs known to use this P-glycoprotein pump are macrocyclic lactones (antiparasitic drugs), loperamide (antidiarrheal), erythromycin (antibiotic), acepromazine (tranquilizer), butorphanol (opioid), and certain drugs used in cancer treatment (vincristine, vinblastine, and doxorubicin). When these medications are administered, they accumulate in the brain which results in the adverse reactions. Typical symptoms include tremors, loss of balance, seizures, obtundation, excessive salivation, dilated pupils, and bradycardia. If untreated, the condition may lead to respiratory arrest, coma or death. Because dogs with one copy of the mutation will have some P-glycoprotein function, the most severe cases tend to occur in dogs that have two copies of the mutation and therefore lack any functional P-glycoprotein pumps. However, the condition can still be very severe in dogs that have only one copy of the mutation.\n",
          "pt": "Os cães portadores desta mutação são assintomáticos até serem expostos a um medicamento que utiliza a bomba de glicoproteína-P que se torna defeituosa devido à mutação no gene MDR1 (também conhecido por ABCB1). Os medicamentos que utilizam esta bomba de glicoproteína-P são as lactonas macrocíclicas (antiparasitários), a loperamida (antidiarreico), a eritromicina (antibiótico), a acepromazina (tranquilizante), o butorfanol (opiáceo) e alguns medicamentos utilizados no tratamento do cancro (vincristina, vinblastina e doxorrubicina). Quando estes medicamentos são administrados, acumulam-se no cérebro, o que resulta em reações adversas. Os sinais típicos são tremores, perda de equilíbrio, convulsões, obtundação, excesso de salivação, pupilas dilatadas e bradicardia. Se não for tratada, a doença pode conduzir a uma paragem respiratória, coma ou morte. Os cães com uma cópia da mutação apresentam alguma função da glicoproteína-P, sendo que os casos mais graves se detetam em cães com duas cópias da mutação e que por carecem de bombas da glicoproteína-P funcionais. No entanto, mesmo nos cães que tenham apenas uma cópia da mutação, a doença pode ser igualmente grave."

For some breeds where the MDR1 mutation frequency is particular high, breeders may consider matings using dogs that have one or two copies of the MDR1 mutation to maintain genetic diversity within their breed. IMPORTANT: Resulting puppies must be tested for the MDR1 mutation to ensure safe future medical treatment. If a dog with one copy of the MDR1 mutation is bred with a clear dog with no copies of the MDR1 mutation, about half of the puppies will have one copy and half will have no copies of the MDR1 mutation.

Os criadores desta raça podem considerar o acasalamento com cães que tenham uma ou duas cópias da mutação MDR1 (em inglês) para manter a diversidade genética, nos casos em que a frequência da mutação MDR1 seja particularmente elevada. IMPORTANTE: Os cachorros que nasçam devem ser submetidos a testes de presença da mutação MDR1 para garantir um tratamento médico seguro no futuro. Se um cão com uma cópia da mutação MDR1 for cruzado com um cão sem cópias desta mutação, a ninhada que nascer terá perto de metade dos cachorros com uma cópia e outra metade sem qualquer cópia da mutação MDR1. Se um cão com duas cópias da mutação MDR1 for cruzado com um cão sem cópias da mutação, toda a ninhada terá uma cópia da mutação.
