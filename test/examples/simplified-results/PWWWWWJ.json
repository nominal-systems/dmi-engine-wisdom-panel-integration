The Basques, who lived in the borderlands between France and Spain, relied on Pyrenean Shepherds to work alongside their herds. In the 1800s, the Basques began migrating to Australia to keep sheep. Their Pyrenean Shepherds crossbred with other working dogs, including Collies and Border Collies, creating the modern version of the Australian Shepherd.\n\nThe Basques later immigrated to the United States (with their dogs in tow), and the breed became known as the Australian Shepherd. These fearless herding dogs fast became popular for their skill and stamina. They took their place as an iconic part of “cowboy culture” in the American West and still work on ranches and as rodeo performers."},"facts":{"en":"The Australian Shepherd is an intelligent, driven working dog with strong herding and guarding instincts. These high-energy, athletic dogs also make loving, affectionate companions for active families."},"traits_appearance":{"en":"The Australian Shepherd is a medium-sized dog with a solid build, well-balanced proportions, and a smooth, free gait. Males are masculine without coarseness, and females are feminine but not slight of bone."},"traits_coat_and_coloring":{"en":"Australian Shepherds are a double-coated breed with a unique trait: The undercoat varies in quantity with variations in climate. Their outercoats are of medium length and texture, and straight to wavy in appearance. The hair is short and smooth on their heads, ears, front of forelegs, and below the hocks while the backs of the forelegs and britches have moderate feathering. Australian Shepherds have moderate manes and frills that are more pronounced in males.\n\nThe breed comes in several coat colors: black, blue merle, red merle, red (all red or red with or without white markings, and/or tan points). There may be white on the neck, chest, legs, muzzle underparts, and blaze on the head. Australian Shepherds with blue merle or red merle coloring tend to become darker with age."},"traits_physical":{"en":"Australian Shepherds have solid, muscular bodies with straight, strong backs and deep chests with well-sprung ribs. Their almond-shaped eyes may be brown, blue, amber, or other variations or combinations of these colors—and often include flecks and marbling. Their ears are moderate size, triangular-shaped, and set high on the head. Australian Shepherds have naturally bobbed tails."},"temperament":{"en":"Although Australian Shepherds are serious about their work, the breed is known for having an even disposition. These are good-natured dogs that are seldom quarrelsome. Their intelligence, exuberance, and playful personalities make Australian Shepherds excellent companions.\n\nAustralian Shepherds are not the right fit for all families. Their strong herding tendencies could lead them to chase cars, corral children, or herd other pets.

If there are no sheep or cattle to herd, these dogs will require lots of exercise. Aussies make great running companions and enjoy brisk walks, hiking, swimming, and trips to the dog park. These highly intelligent dogs also excel in dog sports such as agility, obedience, rally, dock diving, and—of course—herding.\n\nWithout adequate exercise, Australian Shepherds can become bored and destructive. Mental stimulation is essential, too. Provide Australian Shepherds with puzzle toys to help keep their minds engaged."},"care_training":{"en":"Training is a must for this breed. Australian Shepherds are intelligent and keen to learn new things, which makes them excellent students.

Thought to be a descendant of the now-extinct \"St. John's Water Dog,\" they were trained to retrieve fishing nets from the icy waters of the North Atlantic. The breed's dense coat and strong swimming abilities made it ideally suited for this job.\n\nThese dogs—known at the time as simply the \"Lesser Newfoundland\"—eventually died out in the area. But before that happened, English fishermen brought the breed to England in the 19th century. There, they were lauded for their swimming, retrieving, and hunting skills. It's believed that the Labrador Retriever got its name from the Earl of Malmesbury. He fell in love with the dogs and coined the name \"Labrador\" or \"Lab\" to differentiate them from their Newfoundland ancestors.\n\nEnglish breeders refined the breed during the second half of the 19th century and are responsible for the Labrador Retrievers that we know and love today. A relatively new breed, the Labrador Retriever was recognized by the English Kennel Club in 1903, and the AKC in 1917.\n\nToday, Labrador Retrievers are beloved family dogs that enjoy agility, hunting, tracking, competitive obedience, and swimming. Labs are also commonly used as working dogs—employed as guide dogs, assistance dogs, search and rescue dogs, and contraband detection dogs."},"facts":{"en":"Labrador Retrievers are well-known for their outgoing, family-friendly personalities. Happy to work hard or play hard, these adaptable, good-natured dogs have earned their place as one of the world's most popular breeds."},"traits_appearance":{"en":"Labradors are strongly built dogs with short coupling (meaning, the space between their last rib and their pelvis is relatively short). They have broad skulls and are broad and deep through their chest and ribs."},"traits_coat_and_coloring":{"en":"The coat of the Labrador Retriever is short and dense, without any wave or feathering. Labs also possess a weather-resistance undercoat that protects them from water and cold temperatures.\n\nLabrador Retrievers come in solid black, chocolate, or yellow. The yellow varies from a pale cream to a rich red fox color. Some Labradors also have white chest blazes.\n\nLabradors typically have black or brown noses. In some yellow Labs, the nose color may fade to a lighter or dull pink color, known as a Dudley nose, as the dog ages."},"traits_physical":{"en":"Signature to Labrador Retrievers are a weather-resistant coat, drop ears, distinctive tails, and friendly, expressive eyes. Labrador Retrievers also have a unique tail that is very thick at the base and gradually tapers toward the tip. Its rounded appearance is sometimes described as an \"otter tail.\""},"temperament":{"en":"The Labrador Retriever is one of the best breeds for families and can be an excellent breed for even an inexperienced dog owner. Known for their happy-go-lucky, easy-going personalities, these dogs are always up for adventure. They like to be included in all aspects of family life.\n\nVery social dogs, Labrador Retrievers bond easily with people, as well as other dogs and pets. They are patient, affectionate, and trustworthy around children, making them excellent playmates and a welcome addition to most any family.\n\nThough generally calm and good-natured, some Labrador Retrievers can be quite energetic. They are well-suited for an active lifestyle filled with outdoor activities such as hiking and swimming."},"care_nutrition":{"en":"Labrador Retrievers need a high-quality, age-appropriate dog food. They will benefit from diets that are formulated for large-breed dogs. In particular, large-breed puppy diets prevent them from growing too fast, which can help protect them from hip dysplasia in adulthood.\n\nLabrador Retrievers have big appetites and, left to their own devices, will actively seek out human food and snacks. For this reason, they are prone to becoming overweight or obese. To keep their weight in a healthy range, their food intake—including treats—should be closely monitored."},"care_grooming":{"en":"To maintain a healthy coat, Labrador Retrievers should be brushed weekly (or more often during seasonal shedding periods).

They enjoy daily walks and opportunities to run or swim.\n\nBecause they are retrievers by nature, Labs also love to play fetch and are often happiest when chasing after a ball or frisbee. If a Labrador doesn't get enough exercise, they can be prone to destructive behaviors, such as chewing or digging.\n\nFinally, it's important to give Labrador Retrievers plenty of mental exercise. This can include giving them puzzle toys or [practicing obedience commands]({%blogURL dog-obedience-training%}) with them."},"care_training":{"en":"Labrador Retrievers are intelligent and eager to please—a combination that makes them a relatively easy breed to train. They are also highly motivated by food, which can be used to your advantage. Simply offer a small treat as a reward for desired behaviors, such as dropping an object or responding to \"come,\" \"sit,\" and other commands.\n\nLabradors have the tendency to pull while on leash.

They crossed various terriers and bulldogs, and the resulting dogs made their way to the United States in the late 1800s.\n\nThough originally used for dogfighting, these early pit dogs had a gentle, hard-working nature. As a result, the breed quickly gained a loyal following, and farmers began employing the dogs as herders, guardians, hunters, and companions.\n\nThe United Kennel Club was the first club to recognize the American Pit Bull Terrier in 1898. (Fun fact: The UKC founder’s own dog was the first to be registered.) And the American Dog Breeders Association accepted the APBT in 1909. APBTs have since appeared in TV shows, advertising, and even propaganda posters for the two World Wars. Today, this popular breed serves as a working dog, therapy dog, and devoted family companion.\n\nThe American Kennel Club was reluctant to register a breed once associated with dog fighting, which led to the creation of the related (but distinct) [American Staffordshire Terrier]({%breedURL american-staffordshire-terrier%}), originally called the Staffordshire Terrier, in 1936"},"facts":{"en":"American Pit Bull Terriers are courageous, athletic dogs known for their loyalty and love of children.

They form strong bonds with their people and are loving and protective around children. But such a friendly nature—even towards strangers—often makes them ill-suited as guard dogs.\n\nAPBTs are happiest when with their family.

German Shepherds were used as German police and military dogs during World Wars I and II. They were also very good at locating wounded soldiers, and Allied soldiers took notice. Some soldiers introduced the breed to their home countries, and the popularity of the German Shepherd took off around the world.\n\nThe German Shepherd was recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1908. From 1925-1936, it was the most popular dog breed in the U.S. Though it eventually lost this title, it remains one of the most well-known and popular breeds.\n\nToday, German Shepherds are just as likely to be loving, protective family dogs as they are working military or police dogs."},"facts":{"en":"German Shepherds are good-natured, all-purpose workers.

Both varieties have an undercoat. The double coat is dense and close-fitting. It is typically short on the head and front legs, and longer on the neck and hind legs.\n\nThe long and harsh outer coat is long and soft, with tufts on the ears and legs. This creates a bushy tail and \"trousers.\" Longer hair on the neck almost gives the appearance of a mane.\n\nGerman Shepherds are generally a combination of black and tan, though more or less black may be seen. There is also a gray variant, where the tip of the hair is black, and the rest is tan. A black mask and saddle are common traits in this breed.\n\nThough not recognized by the AKC, all-white German Shepherd Dogs do exist under a separate breed name. And diluted color variants can occur in the German Shepherd, but they are considered faults under AKC's standards."},"traits_physical":{"en":"The German Shepherd has erect, medium-size ears that are carried upright.

They enjoy receiving lots of attention and companionship from their people, and love being included in family activities.\n\nGerman Shepherds are generally friendly towards children as long as they're not treated harshly. At times, they can become over-protective and unsure of or standoffish with strangers. [Socializing them early]({%blogURL puppy-socialization%}) can help them be more accepting of new people.\n\nIntelligence and alertness are common personality traits of German Shepherds.

She grew fond of Collies during her frequent visits to Balmoral Castle in the Scottish Highlands. And in the late 1800s, she publicly advocated for the herding breed, helping it earn worldwide recognition.\n\nOver the years, Collies acted as guide dogs, water rescue dogs, and movie stars—in addition to herding dogs—thanks to their strong work ethic and incredible skill.

Experts think the breed began with the Chukchi tribe of Siberia. When weather changes forced this semi-nomadic tribe to expand their hunting grounds, they needed a dog that could pull light loads long distances in sub-zero temperatures—without expending a lot of energy. The Siberian Husky was the result of those breeding efforts.\n\nIn addition to pulling sleds, the Siberian Husky has been given several jobs throughout history. These include herding reindeer, keeping children warm, and working as search and rescue dogs during World War II.\n\nSiberian Huskies became famous in 1925 when they traveled 658 miles in less than six days to deliver diphtheria serum after the city of Nome, Alaska, was stricken by an epidemic. The Iditarod dog sled race commemorates this feat. Huskies also transported various other medications to the ill.\n\nThe Siberian Husky came to America in 1909, and the popularity of the breed has grown significantly ever since. It's now one of the most popular Arctic breeds.\n\nThe AKC did not recognize the Siberian Husky until 1930—the same year the Soviet government stopped the exportation of the breed by closing the borders of Siberia to external trade."},"facts":{"en":"The Siberian Husky is a very intelligent breed that's active, alert, and gentle.

And if it's cold and snowy outside, all the better!\n\nThis breed is typically good-natured and social towards other dogs but can be unpredictable with smaller pets. Huskies do also have the tendency to chase wildlife and, given the chance, would roam for hours. For these reasons, they should be in a fenced yard or on a leash when outdoors."},"care_nutrition":{"en":"To meet their nutritional needs, you should feed Siberian Huskies a high-quality food that's appropriate for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, or senior).\n\nFor the working Siberian Husky, you should adjust diets seasonally: increase protein during the winter months when they're pulling sleds, and decrease it in the summer when they're not as active.\n\nBecause of their thick coats, it can be difficult to visually assess a Siberian Husky's body condition. To get a more accurate understanding, use your hands to feel along their rib cage. When at an appropriate weight, you should be able to easily feel the ribs. If you notice any weight gain, restrict calories until they return to an ideal weight."},"care_grooming":{"en":"Siberian Huskies are naturally clean dogs that don't require frequent bathing.

You can trim fur around the feet and toes to keep paws clean and tidy, but no other fur on the body should be trimmed.\n\nA Siberian Husky's nails need to be cut regularly. Nails that get overly long can cause pain and potentially lead to problems running or walking.\n\nLike all dog breeds, Siberian Huskies require regular [dental care]({%blogURL dog-dental-care%}), including at-home teeth brushing and professional dental cleanings. Maintaining good dental hygiene is important for their overall long-term health, and the sooner you get them into a good dental care routine, the better."},"care_exercise":{"en":"To be happy, Siberian Huskies need lots of attention and physical exercise.

However, the British expression \"chow chow\" (describing odds and ends transported on cargo ships) could have also been the inspiration for the breed's name.\n\nThroughout history, Chow Chows have been faithful companions to nobility in China and elsewhere. For example, Queen Victoria of England received the breed as a gift in 1865.

They alert their people to a stranger's arrival, but Eskies are never aggressive or threatening. The breed can be vocal and might not be the best option for apartment life.\n\nDue to their quick, curious natures, Eskies need a lot of exercise and mental stimulation. A quick walk around the block is not enough to satisfy their desire to explore. Providing American Eskimo Dogs with a fenced yard to roam and lots of different toys to play with can help channel their energy in positive directions.

Because dogs with one copy of the mutation will have some P-glycoprotein function, the most severe cases tend to occur in dogs that have two copies of the mutation and therefore lack any functional P-glycoprotein pumps. However, the condition can still be very severe in dogs that have only one copy of the mutation.\n"},"next_steps":{"en":"For dogs with copies of the MDR1 mutation it is important to be aware of medications which may result in an adverse reaction. These include: Acepromazine, Butorphanol, Doxorubicin, Doramectin, Emodepside, Erythromycin, Ivermectin, Loperamide, Milbemycin, Moxidectin, Paclitaxel, Rifampin, Selamectin, Vinblastine, Vincristine. It is best to explore alternative medications that will not use this P-glycoprotein pump or, at minimum, consider reduction of the dose to levels safe for an MDR1 positive dog.\n"},"breeder_advice_disease_specific":{"en":"This disease is autosomal dominant meaning that one copy of the mutation is needed for signs of this disorder to occur.  For some breeds where the MDR1 mutation frequency is particular high, breeders may consider matings using dogs that have one or two copies of the MDR1 mutation to maintain genetic diversity within their breed. IMPORTANT: Resulting puppies must be tested for the MDR1 mutation to ensure safe future medical treatment. If a dog with one copy of the MDR1 mutation is bred with a clear dog with no copies of the MDR1 mutation, about half of the puppies will have one copy and half will have no copies of the MDR1 mutation. If a dog with two copies of the MDR1 mutation is bred with a clear dog, the resulting puppies will all have one copy of the mutation. Please note: It is possible that disease signs similar to the ones caused by the MDR1 mutation could develop due to a different genetic or clinical cause."},"video_link_title":null,"article_link_title":null,"references":{"en":"Mealey, K.
