It didn't appear on the scene until the 18th century, much later than ancient breeds developed centuries earlier. In fact, it's not a sheepdog at all—it's a drover that moved cattle from pasture to market.\n\nThe breed may have originated in Devon and Somerset, but their bloodlines also include Scotch, European, and Russian descent.\n\nDespite the misleading moniker, the Old English Sheepdog has captured hearts and as well as the title roles in movies like The Shaggy Dog and The Shaggy D.A."},"facts":{"en":"Old English Sheepdogs are adaptable, gentle, and smart. Despite their large size, these big balls of fluff are active and agile, and their good looks are sure to draw attention."},"traits_appearance":{"en":"Old English Sheepdogs are muscular and compact with profuse coats. These big dogs are surefooted and agile and move with a gait similar to a shuffling bear."},"traits_coat_and_coloring":{"en":"Old English Sheepdogs are known for their coats. Their double coats include waterproof undercoats and outer coats with profuse, shaggy (never straight or curly) hair.\n\nSoft, flat coats are considered a fault for the breed. Hard-textured hair covers their skulls, necks, forelegs, and hocks.\n\nOld English Sheepdogs come in shades of gray, grizzle, blue, or blue merle with or without white markings. The breed standard for Old English Sheepdogs doesn't permit shades of brown or fawn in the coat."},"traits_physical":{"en":"Old English Sheepdogs are thickset, muscular working dogs with short, compact bodies and long, arched necks. They have muscular hindquarters and small feet with thick, hard pads. Their eyes may be brown, blue, or one of each, and convey an intelligent expression."},"temperament":{"en":"Old English Sheepdogs are even-tempered, good-natured, and adaptable, making them well-suited to all kinds of families and living situations.\n\nThis one-time working breed does not need a job to feel fulfilled. Rather, Old English Sheepdogs can feel content lounging around the house, going for walks, and hanging out with their families. Thanks to their patient and kind natures, Old English Sheepdogs make great companions for children.\n\nThe Old English Sheepdog is an excellent watchdog. Always alert, they will let out a big bark if something seems amiss."},"care_nutrition":{"en":"Feed Old English Sheepdogs a high-quality dog food that is appropriate for their life stage (puppy, adult, senior). Portion out their food with a measuring cup and limit treats to no more than 10 percent of their daily calories to prevent overfeeding."},"care_grooming":{"en":"It takes a lot of maintenance to keep Old English Sheepdogs looking their best. The double-coated breed needs thorough grooming at least once a week to remove dead hair and prevent mats and tangles.\n\nSome pet parents may take their Old English Sheepdog to the groomer for a “puppy cut” to keep their hair short, but even dogs with shorter coats require regular brushing and bathing.\n\nOld English Sheepdogs also require regular ear cleanings, nail trims, and a [dental care]({%blogURL dog-dental-care%}) routine, including at-home teeth brushing and professional cleanings. Start these grooming essentials when Old English Sheepdogs are puppies to ensure they are part of your routine."},"care_exercise":{"en":"Old English Sheepdogs are a moderately active breed.

And no one really knows the full story behind the breed's origins. Poodles are likely related to the [Portguese Water Dog]({%breedURL portuguese-water-dog%}) and [Irish Water Spaniel]({%breedURL irish-water-spaniel%}). Some experts believe they originated in Central Europe or Russia, while others think they got their start in Spain or Portugal. Another common theory is that German soldiers brought the Poodle to France during the 1400s.\n\nRegardless of the breed's exact beginnings, everyone agrees that Poodles were bred for bird hunting and water retrieval. And their love of water is how they got their name. \"Poodle\" comes from an old German word meaning \"to splash about.\"\n\nWhat's the deal with the famous Poodle haircut? Hunters knew that Poodles would be more efficient swimmers if they had less hair. But less hair would leave them more vulnerable to the cold water. So, creative Poodle owners had an idea. They shaved most of the dog's body but strategically left puffs of hair to protect joints and vital organs from the cold. Problem solved.\n\nIn the 1700s, Standard Poodles were bred down to smaller sizes. Today, the Standard Poodle, [Medium Poodle]({%breedURL poodle-medium%}), [Miniature Poodle]({%breedURL poodle-miniature%}), and [Toy Poodle]({%breedURL poodle-toy%}) all share the same breed standard."},"facts":{"en":"The Standard Poodle is a calm, smart, sensitive breed that makes a great jogging buddy, family dog, and (if properly coiffed) fashion statement. Standard Poodles were so popular that breeders ultimately created the Medium, Miniature, and Toy Poodle varieties."},"traits_appearance":{"en":"The Standard Poodle is an elegant, well-proportioned breed with a frizzy and curly coat."},"traits_coat_and_coloring":{"en":"The Standard Poodle's dense coat can be curly (frizzy curls over the whole body) or corded (even cords that hang in varying lengths). Poodle owners often give their pups stylized haircuts or a \"puppy clip\" that trims hair to an even length over the whole body.\n\nPoodles come in a wide range of colors—including solid blacks, grays, silvers, browns, apricots, creams, and shading variations."},"traits_physical":{"en":"The Standard Poodle has dark, oval-shaped eyes that offer an alert, intelligent expression. Covered in long, wavy hair, the ears are long enough to reach the corner of the lip when pulled forward."},"temperament":{"en":"The Standard Poodle is an incredibly smart, playful, and—to the surprise of many—athletic breed. Typically friendly, Poodles get along well with kids, dogs, and other pets.\n\nStandard Poodles love people and form tight bonds with their families. And because of their sensitive nature, they even pick up on the moods of people they're close to. This intuitive nature—combined with a willingness to please—makes the Poodle a great assistance and therapy dog.\n\nPoodles may bark, and some are reserved around strangers. But [early socialization]({%blogURL puppy-socialization%}) can help prevent these and other undesirable behaviors."},"care_nutrition":{"en":"Standard Poodles need a dog food formulated for their specific life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior). Diets developed specifically for Poodles are a great option to explore.\n\nTo prevent your Poodle from becoming overweight, keep an eye on their food portions. And be sure to take treats into account when tracking their daily calorie intake. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of a dog's calories."},"care_grooming":{"en":"Standard Poodles have hair instead of fur. That means—unlike fur coats that grow to a point and then shed—a Poodle's hair keeps growing. Similar to human hair, this breed's hair does still fall out. But it usually falls back into their coats (instead of all over the house). Because of this minimal shedding, Poodles are an excellent breed for people with allergies.\n\nThough Standard Poodles don't shed a lot, their coats still need regular grooming. To keep their hair free from mats and tangles, brush a few times a week. And because their hair grows continuously, plan on haircuts every month or so.\n\nIn addition to professional dental cleanings, Standard Poodles need an at-home dental care routine that includes regular teeth brushing.\n\nMaintaining good [dental hygiene]({%blogURL dog-dental-care%}) is essential for the overall long-term health of all dogs."},"care_exercise":{"en":"A very active breed, the Standard Poodle enjoys all the same activities as other dogs in the sporting group. Long walks, jogs, agility, retrieving, rally, and swimming are fun ways for a Poodle to burn off energy. Or for something a little different, try musical canine freestyle—a mix of obedience training, dance, and tricks."},"care_training":{"en":"Standard Poodles are very bright dogs, and therefore easy to train.

Affected dogs are slower to eliminate these drugs from the body and can suffer side effects when exposed to certain medications. This condition is sometimes called \"ivermectin sensitivity.\" However, the name is a misnomer as several other drugs pose a risk to MDR1 positive dogs. Adverse reactions can occur when affected dogs are exposed to some common drugs, however, all FDA approved heartworm preventatives are safe to administer to MDR1 positive dogs. This mutation is inherited in a dominant fashion though dogs with two copies of the mutation will exhibit more severe clinical signs.\n"},"clinical_description":{"en":"Dogs that carry this mutation are asymptomatic until they are exposed to a medication that uses the pump that is rendered defective by the mutation in the MDR1 (also called ABCB1) gene. Drugs known to use this P-glycoprotein pump are macrocyclic lactones (antiparasitic drugs), loperamide (antidiarrheal), erythromycin (antibiotic), acepromazine (tranquilizer), butorphanol (opioid), and certain drugs used in cancer treatment (vincristine, vinblastine, and doxorubicin). When these medications are administered, they accumulate in the brain which results in the adverse reactions. Typical symptoms include tremors, loss of balance, seizures, obtundation, excessive salivation, dilated pupils, and bradycardia. If untreated, the condition may lead to respiratory arrest, coma or death. Because dogs with one copy of the mutation will have some P-glycoprotein function, the most severe cases tend to occur in dogs that have two copies of the mutation and therefore lack any functional P-glycoprotein pumps. However, the condition can still be very severe in dogs that have only one copy of the mutation.\n"},"next_steps":{"en":"For dogs with copies of the MDR1 mutation it is important to be aware of medications which may result in an adverse reaction. These include: Acepromazine, Butorphanol, Doxorubicin, Doramectin, Emodepside, Erythromycin, Ivermectin, Loperamide, Milbemycin, Moxidectin, Paclitaxel, Rifampin, Selamectin, Vinblastine, Vincristine. It is best to explore alternative medications that will not use this P-glycoprotein pump or, at minimum, consider reduction of the dose to levels safe for an MDR1 positive dog.\n"},"breeder_advice_disease_specific":{"en":"This disease is autosomal dominant meaning that one copy of the mutation is needed for signs of this disorder to occur.  For some breeds where the MDR1 mutation frequency is particular high, breeders may consider matings using dogs that have one or two copies of the MDR1 mutation to maintain genetic diversity within their breed. IMPORTANT: Resulting puppies must be tested for the MDR1 mutation to ensure safe future medical treatment. If a dog with one copy of the MDR1 mutation is bred with a clear dog with no copies of the MDR1 mutation, about half of the puppies will have one copy and half will have no copies of the MDR1 mutation. If a dog with two copies of the MDR1 mutation is bred with a clear dog, the resulting puppies will all have one copy of the mutation.

CLAD type III is characterized by immunodeficiency predisposing affected dogs to recurrent severe infections.\n"},"clinical_description":{"en":"CLAD III results from leukocytes being unable to migrate to the site of inflammation and participate in the phagocytosis of pathogens due to impaired activation of beta integrins. Persistent leukocytosis (increased number of leukocytes in the blood) and platelet dysfunction are characteristic for the disorder. The typical onset of clinical signs is at the age of 6 months. Clinical signs include fever (pyrexia), increased mucosal hemorrhages, marked periodontal disease, poor wound healing, and lameness.\n"},"next_steps":{"en":"Therapy is targeted at treating secondary infections, preventing bleeding episodes, and supportive care.

A carrier dog with one copy of the CLAD mutation can be safely bred with a clear dog with no copies of the CLAD mutation. About half of the puppies will have one copy (carriers) and half will have no copies of the CLAD mutation. Puppies in a litter which is expected to contain carriers should be tested prior to breeding. Carrier to carrier matings are not advised as the resulting litter may contain affected puppies. Please note: It is possible that disease signs similar to the ones caused by the CLAD mutation could develop due to a different genetic or clinical cause."},"video_link_title":null,"article_link_title":null,"references":{"en":"Hugo, T.
