The breed traces its origins to the Border Collie, which breeders then crossed with smaller longhaired breeds to create a small dog to herd sheep, ponies, and chickens.\n\nShetland Sheepdogs worked on local farms, called “toons,” leading to the slang nickname Toonie Dog. Their small size proved to be a significant benefit: The diminutive dogs ate less than larger breeds, an essential trait on a remote island where food was scarce.\n\nTheir geographic isolation meant that Shetland Sheepdogs, also known as Shelties, lived in isolation.\n\nShelties remained virtually unknown outside of the Shetland Islands until the early 1900s. Recognized as the Shetland Collie when the breed gained admission to the Kennel Club in England in 1909, the breed soon became named the Shetland Sheepdog."},"facts":{"en":"The Shetland Sheepdog is a small, alert, working dog. Though it bears a striking resemblance to the rough-coated Collie, this is a breed all its own, prized for its intelligent, obedient, and affectionate nature."},"traits_appearance":{"en":"Shetland Sheepdogs are small, longhaired dogs that move with effortless speed and a trotting gait and appear to have alert, gentle, intelligent expressions."},"traits_coat_and_coloring":{"en":"Shetland Sheepdogs have double coats: their short undercoats are so dense that it causes the outer coat to “stand off” of their bodies; the outer coat is long, straight hair with a harsh texture. A smooth coat is considered a serious fault.\n\nShetland Sheepdogs have smooth hair on their faces, tips of their ears, and feet, and abundant hair on their mane and frill, which are more pronounced in males. The breed standard allows excess hair on ears, feet, and on hocks to be trimmed for the show ring.\n\nThe breed comes in three colors: black, blue merle, and sable (with colors ranging from light golden through mahogany) and marked with varying white or tan."},"traits_physical":{"en":"These are small dogs with muscular backs, deep chests, and broad, strong thighs. Their tails are long and carried straight down or in a slight upward curve at rest.\n\nShelties have well-rounded muzzles; small ears set high and carried three-quarters erect; and almond-shaped dark eyes (with blue or merle eyes allowed in dogs with blue merle coloring)."},"temperament":{"en":"Shetland Sheepdogs are loyal, affectionate family pets. Shelties will adapt to life in the city as long as they get regular exercise. Their herding instincts could lead Shetland Sheepdogs to chase moving cars or other animals, so a fenced yard is a good idea.\n\nTheir tendency to bark may not endear Shetland Sheepdogs to the neighbors, but the breed does make an excellent watchdog."},"care_nutrition":{"en":"Feed Shetland Sheepdogs a high-quality dog food appropriate for their life stage (puppy, adult, senior). Portion out their food with a measuring cup and limit treats to no more than 10 percent of their daily calories to prevent overfeeding."},"care_grooming":{"en":"Shetland Sheepdogs need regular attention to keep their hair free of mats, tangles, and debris. Weekly brushing with a pin brush will remove dead undercoat and keep their coats looking sleek. Pay special attention to the areas around the ears, under the elbows on each front leg, and the “pants” under the tail, which are more prone to matting.\n\nShetland Sheepdogs require almost-daily grooming during shedding season to remove dead hair and keep up with excess shedding. Their coats protect against the elements, so shaving their coats is not recommended.\n\nShetland Sheepdogs benefit from a regular [dental care]({%blogURL dog-dental-care%}) routine that includes at-home teeth brushing and professional cleanings. Start these grooming practices when Shetland Sheepdogs are puppies to ensure they become a habit."},"care_exercise":{"en":"Like other herding breeds, Shetland Sheepdogs require moderate amounts of exercise to be happy and healthy.\n\nIn addition to walks, hikes, and trips to the dog park, Shetland Sheepdogs also enjoy dog sports such as obedience competitions, agility, tracking, herding, and other activities that allow the breed to show off speed and stamina and spend time with their owners.\n\nMental stimulation is important, too. Provide puzzle toys or engage Shetland Sheepdogs in games like fetch or hide and seek to engage their minds and their bodies."},"care_training":{"en":"Shelties are intelligent, eager to please, and trainable. With positive reinforcement and rewards, Shetland Sheepdogs can master basic commands and learn new tricks. Consistent training can also help teach these vocal dogs to stop barking.\n\n[Early socialization]({%blogURL puppy-socialization%}) can help make Shetland Sheepdogs feel more comfortable with strangers."},"care_health":null,"published_at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","country_codes":["US","GB"],"ancestry_version_ids":["a726d077-0886-57b4-81d5-01362be36a09","b5bb33f8-400e-43f7-a48f-d6dfdcb8a6fa","ff9d3dfa-fad7-449e-bb69-ad820473897c"]}}],"ideal_weight_result":{"id":"697c6a79-e052-4aa4-87ae-ff4490d7641d","result_set_id":"ee4d11da-5257-405f-a6e2-0b9ea1317387","female_pred_size":9.8,"female_min_size":7.3,"female_max_size":12.7,"male_pred_size":10.4,"male_min_size":7.7,"male_max_size":13.2,"spayed_pred_size":10.1,"spayed_min_size":7.3,"spayed_max_size":13.6,"neutered_pred_size":10.8,"neutered_min_size":8.2,"neutered_max_size":14.5,"created_at":"2024-04-16T21:35:38.973Z","updated_at":"2024-04-16T21:35:38.973Z"},"notable_and_at_risk_health_test_results":[{"id":"12275bfe-14ca-4bf0-8656-142d04ad1118","health_result_id":"ec30b9f4-03d3-4c6e-802e-297b974fdb54","health_test_id":"11eb1d26-7603-596b-a00c-e697076b5bb8","copies":1,"result_male":"at-risk","result_female":"at-risk","created_at":"2024-04-16T21:35:39.002Z","updated_at":"2024-04-16T21:35:39.002Z","health_test":{"id":"11eb1d26-7603-596b-a00c-e697076b5bb8","test_name":"025_MDR1","slug":"mdr1","onset_age":1,"likelihood":5,"disease_severity":3,"mode_of_inheritance":"autosomal dominant","gene":"MDR1/ABCB1","typical_allele":"I","variant_allele":"D","chromosome":"14","coordinate_start":13726599,"coordinate_end":13726596,"show_technical_details":true,"locus_name":"MDR1","disease_category":"Drug response","version":null,"excluded_region":null,"licensed_regions":null,"enabled":true,"enabled_v3":true,"enabled_product_versions":"WH,RC,BFMX","content_status":null,"frequency_one_or_more":0.02009799,"pmid":null,"video_link":null,"article_link":null,"created_at":"2020-05-15T20:39:59.049Z","updated_at":"2024-02-29T22:52:13.240Z","species":"dog","category":"complication","locales":["US","UK"],"disease_name":{"en":"MDR1 Medication Sensitivity"},"disease_long_name":{"en":"Multidrug Resistance 1, (MDR1)"},"disease_short_name":{"en":"MDR1"},"what_is_the_disease":{"en":"The MDR1 gene mutation causes a defect to a drug pumping protein that plays an important role in limiting drug absorption and distribution (particularly to the brain).

Affected dogs are slower to eliminate these drugs from the body and can suffer side effects when exposed to certain medications. This condition is sometimes called \"ivermectin sensitivity.\" However, the name is a misnomer as several other drugs pose a risk to MDR1 positive dogs. Adverse reactions can occur when affected dogs are exposed to some common drugs, however, all FDA approved heartworm preventatives are safe to administer to MDR1 positive dogs. This mutation is inherited in a dominant fashion though dogs with two copies of the mutation will exhibit more severe clinical signs.\n"},"clinical_description":{"en":"Dogs that carry this mutation are asymptomatic until they are exposed to a medication that uses the pump that is rendered defective by the mutation in the MDR1 (also called ABCB1) gene. Drugs known to use this P-glycoprotein pump are macrocyclic lactones (antiparasitic drugs), loperamide (antidiarrheal), erythromycin (antibiotic), acepromazine (tranquilizer), butorphanol (opioid), and certain drugs used in cancer treatment (vincristine, vinblastine, and doxorubicin). When these medications are administered, they accumulate in the brain which results in the adverse reactions. Typical symptoms include tremors, loss of balance, seizures, obtundation, excessive salivation, dilated pupils, and bradycardia. If untreated, the condition may lead to respiratory arrest, coma or death. Because dogs with one copy of the mutation will have some P-glycoprotein function, the most severe cases tend to occur in dogs that have two copies of the mutation and therefore lack any functional P-glycoprotein pumps. However, the condition can still be very severe in dogs that have only one copy of the mutation.\n"},"next_steps":{"en":"For dogs with copies of the MDR1 mutation it is important to be aware of medications which may result in an adverse reaction. These include: Acepromazine, Butorphanol, Doxorubicin, Doramectin, Emodepside, Erythromycin, Ivermectin, Loperamide, Milbemycin, Moxidectin, Paclitaxel, Rifampin, Selamectin, Vinblastine, Vincristine. It is best to explore alternative medications that will not use this P-glycoprotein pump or, at minimum, consider reduction of the dose to levels safe for an MDR1 positive dog.\n"},"breeder_advice_disease_specific":{"en":"This disease is autosomal dominant meaning that one copy of the mutation is needed for signs of this disorder to occur.  For some breeds where the MDR1 mutation frequency is particular high, breeders may consider matings using dogs that have one or two copies of the MDR1 mutation to maintain genetic diversity within their breed. IMPORTANT: Resulting puppies must be tested for the MDR1 mutation to ensure safe future medical treatment. If a dog with one copy of the MDR1 mutation is bred with a clear dog with no copies of the MDR1 mutation, about half of the puppies will have one copy and half will have no copies of the MDR1 mutation. If a dog with two copies of the MDR1 mutation is bred with a clear dog, the resulting puppies will all have one copy of the mutation. Please note: It is possible that disease signs similar to the ones caused by the MDR1 mutation could develop due to a different genetic or clinical cause."},"video_link_title":null,"article_link_title":null,"references":{"en":"Mealey, K.
