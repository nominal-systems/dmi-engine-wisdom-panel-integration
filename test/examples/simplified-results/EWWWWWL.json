And like all springers, the Welsh Springer Spaniel was bred to locate and flush out (or \"spring\") game from the bushes.\n\nBecause they worked in rough terrain and extreme weather, Springer Spaniels needed to be sturdy, agile dogs with great stamina and swimming ability. Breeders refined these traits during the Renaissance, and they are the standards still held today.\n\nPeople initially referred to the breed as the \"Welsh Spaniel\" or \"Welsh Cocker.\" When the dogs gained popularity in America in 1902, the breed earned its current \"Welsh Springer Spaniel\" name. But the owners who love them often call these dogs \"Welshies.\""},"facts":{"en":"The Welsh Springer Spaniel is an intelligent, energetic, and playful breed.

The red can vary slightly in hue, but it's generally deep and vibrant."},"traits_physical":{"en":"Welsh Springer Spaniels have slightly domed skulls and straight muzzles.

These good-natured, happy dogs are excellent with children and friendly towards other pets.\n\nWelsh Springers thrive on human companionship. However, they tend to be suspicious of people they don't know—perhaps because they prefer to reserve all their affection and devotion for their families!

For this reason, Welshies don't do well when left alone for long periods."},"care_nutrition":{"en":"Welsh Springer Spaniels require a high-quality dog food that is age-appropriate—whether it's commercially manufactured or homemade (with a veterinarian's supervision and approval).\n\nIt's important to monitor the amount of food you give your Welsh Springer Spaniel.

Adverse reactions can occur when affected dogs are exposed to some common drugs, however, all FDA approved heartworm preventatives are safe to administer to MDR1 positive dogs. This mutation is inherited in a dominant fashion though dogs with two copies of the mutation will exhibit more severe clinical signs.\n"},"clinical_description":{"en":"Dogs that carry this mutation are asymptomatic until they are exposed to a medication that uses the pump that is rendered defective by the mutation in the MDR1 (also called ABCB1) gene. Drugs known to use this P-glycoprotein pump are macrocyclic lactones (antiparasitic drugs), loperamide (antidiarrheal), erythromycin (antibiotic), acepromazine (tranquilizer), butorphanol (opioid), and certain drugs used in cancer treatment (vincristine, vinblastine, and doxorubicin). When these medications are administered, they accumulate in the brain which results in the adverse reactions. Typical symptoms include tremors, loss of balance, seizures, obtundation, excessive salivation, dilated pupils, and bradycardia. If untreated, the condition may lead to respiratory arrest, coma or death. Because dogs with one copy of the mutation will have some P-glycoprotein function, the most severe cases tend to occur in dogs that have two copies of the mutation and therefore lack any functional P-glycoprotein pumps. However, the condition can still be very severe in dogs that have only one copy of the mutation.\n"},"next_steps":{"en":"For dogs with copies of the MDR1 mutation it is important to be aware of medications which may result in an adverse reaction.

It is best to explore alternative medications that will not use this P-glycoprotein pump or, at minimum, consider reduction of the dose to levels safe for an MDR1 positive dog.\n"},"breeder_advice_disease_specific":{"en":"This disease is autosomal dominant meaning that one copy of the mutation is needed for signs of this disorder to occur.  For some breeds where the MDR1 mutation frequency is particular high, breeders may consider matings using dogs that have one or two copies of the MDR1 mutation to maintain genetic diversity within their breed. IMPORTANT: Resulting puppies must be tested for the MDR1 mutation to ensure safe future medical treatment. If a dog with one copy of the MDR1 mutation is bred with a clear dog with no copies of the MDR1 mutation, about half of the puppies will have one copy and half will have no copies of the MDR1 mutation. If a dog with two copies of the MDR1 mutation is bred with a clear dog, the resulting puppies will all have one copy of the mutation. Please note: It is possible that disease signs similar to the ones caused by the MDR1 mutation could develop due to a different genetic or clinical cause."},"video_link_title":null,"article_link_title":null,"references":{"en":"Mealey, K.
