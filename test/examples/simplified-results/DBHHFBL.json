The courageous and powerful dogs that resulted excelled in the fighting pit. But they also showed great talent as guard dogs and livestock herders.\n\nThese pit bulls came to America in the late 1800s. And though some were used for fighting, many became fixtures both on the frontier and at home—thanks to their hard-working, gentle nature. Still, most kennel clubs were hesitant to recognize dogs associated with fighting.\n\nThough the American Pit Bull Terrier received United Kennel Club recognition at the turn of the century, breeders in the U.S. set out to develop a related but distinct breed. They focused their breeding programs on increasing the pit bull's size and weight.\n\nThis effort led to the Staffordshire Terrier, which the AKC recognized in 1936. When the AKC later recognized the Staffordshire Bull Terrier from England in 1972, they decided to add “American” to the Staffordshire Terrier’s name to clearly delineate between the two breeds.\n\nToday, most AmStaffs live as peaceful, gentle family members. They've earned a great reputation and excel in many roles—including guarding, police work, and agility."},"facts":{"en":"Though known as a courageous and powerful breed, the American Staffordshire Terrier is also affectionate and loyal. Loving toward family members and excellent with children, these pups make calm, fun-loving household companions when responsibly bred and properly cared for."},"traits_appearance":{"en":"American Staffordshire Terriers are sturdy, agile, and highly aware of their surroundings. The breed exudes strength with a muscular body, broad skull, and powerful jaw."},"traits_coat_and_coloring":{"en":"The AmStaff's coat is short, shiny, and stiff to the touch. This breed can be any color with solid, parti-color, or patched black, brown, tan, brindle (black and brown striped), liver, red, or fawn. Black or blue mask and brindle are common in American Staffordshire Terriers. Dogs that are all white, more than 80% white, black and tan, and liver are not encouraged in the breed standard."},"traits_physical":{"en":"American Staffordshire Terriers are known for their well-defined, strong jaws. Their eyes are round, set far apart on the face, and typically dark. And their uncropped ears are short and held half prick or rose (an ear shape that resembles the petals of a rose).\n\nAmStaffs have a stocky build and are heavy for their size. They have relatively short, low-set tails that taper to a point."},"temperament":{"en":"American Staffordshire Terriers are very loyal to their families and usually good with children.\n\nKnown as intelligent, hard-working, and stoic, AmStaffs make excellent guard dogs. Though they're good-natured, they may be protective of their families. That said, they're not aggressive unless provoked.\n\nAmerican Staffordshire Terriers can be suspicious of people they don't know. And they may not get along well with unfamiliar dogs or small pets. [Early socialization]({%blogURL puppy-socialization%}) and training can help them be friendly toward other animals and strangers."},"care_nutrition":{"en":"American Staffordshire Terriers thrive on a high-quality diet that's appropriate for their life stage. Feeding a large-breed puppy formula can help keep your AmStaff pup from growing too fast and developing painful hip dysplasia later in life.\n\nTake care to monitor how much your dog eats and reduce portions if they gain too much weight. And remember to count calories from treats. As a general rule, they should make up no more than 10% of a dog's caloric intake."},"care_grooming":{"en":"The American Staffordshire Terrier's short coat and light shedding make it a very low-maintenance breed in terms of grooming.

(That said, fashionable sweaters can help!)\n\nStrong and athletic, AmStaffs also seem to enjoy dog sports—such as agility, flyball, and rally. Competitive [obedience training]({%blogURL dog-obedience-training%}) is another great option that not only reinforces desired behaviors but also provides your dog with mental exercise."},"care_training":{"en":"Obedient and relatively easy to train, AmStaff Terriers benefit from firm, dedicated training to temper their guarding tendencies.

Thought to be a descendant of the now-extinct \"St. John's Water Dog,\" they were trained to retrieve fishing nets from the icy waters of the North Atlantic. The breed's dense coat and strong swimming abilities made it ideally suited for this job.\n\nThese dogs—known at the time as simply the \"Lesser Newfoundland\"—eventually died out in the area. But before that happened, English fishermen brought the breed to England in the 19th century. There, they were lauded for their swimming, retrieving, and hunting skills. It's believed that the Labrador Retriever got its name from the Earl of Malmesbury. He fell in love with the dogs and coined the name \"Labrador\" or \"Lab\" to differentiate them from their Newfoundland ancestors.\n\nEnglish breeders refined the breed during the second half of the 19th century and are responsible for the Labrador Retrievers that we know and love today. A relatively new breed, the Labrador Retriever was recognized by the English Kennel Club in 1903, and the AKC in 1917.\n\nToday, Labrador Retrievers are beloved family dogs that enjoy agility, hunting, tracking, competitive obedience, and swimming. Labs are also commonly used as working dogs—employed as guide dogs, assistance dogs, search and rescue dogs, and contraband detection dogs."},"facts":{"en":"Labrador Retrievers are well-known for their outgoing, family-friendly personalities. Happy to work hard or play hard, these adaptable, good-natured dogs have earned their place as one of the world's most popular breeds."},"traits_appearance":{"en":"Labradors are strongly built dogs with short coupling (meaning, the space between their last rib and their pelvis is relatively short). They have broad skulls and are broad and deep through their chest and ribs."},"traits_coat_and_coloring":{"en":"The coat of the Labrador Retriever is short and dense, without any wave or feathering. Labs also possess a weather-resistance undercoat that protects them from water and cold temperatures.\n\nLabrador Retrievers come in solid black, chocolate, or yellow. The yellow varies from a pale cream to a rich red fox color. Some Labradors also have white chest blazes.\n\nLabradors typically have black or brown noses. In some yellow Labs, the nose color may fade to a lighter or dull pink color, known as a Dudley nose, as the dog ages."},"traits_physical":{"en":"Signature to Labrador Retrievers are a weather-resistant coat, drop ears, distinctive tails, and friendly, expressive eyes. Labrador Retrievers also have a unique tail that is very thick at the base and gradually tapers toward the tip.

Known for their happy-go-lucky, easy-going personalities, these dogs are always up for adventure. They like to be included in all aspects of family life.\n\nVery social dogs, Labrador Retrievers bond easily with people, as well as other dogs and pets. They are patient, affectionate, and trustworthy around children, making them excellent playmates and a welcome addition to most any family.\n\nThough generally calm and good-natured, some Labrador Retrievers can be quite energetic. They are well-suited for an active lifestyle filled with outdoor activities such as hiking and swimming."},"care_nutrition":{"en":"Labrador Retrievers need a high-quality, age-appropriate dog food. They will benefit from diets that are formulated for large-breed dogs. In particular, large-breed puppy diets prevent them from growing too fast, which can help protect them from hip dysplasia in adulthood.\n\nLabrador Retrievers have big appetites and, left to their own devices, will actively seek out human food and snacks. For this reason, they are prone to becoming overweight or obese. To keep their weight in a healthy range, their food intake—including treats—should be closely monitored."},"care_grooming":{"en":"To maintain a healthy coat, Labrador Retrievers should be brushed weekly (or more often during seasonal shedding periods).

Maintaining good dental hygiene is important for their overall long-term health."},"care_exercise":{"en":"The Labrador Retriever requires a lot of exercise to stay at a healthy weight and burn off extra energy (so they can maintain that calm, laid back demeanor). They enjoy daily walks and opportunities to run or swim.\n\nBecause they are retrievers by nature, Labs also love to play fetch and are often happiest when chasing after a ball or frisbee. If a Labrador doesn't get enough exercise, they can be prone to destructive behaviors, such as chewing or digging.\n\nFinally, it's important to give Labrador Retrievers plenty of mental exercise. This can include giving them puzzle toys or [practicing obedience commands]({%blogURL dog-obedience-training%}) with them."},"care_training":{"en":"Labrador Retrievers are intelligent and eager to please—a combination that makes them a relatively easy breed to train.

However, the British expression \"chow chow\" (describing odds and ends transported on cargo ships) could have also been the inspiration for the breed's name.\n\nThroughout history, Chow Chows have been faithful companions to nobility in China and elsewhere.

The Croats who settled the land brought their dogs, believed to be descendants of the Pfahlbauhund, to herd cattle and sheep in the plains of Slavonia. The Croatian Shepherd, also known as the Croatian Sheepdog, spread across Croatia and then throughout the rest of Europe.\n\nIn 1935, a Croatian professor began the first systematic breeding program for the Croatian Shepherd. It took more than three decades for a breed standard to be published."},"facts":{"en":"The Croatian Shepherd is a tireless herding dog that is active, agile, courageous, and has a boundless enthusiasm for work."},"traits_appearance":{"en":"The Croatian Shepherd is a medium-sized, compact, Spitz-type dog with a rustic appearance."},"traits_coat_and_coloring":{"en":"Croatian Shepherds have dense, compact, and soft undercoats their topcoats are profuse, dense, and soft with stand-off wavy to curly hair that can grow up to five-and-a-half inches long. Their hair is longer on the neck, back, croup, ribs, backs of the forearms and hindlegs with the longest part of their coats at the culottes near the root of their tails. It is shorter on their foreheads, on the muzzle, forehead, ears, around the eyes, on the cheeks, and on the front part of the forelegs. Males have longer, more profuse coats than females.\n\nCroatian Shepherds are black. A few (almost invisible) white hairs spread across their bodies and white markings on the chest are permitted. Their undercoats are black except during shedding season when the color might turn greyish or have a slightly brown tinge; neither is a fault."},"traits_physical":{"en":"Croatian Shepherds have rectangular-shaped bodies with horizontal, muscular backs; short, well-muscled loins; deep, broad chests; and tails that are strong at the root, tapered toward the tip, and carried above the topline when the dogs are alert. These dogs also have oval eyes; triangular ears with rounded tips that are carried either pricked or semi-pricked; and tapered muzzles; their facial features give Croatian Shepherds a fox-like expression."},"temperament":{"en":"While Croatian Shepherds exhibit traits such as alertness, intelligence, courage, and endurance that make them excellent working dogs, the breed is also patient and levelheaded, which are qualities that have endeared it to families as a loyal companion. The breed is known for being devoted to its owners and should be invited to participate in activities; left on their own, Croatian Shepherds could become unhappy and destructive.\n\nCroatian Shepherds are bundles of energy and love participating in outdoor activities but are also calm and relaxed in the house. A yard with a tall fence is a must as Croatian Shepherds are excellent jumpers and can easily scale a fence in search of adventure (and mischief).\n\nTheir working dog tendencies remain strong, making Croatian Shepherds excellent watchdogs."},"care_nutrition":{"en":"Feed Croatian Shepherds a high quality dog food that is appropriate for their life stage (puppy, adult, senior) and consider a diet formulated for active breeds.

Fear of the wolf, and its predation on domestic animals, led it nearly to extinction in the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nDespite the U.S. federal government’s plan to systematically poison the country’s wolf population, the Endangered Species Act now protects wolves.\n\nThis protection—and their quick reproductive cycles—has helped the wolf population rebound. In fact, a large-scale conservation effort to reintroduce wolves to Yellowstone National Park has been underway since 1995 and has been highly successful at restoring the population there."},"facts":{"en":"Did you know that wolves are technically members of the dog family? Though wild wolves have been, and continue to be studied by experts, much about these dog-like animals is relatively unknown to humans.

The most common type of wolf—the gray or timber wolf—usually has thick gray fur, but all black and all white varieties also exist."},"traits_physical":{"en":"One of the most common types of wolf, the gray or timber wolf can grow much larger than their dog counterparts. Other than their size, the iconic wolf howl is another feature that sets this animal apart from the dog."},"temperament":{"en":"Wolves are nomadic pack animals that tend to travel in groups of six to ten wolves, working together in a hierarchy.\n\nThey are steadfast hunters, traveling up to 12 miles in one day, and while they rarely attack humans, humans and wolves continue to have a cantankerous relationship likely due in part to the wolves’ instinct to prey on domestic animals.\n\nTheir behaviors are very similar to that of dogs—they enjoy playing amongst each other and chewing—but they are territorial and they will growl when they feel encroached upon."},"care_nutrition":{"en":"Wolves are carnivores, and they have quite an appetite. In fact, the larger of these animals (such as a gray or timber wolf weighing in at 175 pounds) eat up to 20 pounds of food in one meal.\n\nSmaller wolves—like red wolves—eat tinier prey like rodents and rabbits."},"care_grooming":{"en":"Wolves in the wild are surprisingly tidy animals that spend a lot of time keeping themselves clean.

Now extinct, ancestors of the Boxer included the Bullenbeiszer and the Barenbeiszer, which were used for hunting deer and boar. The crossing of these breeds with the English Bulldogs of the 1830s resulted in the Boxer as we know it today.\n\nBoxers were bred to be hunting dogs, and they earned their name from the boxing pose they take when standing on their hind legs. Later in the breed's development, they also gained some ability for herding.\n\nOver the years, Boxers have taken on many roles. These include athlete, cattle dog, police dog, war dog (in both World Wars I and II), watchdog, protection dog, and guide dog for the blind. They were also used for dogfighting and bull-baiting until those activities were outlawed. And circuses even used Boxers for their ability to learn tricks quickly and perform them on command.\n\nThe popularity of Boxers started to increase rapidly in the 1860s when the German Boxer Klub was founded. At the turn of the 20th century, the Boxer made its way to the United States, and the American Kennel Club officially recognized the Boxer in 1904."},"facts":{"en":"Boxers are intelligent, hardworking, and good-looking dogs.

It has a gentle nature and is good with other animals. Known to paw at their toys and food, Boxers can be expressive of their needs and temperament.\n\nA very protective breed, Boxers make excellent watchdogs and family guardians. Yet, they are typically friendly toward strangers. To promote their social development, you should expose them to various people and other animals in early puppyhood.\n\nBoxers are incredibly energetic and powerful even as puppies. So, bringing one into a home with young children or elderly adults may be unwise."},"care_nutrition":{"en":"Boxers require a high-quality dog food that is age-appropriate—whether it's commercially manufactured or homemade (with a veterinarian's supervision and approval). For puppies, experts recommend a food formulated for large breeds.\n\nBoxers tend to stay at a healthy weight. But it's still important to monitor the amount of food you give your Boxer and reduce portions or restrict calories if your pup gains weight. Also, remember that giving too many treats in addition to regular meals can cause obesity."},"care_grooming":{"en":"The short, shiny coat of the Boxer is relatively maintenance-free and requires little grooming.

The exact origin of the Dalmatian is highly-disputed. However, most people believe that the breed developed in Dalmatia, a region in southwestern Croatia that borders the eastern Adriatic Sea.\n\nThe name Dalmatia or \"Delmatia\" comes from the ancient Illyrian word meaning \"land of shepherds.\" And it was from this area that the breed received its name.\n\nIn 17th century England, Dalmatians worked as carriage dogs. Their speed, protective nature, and coaching instincts were invaluable when tasked with accompanying carriages and horseback riders and protecting them from threats along their journey. Later, Dalmatians put that same skill set to good use in their iconic role as firehouse dogs. They ran alongside horse-drawn fire engines and helped them maneuver through busy city streets.\n\nDalmatians received AKC recognition in 1888."},"facts":{"en":"The Dalmatian is a calm and gentle—but very active and intelligent—breed.

And, while a variety of coat colors are possible, black or liver are considered breed standard with the dog's nose sharing the color of its spots.

They are sleek, glossy, and have a very healthy appearance."},"traits_physical":{"en":"Dalmatians have medium-sized, somewhat rounded eyes set moderately well apart. These can be brown or blue.

They're triangular-shaped—wide at the base and tapering gradually to a rounded tip.\n\nA Dalmatian's tail tapers to the tip and has a slight upward curve."},"temperament":{"en":"Dalmations are an excellent breed for families that can provide frequent exercise and an active lifestyle. Without adequate exercise, Dalmatians may become hyper or turn to destructive behaviors.\n\nThough they're friendly dogs that love being with people, their energetic temperament makes them best suited for families with relatively older children.\n\nDalmatians tend to be loyal and affectionate with their families, and friendly with other pets. But they can be aloof with strangers, and male Dalmatians sometimes display territorial aggression toward each other. [Proper socialization]({%blogURL puppy-socialization%}) can help with these behaviors."},"care_nutrition":{"en":"As with all dogs, Dalmatians need high-quality food that's appropriate for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior).

Farmers needed a well-rounded breed that could herd cows, pull carts to market, guard the farm, and watch the children. The Dutch Shepherd fit the bill.\n\nThe Nederlandse Herdershonden Club developed the first breed standard in 1898. The original standard allowed all coat colors, but the standard was edited in 1914 to limit the Dutch Shepherd's coloring to brindle. This change was to distinguish it from other shepherd breeds, such as the [German Shepherd]({%breedURL german-shepherd-dog%}) and [Belgian Shepherd]({%breedURL belgian-sheepdog%}).\n\nThe Dutch Shepherd's versatile nature and strong work ethic have made this lesser-known breed popular for many jobs. Today they work as farm dogs, police dogs, search and rescue dogs, and guide dogs for owners with disabilities."},"facts":{"en":"Dutch Shepherds are athletic, intelligent, and independent dogs. Innate herding instincts have helped the breed earn a reputation as a world-class working dog that retains its wild ancestors' characteristics."},"traits_appearance":{"en":"Dutch Shepherds are medium-sized athletic dogs with hard, muscular, well-balanced bodies. They have free and smooth movements, endless endurance, and intelligent expressions."},"traits_coat_and_coloring":{"en":"Dutch Shepherds can have three different kinds of coats: short-hair, long-hair, and rough-hair. The short-hair coat is hard, close-fitting, and not too short, with the ruff, breaches, and tail plume visible.\n\nThe long-hair coat is long and straight (without curls or waves), and harsh to the touch. The ruff, breeches, and tail are distinct and abundantly coated while the hair on their heads, ears, feet, and hind legs below the hocks is short and densely coated.\n\nThe rough-hair coat is dense, harsh, and tousled. The hair on the upper and lower lips forms a mustache and beard. The hair over the eyes forms well defined, coarse eyebrows that are distinct but not exaggerated.\n\nIn all three coat types, the Dutch Shepherd has a woolly undercoat.\n\nDutch Shepherds are brindle in color. Their base color is silver or golden. In golden dogs, the base color can range from light sand to chestnut red with black or dark brown brindle. They may have a small amount of white on their chest or toes.\n\nThe brindle color may be less pronounced in Dutch Shepherds with rough coats because the tousled coat obscures the coloring."},"traits_physical":{"en":"Dutch Shepherds have solid, muscular bodies; deep, long chests; powerful legs; and tails that hang down with a slight curve. They have dark, almond-shaped eyes; medium-sized, erect ears; and strong jaws."},"temperament":{"en":"Dutch Shepherds are alert, watchful, reliable dogs that delight in completing a task. The breed is confident enough to work solo but also cooperative and willing to work alongside its owner or other dogs to get the job done. Their demeanors as active, independent, and persistent.\n\nDespite being bred for work, Dutch Shepherds know how to relax and will adjust their energy levels to the situation. As pets, Dutch Shepherds love spending time with their people and fit in well with active families. This is not a breed that wants to be left alone for long periods with nothing to do."},"care_nutrition":{"en":"Feed Dutch Shepherds a high-quality dog food that is appropriate for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior) and consider a diet formulated for active breeds. Although these high-energy dogs are not known for becoming overweight, portioning out their food with a measuring cup and limiting treats to no more than 10% of their daily calories can help prevent overfeeding."},"care_grooming":{"en":"A Dutch Shepherd's grooming needs depend on its coat type. The short-coated dogs require only occasional brushing, while long-haired Dutch Shepherds must be brushed once per week. Both short-and long-haired dogs will need extra brushing during spring and fall shedding seasons to remove cast-off hair and reduce shedding. In addition to brushing rough-coated Dutch Shepherds once per month, their coats need to be hand-stripped twice per year. A professional groomer can help.\n\nDutch Shepherds also require regular ear cleanings, nail trims, and a [dental care]({%blogURL dog-dental-care%}) routine that includes at-home teeth-brushing and professional cleanings. Start these grooming essentials when Dutch Shepherds are puppies to ensure they are part of a lifelong habit."},"care_exercise":{"en":"These all-purpose working dogs love to be on the move. Dutch Shepherds make great running companions and enjoy brisk walks, hiking, swimming, and trips to the dog park. These highly intelligent dogs also excel in agility, obedience, rally, dock diving, and—of course—herding. Mental stimulation is important, too. Puzzle toys and other games are helpful ways to keep their minds engaged."},"care_training":{"en":"With proper obedience training, Dutch Shepherds listen to their owners and follow instructions. However, without this training, they tend to be independent and make their own decisions. Avoid repetitive activities—these will cause Dutch Shepherds to lose interest. Fast-paced games and activities that combine mental and physical stimulation are best to keep them engaged (and help burn off energy). Focus on positive reinforcement and reward-based training."},"care_health":null,"published_at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","country_codes":["US","GB"],"ancestry_version_ids":["a726d077-0886-57b4-81d5-01362be36a09","b5bb33f8-400e-43f7-a48f-d6dfdcb8a6fa","ff9d3dfa-fad7-449e-bb69-ad820473897c"]}},{"percentage":2,"breed":{"id":"c4ad7dc2-5172-5f95-86dc-dd5e57063e83","slug":"mexican-street-dog","breed_group_id":"7c942f6a-db5b-540b-8530-5f1df4c36de3","weight_range_pet_min":"0.9","weight_range_pet_max":"29.9","weight_range_show_min":"0.9","weight_range_show_max":"29.9","height_range_min":"15.0","height_range_max":"61.0","life_span_range_min":"8.0","life_span_range_max":"18.0","created_at":"2020-05-11T17:40:40.500Z","updated_at":"2024-02-05T15:11:38.890Z","external_updated_at":"2021-03-29T19:20:31.000Z","external_id":"mexican-street-dog","external_source":"airtable","head_image_id":"1f49248a-7cf3-4c2a-8d45-747c2e61ab63","color_image_id":"4c5a0981-6898-41fb-9292-619ead1e3a4d","bw_image_id":"851ac0b5-6629-47e6-86b1-8beb44b7fab7","breed_size_group_id":"c678e1be-c426-5785-92df-14985140fb1d","internal_name":"Mexican Street Dog","references":"https://www.google.com/books/edition/What_Is_a_Dog/6tHECwAAQBAJ\n\nhttps://www.theepochtimes.com/despite-love-for-pet-dogs-mexico-has-highest-number-of-stray-dogs-in-region_2688301.html\n\nhttps://www.akc.org/expert-advice/vets-corner/dog-grooming-at-home/\n\nhttps://www.akc.org/expert-advice/health/how-much-exercise-does-dog-need/","reviewed_by":"Annette Louviere, DVM","date_reviewed":"2020-07-26T19:00:00.000Z","species":"dog","recommended_activity_mins_young":97,"recommended_activity_mins_adult":57,"recommended_activity_mins_senior":41,"allow_user_entry":true,"locales":["US","UK"],"name":{"en":"Mexican Street Dog"},"plural_name":{"en":"Mexican Street Dogs"},"history":{"en":"This scrappy, street-wise, catch-all breed likely descends from the stray and feral dog populations that roam the streets and beaches of Mexico.

So, if you bring one home, you should be prepared to meet their activity needs.\n\nMexican Street Dog puppies typically have more energy than adult dogs and need short bursts of exercise (e.g., brief walks or play sessions). An adult or senior dog, however, will have different energy levels. And in general, exercise needs vary from dog to dog, depending on their health and age. But if your dog seems stir-crazy or gets destructive, take that as a sign that they need to get out and move around."},"care_training":{"en":"Because of their experiences on the streets, Mexican Street Dogs often have a sensitive nature and respond best to motivational tools.
