The breed may have been the result of crossing the Techichi—a dog that played an important role in both the Toltec and Aztec cultures—and the [Chinese Crested dog]({%breedURL chinese-crested%}).\n\nThough the ancient civilizations were eventually destroyed, the resilient breed survived in Chihuahua, Mexico. It came to the United States in the late 1800s when Americans visiting Mexico took an interest in the dogs and brought them back home as souvenirs from their trips.\n\nAs more of these dogs made their way to the U.S., they were called many names—including Arizona Dogs, Texas Dogs, and Mexican Dogs. However, the name \"Chihuahua\" is what eventually stuck.\n\nThe Chihuahua became an AKC-recognized breed in 1904. It now consistently enjoys a spot on the list of most popular dog breeds in the U.S."

Some have undercoats made up of hair that is slightly longer. Smooth-haired Chihuahuas inherit their coats by carrying one or two copies of the dominant gene for short hair.\n\nLong-haired Chihuahuas have longer coats that are silky and either smooth or slightly wavy. Often they have fringe around the ears and tail. Long-haired Chihuahuas inherit their coats by carrying two copies of the recessive gene for long hair. A Chihuahua's coat can come in almost all possible colors and patterns and may include dark masks, merle, and white markings."

Deer head Chihuahuas have a longer, deer-like head with a more gradual slope where the muzzle joins the forehead. Deer heads typically have longer legs, larger ears, and tend to be larger in size.\n\nThe tail of the Chihuahua is set high and tapers as it reaches the tip. The carriage of the tail is an important trait—it's generally carried high and in a curved or semi-circular shape."

Chihuahuas don't typically enjoy being left alone for long periods. Luckily, their small size makes them an easy breed to take on frequent outings.\n\nIf not [properly socialized]({%blogURL puppy-socialization%}), Chihuahuas can be apprehensive and nervous around strangers or other dogs and pets. This may result in barking or even snapping when the dog feels anxious or threatened.\n\nChihuahuas can do well around children as long as kids aren't too rambunctious and are mindful not to scare these little pups. Very young children may struggle to keep their energy levels and movements subdued enough to make a Chihuahua feel safe.\n\n[House-breaking]({%blogURL potty-train-a-puppy%}) Chihuahuas can sometimes be challenging, requiring patience and more frequent potty breaks.

However, take care not to overfeed Chihuahuas. For such a small dog, even a couple extra treats can add up and lead to weight gain.\n\nChihuahuas should eat a diet created for small breed dogs (as well as their specific life stage).

Still, for mental stimulation, Chihuahuas should be able to go outside, sniff, and explore.

Sometimes called “sleeve dogs” because they could hide in the large sleeves of Chinese robes, Pekingese were accustomed to going everywhere with their doting owners. Palace eunuchs oversaw strict breeding programs, and Pekingese ownership was limited to those in the highest social classes. The dogs were so esteemed that commoners had to bow in their presence, and stealing a Pekingese was punishable by death.\n\nA British captain found five Pekingese dogs in a palace when troops invaded Peking (Beijing) in 1860. The dogs were transported back to England and given to Queen Victoria. These dogs with royal bearing fast became popular across Europe and, later, America. Ownership was once accessible to only the wealthiest families, but Pekingese are now among the most popular toy breeds."

On January 20, 1984, the first documented black, white, and tan Yorkshire puppy was born into their pack, and three months later, another arrived. These rare puppies possessed the piebald gene not usually found in Yorkies.\n\nThey eventually settled on the name Biewer Yorkshire Terrier. Margo Eskens, a German singer, purchased the unique puppies and renamed them the Biewer Yorkshire Terrier a la Pom Pon. This new breed made its debut to the public in 1986.\n\nBecause of their popularity, the Biewers couldn’t keep up with the business of breeding their namesake terriers, though other breeders have worked to replicate the same type of dog.\n\nSince this is a relatively new breed, there are no specific standards for the Biewer Terrier."

            "en": "The German Shorthaired Pointer, or GSP, was developed in Germany in the late 19th century to meet the need for an all-round hunting dog. Breeders sought to develop an excellent pointer with a good nose—a dog that could retrieve birds as well as animals.\n\nInitially, German hunters thought that a cross between a Spanish Pointer and Hannover Hound would possess these abilities. However, the resulting breed tended to bay when trailing. They then tried crosses with the Bloodhound, Foxhound, and various French hounds. But none hit the mark precisely.\n\nBreeding with the English Pointer finally resulted in a dog that appeared perfect. Still, even this breed had an aversion to water and tracking at times. Fortunately, continuous breeding eliminated these unwanted traits. And the German Shorthaired Pointer became a lean, athletic, and responsive breed.\n\nThe German Kennel Club first registered the breed in 1872. German Shorthaired Pointers arrived in the United States in the 1920s. Impressed by the versatility of the breed after reading an article about it, a man named Charles R. Thornton shipped two dogs to his home in Missoula, Montana.\n\nThe American Kennel Club recognized the German Shorthaired Pointer as a breed in 1930. Today, it's consistently one of the top-winning breeds in competitive hunting events."

GSPs enjoy being around people and want nothing more than to be included in family life.\n\nThis breed is usually safe around other pets and dogs. But it's not uncommon for them to display dominant behavior. Because of their hunting instincts, they love to play and chase. However, GSPs may choose unwilling playmates, such as cats or wildlife.\n\nGerman Shorthaired Pointers make commendable watch dogs. And though they may be reserved with strangers, they are generally very sociable dogs.\n\nGSPs are an intelligent and highly energetic breed. They mature later than other breeds. The resulting elongated \"puppy phase\" can be challenging for some owners.\n\nGerman Shorthaired Pointers need plenty of activity and exercise to be happy. If they get bored, they may take it upon themselves to find things to do, which can lead to undesired behaviors, such as barking or digging."

To help prevent this condition, don't feed your dog immediately after any kind of vigorous activity. And wait at least an hour after meals before allowing them to run or exercise.\n\nTo keep your dog at a healthy weight, monitor their food intake carefully. Avoid accidental overfeeding by measuring out meals. And don't forget to account for treats in their daily calorie totals. As a guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of a dog's calories."

During periods of heavy shedding, your GSP will need frequent brushing to remove loose hairs and prevent them from ending up in unwanted places.\n\nIt's also smart to trim nails regularly to keep them short and tidy. Overgrown nails can split and become painful, or lead to issues walking or running.\n\nIn addition to professional dental cleanings, establish an at-home dental care routine that includes regular daily teeth brushing.

            "en": "Dogs that carry this mutation are asymptomatic until they are exposed to a medication that uses the pump that is rendered defective by the mutation in the MDR1 (also called ABCB1) gene. Drugs known to use this P-glycoprotein pump are macrocyclic lactones (antiparasitic drugs), loperamide (antidiarrheal), erythromycin (antibiotic), acepromazine (tranquilizer), butorphanol (opioid), and certain drugs used in cancer treatment (vincristine, vinblastine, and doxorubicin). When these medications are administered, they accumulate in the brain which results in the adverse reactions. Typical symptoms include tremors, loss of balance, seizures, obtundation, excessive salivation, dilated pupils, and bradycardia. If untreated, the condition may lead to respiratory arrest, coma or death. Because dogs with one copy of the mutation will have some P-glycoprotein function, the most severe cases tend to occur in dogs that have two copies of the mutation and therefore lack any functional P-glycoprotein pumps.

IMPORTANT: Resulting puppies must be tested for the MDR1 mutation to ensure safe future medical treatment. If a dog with one copy of the MDR1 mutation is bred with a clear dog with no copies of the MDR1 mutation, about half of the puppies will have one copy and half will have no copies of the MDR1 mutation.
