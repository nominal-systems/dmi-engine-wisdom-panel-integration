They were bred as hunting dogs and used to locate and retrieve game from land and water.\n\nSir Dudley Majoribanks, Lord of Tweedmouth, conducted the initial efforts to breed the Golden Retriever. He kept detailed records of breedings between 1840 and 1890. His goal was to create a dog that could handle the rainy weather and rugged terrain of the Scottish Highlands. He began with a yellow dog from Brighton and an English retriever with a liver-colored curly coat called a Tweed Water Spaniel, now extinct.\n\nHe later introduced Labrador Retrievers, Newfoundlands, Red Setters, and Bloodhounds into the mix. The Kennel Club of England accepted the breed in 1903 as the \"Golden Flat Coat.\" It was the first breed to be shown in an English dog show in 1908.\n\nThe breed was introduced to the United States in the late 1890s, and it received the name \"Golden Retriever\" in 1920. The American Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1932.\n\nToday, Golden Retrievers are among the most popular family dogs, thanks to their compatibility with other dogs and people. They are great members of the family, and they excel as both guide and assistance dogs and search and rescue dogs."},"facts":{"en":"The Golden Retriever is an intelligent breed that excels in a wide range of duties and activities. In fact, it's one of the most versatile dog breeds in the world. Golden Retrievers are active, loving, and eager to please. They also have a very gentle temperament. Given all this, it's no surprise that they're among the most popular dogs in the U.S."},"traits_appearance":{"en":"Golden Retrievers are symmetrical, powerful, balanced dogs. Their eyes offer a friendly, intelligent expression."},"traits_coat_and_coloring":{"en":"The Golden Retriever's coat is dense enough to be textured, though it's neither short nor especially long. They also have a water-resistant undercoat.\n\nAs the name suggests, the breed is generally a rich golden color, ranging from a light gold to a darker reddish gold. The coat and tail are feathered with paler creams, though the dog is never white."},"traits_physical":{"en":"Golden Retrievers have strong, well-balanced bodies and short coupling (meaning, the space between their last rib and their pelvis is relatively short).\n\nTheir eyes are medium-large with dark, close-fitting rims, set well apart. The preferred color is dark brown, though some have medium-brown eyes. The Golden Retriever's tail is thick and muscular at the base. It's carried level, or with a slight upward curve."},"temperament":{"en":"Golden Retrievers are one of the best breeds for families. They're devoted and affectionate to their people, and love being involved in all family activities.\n\nThey're generally happy-go-lucky dogs, and many maintain their puppy-like attitudes into adulthood. Though typically a calm, easy-going breed, Goldens can sometimes be energetic or nervous.\n\nTheir friendly nature makes them poor watchdogs, but they make excellent pets and wonderful aids for the elderly and disabled. They're playful and trustworthy with children, and typically get along with other pets and dogs.\n\nGolden Retrievers need ample attention and human companionship, as well as regular exercise. Due to their retriever instincts, they'll try to carry just about anything they can get into their mouths. For them, retrieving is a favorite pastime. So, the way to a Golden Retriever's heart may just be through a game of fetch."},"care_nutrition":{"en":"To meet a Golden Retriever's nutritional needs, you should feed a high-quality food that's appropriate for their life stage (e.g., puppy, adult, senior.) They will benefit from diets formulated for large-breed dogs. In particular, large-breed puppy diets keep them from growing too fast, which may decrease the incidence or severity of hip dysplasia as they age.\n\nGolden Retrievers are prone to gaining weight. To prevent obesity, you should closely monitor their food intake. Avoid accidental overfeeding by measuring out their portions using a standard measuring cup, and be sure to account for treats when calculating their daily calorie intake. As a general guideline, treats should make up no more than 10% of their daily calories."},"care_grooming":{"en":"Golden Retrievers need to be brushed about two times a week. Twice a year, they shed their thick undercoats. During these periods, you will likely need to brush more frequently.\n\nTrimming nails, cleaning ears, and [brushing teeth]({%blogURL dog-dental-care%}) should also be part of every dog's grooming routine, regardless of breed."},"care_exercise":{"en":"To maintain their calm demeanors, Golden Retrievers need plenty of daily exercise. And they enjoy many activities, including jogging, fetch, and trips to the dog park.\n\nGolden Retrievers also enjoy dog sports—such as hunting, tracking, and agility. They love to swim, as well. For a fun game that takes advantage of their natural swimming ability and affinity for water, try playing fetch with floating toys.\n\nIt's also important for Golden Retrievers to exercise their minds. Achieve this by giving them puzzle toys or [practicing obedience]({%blogURL dog-obedience-training%}) commands with them."},"care_training":{"en":"Golden Retrievers are eager to please, which makes them fairly easy to train if you use gentle but firm techniques. They're also very food-motivated. This may make it easier to teach them to drop retrieved items not intended for play (such as one of your favorite shoes.)"},"care_health":null,"published_at":"2023-07-05T16:27:26.614Z","country_codes":["US","GB"],"ancestry_version_ids":["a726d077-0886-57b4-81d5-01362be36a09","b5bb33f8-400e-43f7-a48f-d6dfdcb8a6fa","ff9d3dfa-fad7-449e-bb69-ad820473897c"]}}],"ideal_weight_result":{"id":"dbe4d5cf-f8d2-470a-b8cc-46d9b3f3a0aa","result_set_id":"31d7b5df-a4e5-47b4-8089-bd20c1443555","female_pred_size":22.7,"female_min_size":17.7,"female_max_size":29.9,"male_pred_size":26.7,"male_min_size":20.9,"male_max_size":35.4,"spayed_pred_size":24.4,"spayed_min_size":18.6,"spayed_max_size":31.3,"neutered_pred_size":28.3,"neutered_min_size":22.2,"neutered_max_size":35.8,"created_at":"2024-04-16T21:34:28.998Z","updated_at":"2024-04-16T21:34:28.998Z"},"notable_and_at_risk_health_test_results":[{"id":"d2510c8e-f166-445c-b456-6127f456dae9","health_result_id":"17ea8950-88d3-4877-9271-50988817cace","health_test_id":"11eb1d26-7603-596b-a00c-e697076b5bb8","copies":2,"result_male":"at-risk","result_female":"at-risk","created_at":"2024-04-16T21:34:29.030Z","updated_at":"2024-04-16T21:34:29.030Z","health_test":{"id":"11eb1d26-7603-596b-a00c-e697076b5bb8","test_name":"025_MDR1","slug":"mdr1","onset_age":1,"likelihood":5,"disease_severity":3,"mode_of_inheritance":"autosomal dominant","gene":"MDR1/ABCB1","typical_allele":"I","variant_allele":"D","chromosome":"14","coordinate_start":13726599,"coordinate_end":13726596,"show_technical_details":true,"locus_name":"MDR1","disease_category":"Drug response","version":null,"excluded_region":null,"licensed_regions":null,"enabled":true,"enabled_v3":true,"enabled_product_versions":"WH,RC,BFMX","content_status":null,"frequency_one_or_more":0.02009799,"pmid":null,"video_link":null,"article_link":null,"created_at":"2020-05-15T20:39:59.049Z","updated_at":"2024-02-29T22:52:13.240Z","species":"dog","category":"complication","locales":["US","UK"],"disease_name":{"en":"MDR1 Medication Sensitivity"},"disease_long_name":{"en":"Multidrug Resistance 1, (MDR1)"},"disease_short_name":{"en":"MDR1"},"what_is_the_disease":{"en":"The MDR1 gene mutation causes a defect to a drug pumping protein that plays an important role in limiting drug absorption and distribution (particularly to the brain).

Affected dogs are slower to eliminate these drugs from the body and can suffer side effects when exposed to certain medications. This condition is sometimes called \"ivermectin sensitivity.\" However, the name is a misnomer as several other drugs pose a risk to MDR1 positive dogs. Adverse reactions can occur when affected dogs are exposed to some common drugs, however, all FDA approved heartworm preventatives are safe to administer to MDR1 positive dogs. This mutation is inherited in a dominant fashion though dogs with two copies of the mutation will exhibit more severe clinical signs.\n"},"clinical_description":{"en":"Dogs that carry this mutation are asymptomatic until they are exposed to a medication that uses the pump that is rendered defective by the mutation in the MDR1 (also called ABCB1) gene. Drugs known to use this P-glycoprotein pump are macrocyclic lactones (antiparasitic drugs), loperamide (antidiarrheal), erythromycin (antibiotic), acepromazine (tranquilizer), butorphanol (opioid), and certain drugs used in cancer treatment (vincristine, vinblastine, and doxorubicin). When these medications are administered, they accumulate in the brain which results in the adverse reactions. Typical symptoms include tremors, loss of balance, seizures, obtundation, excessive salivation, dilated pupils, and bradycardia. If untreated, the condition may lead to respiratory arrest, coma or death. Because dogs with one copy of the mutation will have some P-glycoprotein function, the most severe cases tend to occur in dogs that have two copies of the mutation and therefore lack any functional P-glycoprotein pumps. However, the condition can still be very severe in dogs that have only one copy of the mutation.\n"},"next_steps":{"en":"For dogs with copies of the MDR1 mutation it is important to be aware of medications which may result in an adverse reaction. These include: Acepromazine, Butorphanol, Doxorubicin, Doramectin, Emodepside, Erythromycin, Ivermectin, Loperamide, Milbemycin, Moxidectin, Paclitaxel, Rifampin, Selamectin, Vinblastine, Vincristine. It is best to explore alternative medications that will not use this P-glycoprotein pump or, at minimum, consider reduction of the dose to levels safe for an MDR1 positive dog.\n"},"breeder_advice_disease_specific":{"en":"This disease is autosomal dominant meaning that one copy of the mutation is needed for signs of this disorder to occur.  For some breeds where the MDR1 mutation frequency is particular high, breeders may consider matings using dogs that have one or two copies of the MDR1 mutation to maintain genetic diversity within their breed. IMPORTANT: Resulting puppies must be tested for the MDR1 mutation to ensure safe future medical treatment. If a dog with one copy of the MDR1 mutation is bred with a clear dog with no copies of the MDR1 mutation, about half of the puppies will have one copy and half will have no copies of the MDR1 mutation. If a dog with two copies of the MDR1 mutation is bred with a clear dog, the resulting puppies will all have one copy of the mutation. Please note: It is possible that disease signs similar to the ones caused by the MDR1 mutation could develop due to a different genetic or clinical cause."},"video_link_title":null,"article_link_title":null,"references":{"en":"Mealey, K.
