Now extinct, ancestors of the Boxer included the Bullenbeiszer and the Barenbeiszer, which were used for hunting deer and boar. The crossing of these breeds with the English Bulldogs of the 1830s resulted in the Boxer as we know it today.\n\nBoxers were bred to be hunting dogs, and they earned their name from the boxing pose they take when standing on their hind legs. Later in the breed's development, they also gained some ability for herding.\n\nOver the years, Boxers have taken on many roles. These include athlete, cattle dog, police dog, war dog (in both World Wars I and II), watchdog, protection dog, and guide dog for the blind. They were also used for dogfighting and bull-baiting until those activities were outlawed. And circuses even used Boxers for their ability to learn tricks quickly and perform them on command.\n\nThe popularity of Boxers started to increase rapidly in the 1860s when the German Boxer Klub was founded. At the turn of the 20th century, the Boxer made its way to the United States, and the American Kennel Club officially recognized the Boxer in 1904."

But modern Bulldogs make for much friendlier pups.\n\nThe ancestors of Bulldogs—Bullenbeissers, Asian dogs resembling Mastiffs—served as military dogs for the Romans, Teutons, and Celts. And when the Bullenbeissers came to England, breeders worked to reduce the dog's overall size while increasing its head size. The resulting dog was very effective at bull baiting (i.e., pitting a bull against another animal), earning the name \"English Bulldog.\"\n\nExperts believe Bulldogs were first brought to the United States in 1735. Just 100 years later, bull-baiting was outlawed, and breeders started to eliminate the dog's aggressive tendencies. As a result, today's Bulldogs are much calmer and better suited to family life than the Bulldogs of the past."

But thanks to breeding programs set up by John D. Johnson and Alan Scott, the American Bulldog survived. There are now two American Bulldog types named after the breeders: the Johnson, also known as the classic or bully type, and the Scott, which is sometimes called the standard or performance type.\n\nIn 1970, the National Kennel Club officially recognized and registered the American Bulldog breed.

Experts think breeders then crossed these smaller Bulldogs with the Black and Tan Terrier to produce the Staffordshire Bull Terrier.\n\nDogfighting ultimately lost its popularity, and the sport was banned in 1835. Still, the Staffordshire Bull Terrier remained a favorite breed of working-class families. Eventually, a group of workers in the Staffordshire area preserved the breed by introducing it into the world of dog shows.\n\nThe Kennel Club in England officially accepted the breed in 1935, and the American Kennel Club followed suit in 1974."

Mastiffs also served in war. Legend has it that at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415, a Mastiff defended his wounded master, Sir Peers Legh, for many hours until he was rescued. This is just one example of what Mastiffs are known for: protecting their masters and property.\n\nThe Mastiff likely made its way to America aboard the Mayflower. But few Mastiffs were imported to the United States until the late 1800s. And after Britain passed laws in 1835 that banned baiting sports, the breed fell in popularity and began to disappear. After World War II, the Mastiff faced extinction. Fortunately, proponents of Mastiffs imported them and eventually re-established the breed."

They crossed various terriers and bulldogs, and the resulting dogs made their way to the United States in the late 1800s.\n\nThough originally used for dogfighting, these early pit dogs had a gentle, hard-working nature. As a result, the breed quickly gained a loyal following, and farmers began employing the dogs as herders, guardians, hunters, and companions.\n\nThe United Kennel Club was the first club to recognize the American Pit Bull Terrier in 1898. (Fun fact: The UKC founder’s own dog was the first to be registered.) And the American Dog Breeders Association accepted the APBT in 1909. APBTs have since appeared in TV shows, advertising, and even propaganda posters for the two World Wars. Today, this popular breed serves as a working dog, therapy dog, and devoted family companion.\n\nThe American Kennel Club was reluctant to register a breed once associated with dog fighting, which led to the creation of the related (but distinct) [American Staffordshire Terrier]({%breedURL american-staffordshire-terrier%}), originally called the Staffordshire Terrier, in 1936"

But such a friendly nature—even towards strangers—often makes them ill-suited as guard dogs.\n\nAPBTs are happiest when with their family. They definitely prefer participating in activities and outings to spending long periods at home alone.\n\nThese brave, confident pups require [early socialization]({%blogURL puppy-socialization%}) and obedience training to help them develop into predictable, well-mannered adult dogs."

            "en": "American Pit Bull Terriers thrive on a high-quality diet that's appropriate for their life stage. During puppyhood, consider feeding your dog a large-breed puppy formula to prevent them from growing too fast. Growing at a moderate pace can help prevent or reduce the severity of painful hip dysplasia later in life.\n\nRemember to monitor the amount of food you give your APBT and reduce portions back if they gain excess weight. And be sure to track calories from treats. Ideally, they should make up no more than 10% of a dog's daily caloric intake."

            "en": "The APBT's short coat is very low-maintenance. Weekly brushing with a soft-bristled brush and an occasional bath are generally all that’s needed to keep it in tip-top condition.\n\nTo reduce your dog's chance of ear infections, check their ears regularly and clean them as needed to remove wax build-up and debris. Nail trims should also be part of their grooming routine. If your pup's nails grow too long, they can cause pain and potentially lead to problems running or walking.\n\nLastly, a good [dental care]({%blogURL dog-dental-care%}) routine will support your dog's overall health. In addition to scheduling professional cleanings, create an at-home dental program that includes regular teeth brushing and veterinarian-recommended dental chews."

Ideal activities include long walks on a leash, runs (APBTs make excellent jogging buddies), or chasing a ball in the backyard.\n\nThese sporty dogs also enjoy agility, flyball, rally, lure coursing, and dock jumping. Another great option for this breed is competitive [obedience training]({%blogURL dog-obedience-training%}). It not only reinforces desired behaviors but also provides your dog with mental exercise."
